        <p>It’s a little early to tell what this will turn into.</p>
        <p>
          It begins as a ramshackle refugee camp, necessitated by the failure of
          <a href="http://thatsmags.com/shanghai/blog/features/urban-future">Urban Future</a>
          to provide:<br />
          (a) stability, (b) continuous scrolling, and (c) an adequate platform
          for comments. As things develop, other basics (such as a blogroll) can
          be expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment, longer posts will go up on UF, with a link here for
          discussion. Is that sounding like a satisfactory medium-term solution?
          (Not to me either.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this supportive role, <em>Outside in</em> will have a few
          specialized functions, as:
        </p>
        <p>(1) A sandpit for unconsolidated thoughts on time-related topics</p>
        <p>
          (2) A depository for brief commentary and links (from the perspective of
          harsh neo-reaction)
        </p>
        <p>(3) A flotation chamber for fragments of morbid fiction</p>
        <p>
          If that doesn’t look repulsive enough yet, we’ll see what we can do …

          Federico has kicked the living daylights out of me (on
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/352/">this</a> thread), and only the
          outer darkness remains. It’s a passage through singularity, so
          mathematical consistency requires me to be
          <em>infinitely</em> appreciative of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of Neocameralism, drawing all its real functionality from Exit,
          is parasitic upon what lies beyond it: the Patchwork of competitive
          alternatives. Since an exterior disintegration does all the work, why
          not fold the outside in?
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s time to come out as a <strong>Xenomist</strong>. All power to the
          Outside!

      <section class="post">
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/urban-future-2-0/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Urban Future (2.0)</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          The new <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/">UF blog</a> is up and running
          now, with a few teething problems expected. The platform is much more
          reliable than the old one, but its idiosyncrasies still require some
          getting used to. Comments, especially, might be troublesome at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intention is to use it as a platform for material that isn’t (in one
          way or another) off the wall. There’s nothing much up yet except some
          tentative posts on the structure of history, urbanization, economic
          development, and the recent regime transition. (There’s also a product
          promo, providing a clue to the underlying economic base of the blog,
          which is still extremely embryonic at this stage.)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <em>Urban Future (2.0)</em> is my work blog, which means it will be
          connected up to e-publication projects – realized and prospective – with
          a Shanghai dimension. Hopefully that will be mostly synergic, rather
          than intrusive. Self-marginalization will be restrained by the
          commercial reality-principle over there, so the content only comes in
          vanilla flavor right now. (If I can keep it vaguely respectable,
          blogging gets included in billable time.) A few rum-soaked raisins will
          probably creep in, but anything too intoxicating will end up here (in
          Outer Darkness).
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not exactly clear at this stage how specialization between these
          blogs will work, so there’s an experimental aspect. The neater the
          crystallization into artificial good twin / bad twin schizophrenia, the
          smoother it should run.  It might end up being necessary to run light
          side / dark side versions of the same post on occasions. ‘Politeness’ in
          this contexts starts from <em>Outside in</em> criteria of minimal
          civility, then super-adds sensitivity to the norms of present day
          metropolitan China <em>and</em> those of low-friction trans-national
          commerce. It is easier, at least at first, to investigate the edges of
          these normative systems here than over there. (More on this topic
          later.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Decorous commentary on China, history and economics is especially
          welcome, and the range of discussion should gradually expand, with some
          responsiveness to reader interest. Anyone with the irresistible urge to
          howl like a werewolf – even about UF content – is advised to do that
          here, where the risk of immediate deletion, whilst by no means
          negligible, is considerably smaller.

      <section class="post">
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chaos-patch-1/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Chaos Patch (#1)</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          A blog closely models a patchwork-embedded neocameral micro-state, which
          is to say that its governance is dictatorial, controlled by external
          competition. Internally, it’s God-king stuff: zero-democracy, undivided
          power without constitutional constraint, absolute discretion tilting
          into sorcerous extremities. The sole counter-balance comes from outside,
          sustained by a freedom of exit no less highly realized than the
          administrative power it evaluates. If people don’t like what’s
          happening, they leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the (virtual) neocameral state it models, a blog stages a dramatic
          collision between administrative authority and radical liberty. Admin
          and commentators coordinate tacitly to make things work, already
          conjoined in the production of value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commentators speak for themselves. That is their work and investment,
          which the blog exploits, to develop. Necessarily, therefore, from the
          side of the sim-neocameral Admin, there are inescapable but obscure
          responsibilities. Undoubtedly, among the first of these, is the
          maintenance of order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three aspects of order are especially
          relevant at this point (although there are others).<br />
          (1) Troll eradication. This responsibility has been very undemanding at
          <em>Outside in</em> so far. The prospect of prompt and certain
          liquidation, coupled with a minimally-efficient comment processing
          system, deters troll invasion to a truly remarkable extent.<br />
          (2) Ensuring civility. This is a far hazier and potentially more
          challenging task, involving cooperative interaction between multiple
          parties. There are sure to be micro-ethnographic theories that relate to
          it, because a blog ecology is a small, artificial culture, and
          reasonable differences exist as to how these can be propagated, nudged,
          incentivized, and / or directed. These are questions for another
          time.<br />
          (3) Entropy suppression — finally, our topic. How does a blog climb
          backwards along the incline into chaos, perpetually restoring the order
          of <em>things in their place</em>, or <em>on-topic commentary</em>? How
          to maintain a micro-culture that, in its balance of creative liberty and
          efficient order, is more Singaporean than Somalian?
        </p>
        <p>
          The emergent policy of <em>Outside in</em> is to be troll-free and
          civil, but beyond this it aims to be minimally suppressive. It does,
          however, aspire to the perpetuation and development of order. Its model
          comment thread is coherent, even in its diversity and controversy, which
          is to say that <em>on-topic commentary</em> is its ideal. Departures
          from this are registered as error, and in fact as classical entropy, or
          disordered distribution. The solution presently entertained is
          <em>zoned liberty</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flagrantly off-topic commentary will be increasingly discouraged, but
          regular ‘chaos patches’ (or open threads) will ensure that any civil
          remark has a place. If your comment would be obviously out of place on
          any given thread — and thus effectively entropic (I’m looking at you
          Fotrkd and Northanger) — it would be to our mutual advantage if it were
          directed towards the most recent Chaos Patch. In exchange for
          cooperation in this respect, <em>Outside in</em> neocameral Admin
          proposes the following deal:
        </p>
        <p>
          Use Chaos Patches (CPs) neatly, like a good pseudo-Singaporean, and
          Admin commits to:<br />
          (a) Read all CP contents (and avoid all temptation to treat them as
          black-hole entropy-bins).<br />
          (b) Introduce new CPs on request (request to be made in latest CP).<br />
          (c) Thematically direct each CP according to the content unfolding
          within it, by providing — at least minimally — an ADDED directory
          function, plus discussion where possible.<br />
          (d) Modify the CP concept in response to feedback, with open-ended
          flexibility, given only the understanding that entropy regulation is an
          indispensable Admin responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s see how it goes …</p>
        <p>
          ADDED: CP#1 Topic Summary:<br />
          — Thoughts on blog commentary<br />
          — What (the hell) does Continental Philosophy contribute to Dark
          Enlightenment?<br />
          — Web search systems, social media, and soft Cathedralism<br />
          — Handle’s ‘Darkest Enlightenment’ (as glimpsed
          <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/randoms-110/">here</a>)<br />
          — ‘How about you and
          <a href="http://www.amormundi.blogspot.sg/">him</a> fight?’<br />
          — Phallic leftism<br />
          — Sodomite abomination<br />
          — Did Turing screw up computer science?<br />
          — Streaming reaction
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussion diffuses, so the order listed here is only an inexact
          approximation.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Meta’ (or ‘admin’) questions predominate at this stage — how is
          commentary most effectively handled? Since no one has yet staked a claim
          to the lead CP#2 topic, I’ll begin from there. Current assumption: once
          the number of comments exceeds 100, it’s time to make more space. Does
          this seem reasonable?

        <p>
          There’s a seemingly irrepressible enthusiasm to discuss
          <em>Outside in</em> speech codes, so let’s do it here (please). For the
          precursor exchanges on the topic, see
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chu-on-this/">here</a>, and

        </p>
        <p>
          I only became a methodical Moldbug reader in 2011, so I cannot pretend
          to have followed the degeneration of the
          <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> comments section in real time. What I
          did see, making my way back through this blog, was the rapid collapse of
          its comment threads into an open cultural gutter of no conceivable
          interest to anybody with a three digit IQ — a situation that hit nadir
          and remained there. We are talking about what — even
          <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2014/08/hiatus.html">inactive</a>
          — remains arguably the most important blog in the history of the medium.
          If anyone wants to suggest that its accrued commentary is a model to be
          emulated, they are encouraged to make the case, for the entertainment
          value alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the other extreme of cognitive ambition, is
          <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/">4chan/pol/</a>, a veritable sewer
          of senselessness, where the idea of an intelligent conversation is an
          absurdity from the start. This is a discussion forum that revels in its
          own crass vulgarity. It too is a negative model, to be deeply
          appreciated for the lesson in degeneracy it provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          My default assumption is that everything tends to ruin, unless actively
          tended. <em>UR</em> shows what a naked <em>laissez-faire</em> policy
          leads to, if crudely interpreted as confidence in self-correcting
          bohemianism. Spontaneous order requires dynamic entropy dissipation
          merely to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is not a commons. It welcomes
          visitors who add value, tolerates those who do no harm, and ejects
          agents of degradation. Up to this point, policing here has been very
          light, but there is no firm principle behind that. If it becomes
          necessary, the full panoply of police powers will be exercised without
          the slightest liberal qualm, and these are potentially considerable.
          Insofar as the space of this blog itself are concerned, they are in fact
          effectively unlimited. Occasional demented goblins seem to derive great
          satisfaction from provoking crack-downs. If these individuals are
          deluded enough to think that inciting such responses represents some
          kind of cognitive dissonance here, by driving a departure from the
          generally tolerant policy in place, they are very much mistaken. The
          only rigid principle here is absolute (local) authority. Gibbeting
          goblins poses no ideological contradiction whatsoever. There should
          probably be a great deal more of it, the more random and graphically
          brutal the better, just to make this point. (This auto-suggestion is
          being taken under advisement.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A more difficult problem is posed by the right vulgarians, at least
          superficially. Their intentions are not, it appears, disruptive. They
          merely seek to crank down the general tone of commentary here to a more
          popular level, with direct rhetorical offensiveness to progressive
          sensibilities considered a positive factor. I have to confess to finding
          some of these visitors likable, but their objectives will not be
          tolerated. With the conclusion of this discussion — at the latest — the
          desired tone here will be <em>imposed</em>, by whatever mixture of
          selection, editing, and scolding is required. This is not a negotiable
          matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Chaos Patch
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chaos-patch-1/">here</a> drew an
          analogy between a blog and a virtual micro-state. Considered at a
          sufficient level of abstraction, the principles of governance are
          basically identical. Authority is absolutely concentrated, guided by the
          incentive to maximize the value of an estate, which only subsequently
          introduces pragmatic policies of extreme
          <em>laissez-faire</em> tolerance, since freedom maximizes productivity.
          People here are basically free to say whatever they like, with the
          understanding that
          <em>scum will be ejected without apology or reservation</em>. Anyone
          tempted to explore the limits of tolerated scumminess has profoundly
          misunderstood what is going on here. Once again, this is not disputable
          beyond the norms of tolerated disputation. Scum have no rights here,
          whatsoever, and the only definition of scum behavior that matters is
          that decided by the government or local sovereign power (and that’s me).
        </p>
        <p>
          So what counts as scum behavior? Basically: classlessness or incivility.
          There are absolutely no limits being set on the ideas that can be
          promoted by visitors here, as long as they are presented with some
          minimum of decorum. Vulgarity, slurs, abuse, snark, and scum rhetoric in
          general, on the other hand, is not acceptable. Intelligent or humorous
          comments that cross some of these lines will not be suppressed, if their
          transgressions plausibly serve a higher cultural purpose. Sovereign
          Admin alone decides each problematic case with absolute discretion,
          perhaps drawing upon advice from other respected commentors where
          appropriate. Yes, this is an elitist dictatorship (duh!).

        </a>
        <p>
          Kill the hyphen, <em>Anomaly UK</em> advised (somewhere) – it lets
          Google Search dissolve and avoid the subject. Writing ‘neo-reaction’ as
          ‘neoreaction’ nudges it towards becoming <em>a thing</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Search gets to edit our self-definition? That’s the ‘neo’ in
          ‘neoreaction’, right there. It not only promotes drastic regression, but
          highly-advanced drastic regression. Like retrofuturism, paleomodernism,
          and cybergothic, the word ‘neoreaction’ compactly describes a
          time-twisted vector that spirals forwards into the past, and backwards
          into the future. It emerges, almost automatically, as the present is
          torn tidally apart — when the democratic-Keynesian politics of
          postponement-displacement exhausts itself, and the kicked-can runs out
          of road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressed with
          <a href="http://anomalyuk.blogspot.com/2013/04/introduction-to-neoreaction.html">abstruse verbosity</a>,
          therefore, neoreaction is a time-crisis, manifested through paradox,
          whose further elaboration can wait (if not for long). Disordering our
          most basic intuitions, it is, by its very nature, difficult to grasp.
          Could anything easily be said about it?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Anomaly UK
          <a href="http://anomalyuk.blogspot.com/2013/04/introduction-to-neoreaction.html">offers</a>
          a down-to-earth explanation for the reversal of socio-political course:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ultimately, however, if after all these centuries of trying to
            improve society based on abstract ideas of justice have only made life
            worse than it would have been under pre-Enlightenment social systems,
            the time has come to simply give up the whole project and revert to
            traditional forms whose basis we might not be able to establish
            rationally, but which have the evidence of history to support
            them.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This understanding of neoreaction – undoubtedly capturing its
          predominant sentiment – equates it with a radicalized Burkean
          conservatism, designed for an age in which almost everything has been
          lost. Since the progressive destruction of traditional society has been
          broadly accomplished, hanging on to what remains is no longer enough. It
          is necessary to go back, beyond the origin of Enlightenment, because
          Reason has failed the test of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neoreaction is only <em>a thing</em> if some measure of consensus is
          achievable. Burke-on-steroids is an excellent candidate for that.
          Firstly, because
          <em>all neoreactionaries define themselves through antagonism to the
            Cathedral</em>, and the Cathedral is the self-proclaimed consummation of
          Enlightenment rationalism. Secondly, for more complicated, positive
          reasons …
        </p>
        <p>
          Spandrell helpfully
          <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/conflict">decomposes</a>
          neoreaction into two or three principal currents:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There are two lines of [our contemporary] reactionary thought. One is
            the traditionalist branch, and [the other is] the futurist branch.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Or perhaps there [are] three. There’s the religious/traditionalist
          branch, the ethnic/nationalist branch, and the capitalist branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Futurists and traditionalists are distinguished by distinct, one-sided
          emphases on ‘neo’ and ‘reaction’, and their disagreements lose identity
          in the neoreactionary spiral. The triadic differentiation is more
          resiliently conflictual, yet these ‘branches’ are branches of something,
          and that thing is an ultra-Burkean trunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reactionary theonomists, ethno-nationalists, and techno-commercialists
          share a fundamental aversion to rationalistic social reconstruction,
          because each subordinates reason to history and its tacit norms – to
          ‘tradition’ (diversely understood). Whether the sovereign lineage is
          considered to be predominantly religious, bio-cultural, or customary, it
          originates outside the self-reflective (enlightenment) state, and
          remains opaque to rational analysis. Faith, liturgy, or scripture is not
          soluble within criticism; communal identity is not reducible to
          ideology; and common law, reputational structure, or productive
          specialism is not amenable to legislative oversight. The
          <em>deep order of society</em> – whatever that is taken to be – is not
          open to political meddling, without predictably disastrous consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Burkean junction, where neoreactionary agreement begins, is also
          where it ends. Divine revelation, racial continuity, and evolutionary
          discovery (catallaxy) are sources of ultimate sovereignty, instantiated
          in tradition, beyond the Cathedral-state, but they are self-evidently
          different – and only precariously compatible. Awkwardly, but
          inescapably, it has to be acknowledged that each major branch of the
          neoreactionary super-family tends to a social outome that its siblings
          would find even more horrifying than Cathedralist actuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Left intellectuals have no difficulty envisaging Theocratic
          White-Supremacist Hyper-Capitalism®. In fact, most seem to consider this
          mode of social organization the modern Western norm. For those
          hunkered-down in the tangled, Cathedral-blasted trenches of neoreaction,
          on the other hand, the manifold absurdities of this construction are not
          so easily overlooked. Indeed, each branch of the reaction has dissected
          the others more incisively – and brutally – than the left has been able
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          When theonomists scrutinize ethno-nationalists and techno-commercialists
          they see evil heathens.<br />
          When ethno-nationalists scrutinize theonomists and techno-commercialists
          they see deluded race-traitors.<br />
          When techno-commercialists scrutinize theonomists and ethno-nationalists
          they see retarded crypto-communists.<br />
          (The details of these diagnoses exceed the present discussion.)
        </p>

          When developed beyond its ultra-Burkean trunk, therefore, the prospects
          for neoreactionary consensus – for <em>a neoreactionary thing</em> –
          depend upon disintegration. If we’re compelled to share a post-Cathedral
          state, we’ll kill each other. (The zapped hyphen was just a foretaste.)

        <p>In the end, it’s all comes down to harsh realism.</p>
        <p>Socialists imagine there are no wolves, so democracy is easy.</p>
        <p>Conservatives imagine democracy as a way for wolves to apologize.</p>
        <p>
          Libertarians imagine democracy as two wolves and a sheep deciding on the
          main course for dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neoreactionaries see democracy as two sheep and a wolf deciding on the
          merits of mandatory vegetarianism.

          <em>Democracy is closer to two sheep and a wolf voting on what’s for
            dinner. The sheep unite in collective action to fight off the wolf.
            The wolf, stripped of its natural power, must graze alongside the
            sheep. Eventually it dies from malnutrition, and the sheep, having
            lost their natural predator, soon overpopulate and overgraze their
            land. Then they die too, usually replaced by another species
            entirely.</em>

        </a>
        <p>
          As anticipated, the organization of the <em>Outside in</em> blogroll is
          transforming itself from a mechanical task into an engaging
          cultural-political and philosophical
          <a href="http://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/reaction-and-its-peripheries">problem</a>. My sense is
          that
          people generally resolve this type of quandary on a
          fairly hasty, <em>ad hoc</em> basis, but it already seems too late to do
          that. There are legacy considerations, and intricacies of coalitional
          variety at stake. Ultimately, there is a question about the core
          significance of the term ‘neoreaction’ — Is it a mere rallying point,
          flung into prominence by arbitrary historical opportunity, or is it a
          dense <em>concept</em>, whose semantic components are to be scrupulously
          respected?
        </p>
        <p>
          My temptation would be to tactically elude the word, in order to access
          a more flexible, differentiated terminology. What prevents me from doing
          so is the arrogant sense that I <em>respect the word</em> more than
          anyone else it is applied to. ‘Neoreaction’ is an inherently
          paradoxical, fissional term, splitting in-itself on a temporal axis. It
          follows that I am extremely reluctant to see it relegated to a mere
          categorical marker, employed to designate ideological tendencies whose
          substantial content is better — or more fully — explicated in other
          terms. The word <strong>Neoreaction</strong> declares, intrinsically,
          that it belongs to fissionalist time-junkies exploring historical
          dissociation. That’s what it <em>says</em>, irrespective of how it is
          used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem of categorization, therefore, remains, indissolubly. Any
          suggestions?

        </a>
        <p>
          Whilst pedestrian in its rehearsal of common knowledge, and inane in its
          tortured liberalism,
          <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/article-bd.cfm?piece=1496">this</a>
          article helpfully schematizes the arena of Anglophone racial politics,
          at least on its defining black-white dimension (and accidentally). By
          counterposing the tradition of Black American self-advancement
          (represented by Booker T. Washington) with that of Afro-Marxist
          agitation (represented by W. E. B. Du Bois), it implicitly describes an
          ideological quadrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To side with Du Bois against Washington is the position of the
          radical Left.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To seek a reconciliation of the two is an agonized equivocation,
          tilting inevitably to Leftist advantage, of the kind that has
          predominated in the development of Anglophone political culture. This is
          is position of the author, of mainstream liberalism and conservatism,
          and of progressive Cathedralization.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To admire Washington, whilst repulsed by Du Bois, is the
          neoreactionary stance <em>Outside in</em> defends.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To dismiss both Washington and Du Bois as irrelevant Black nonsense
          is a departure into confrontational White Nationalism, of a kind that
          has no imaginable reach beyond itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas Sowell, as the most articulate inheritor of the ‘outsider’
          Washington tradition, is the emblem of this racial ideology test today.
          Neoreaction is indisputably mostly a White thing, but if it is to have
          any additional significance whatsoever, Sowell has to be supported.
          There’s nowhere further Right he could possibly go, except into some
          species of Black ethnomasochistic suicidalism — and we should know, more
          than anybody, that’s a corner no one should be backed into.

          Anton Silensky
          <a href="http://www.moreright.net/the-cult-of-neoreaction/">initiates</a>
          a structured discussion on the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Neoreaction is not a popular movement, a political party, a
          church, an organization, or even in any strong sense <em>one thing</em>,
          what is it? I’m assuming that if it is more than a fight over a name, it
          is at least a coalition, integrated by a shared enemy, and some common
          references.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only canonical scripture I am able to identify is the
          <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> corpus. This is certainly not ‘gospel’
          for anyone, but it constitutes the distinctive intellectual heritage of
          those who identify positively with the neoreactionary current.
          Neoreaction has to be at least tenuously ‘Moldbuggian’ if it is not to
          dissipate entirely into noise. There are, however, already many
          Moldbugs, and there will be still more.
        </p>

          Silensky writes: “Splitting will happen. People will disagree. And they
          will leave.”

        <p><em>Leave what?</em> (That, I think, is his question.)</p>
        <p>
          <em>And if splitting is intrinsic to what the Neoreaction is?</em> (That
          is mine.)

          With my nervous-system still too disintegrated by turn-of-the-year
          excess to begin a set of 2014 prognoses convincingly, I’ve simply
          stripped this argument from my twitter stream (quoting myself):
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Neoreaction cannot understand itself without directing far more
            sustained attention to its own cladistic identity. As a natural
            cultural species, it is a fragment of dissident ultra-protestantism,
            and this is quite certain to guide its fate. The forces of internal
            fragmentation working through it will make fratricidal Trotskyism look
            like unperturbed mind-meld. It will be thriving this time next year,
            but the tides of dissolution it will have overcome to do so will be
            truly colossal. Those thinking Neoreaction is a platform from which to
            complacently deride Neo-Puritanism have a highly-educational 2014
            ahead.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Neoreaction is not a series of
          <a href="http://www.moreright.net/premises-of-reactionary-thought/">premises</a>
          (or articles of faith) but a <strong>cultural species</strong>. I don’t
          think that we have begun to seriously digest the consequences of that
          yet.

          Patri Friedman is both extremely smart and, for this blog among others
          in the ‘sphere, highly influential. So when he
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/patri.friedman/posts/10152224034719766">promises</a>
          us “a more politically correct dark enligh[t]enment” (“adding
          anti-racism and anti-sexism to my controversial new pro-monogamy
          stance”), that’s a thing. It accentuates concerns about ‘entryism’ and
          ideological entropy, leading to some thoughtful responses such as
          <a href="http://avengingredhand.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/the-necessity-of-a-neoreactionary-doctrine/">this</a>
          (from <em>Avenging Red Hand</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael Anissimov anticipated this in a
          <a href="http://www.moreright.net/premises-of-reactionary-thought/">post</a>
          at <em>More Right</em> on the ‘Premises of Reactionary Thought’,
          which begins: “To make progress in any area of intellectual endeavor
          requires discourse among those who agree with basic premises and the
          exclusion of those who do not.” (The
          <a
            href="http://cathedralwhatever.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/premises-of-reactionary-thought-taking-stock/">commentary</a>
          by Cathedral Whatever is also well worth a look.) Anissimov’s original
          five premises, subsequently updated to six (with a new #1 added) are:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>1. People are not equal. They never will be. We reject equality in
            all its forms.</em><br />
          <em>2. Right is right and left is wrong.</em><br />
          <em>3. Hierarchy is basically a good idea. </em><br />
          <em>4. Traditional sex roles are basically a good idea.</em><br />
          <em>5. Libertarianism is retarded.</em><br />
          <em>6. Democracy is irredeemably flawed and we need to do away with
            it.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          These neoreactionary ‘articles’ deserve a
          response in detail, but at this point I will simply advance at
          alternative list, in the expectation that yet other versions will be
          forthcoming in the near future, providing a reference for discussion. My
          objective (in keeping with the advice from ARH) is economy, honed
          through abstraction, in the interest of sustaining productive diversity.
          <em>Minimally</em>, we affirm:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. <strong>Democracy is unable to control government</strong>. With this
          proposition, the effective possibility of a mainstream right is denied.
          Insofar as any political movement retains its allegiance to the
          democratic mechanism, it conspires in the ratchet of government
          expansion, and thus essentially dedicates itself to leftist ends. The
          gateway from Libertarianism to Neoreaction opens with this
          understanding. As a corollary, any politics untroubled by expansionist
          statism has no reason to divert itself into the neoreactionary path.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.
          <strong>The egalitarianism essential to democratic ideology is incompatible
            with liberty</strong>. This proposition is partially derivative from #1, but extends
          further. When elaborated historically, and cladistically, it aligns with
          the Crypto-Calvinist theory of Western (and then Global) political
          evolution. The critique it announces intersects significantly with the
          rigorous findings of HBD. The conclusions drawn are primarily negative,
          which is to say they support a principled rejection of positive
          egalitarian policy. Emergent hierarchy is <em>at least tolerated</em>.
          More assertive, ‘neofeudal’ models of ideal social hierarchy are
          properly controversial within Neoreaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.
          <strong>Neoreactionary socio-political solutions are
            ultimately Exit-based</strong>. In every case, exit is to be defended against voice. No society or
          social institution which permits free exit is open to any further
          politically efficient criticism, except that which systematic exit
          selection itself applies. Given the absence of tyranny (i.e. free exit),
          all forms of protest and rebellion are to be considered leftist
          perversions, without entitlement to social protection of any kind.
          Government, of whatever traditional or experimental form, is legitimated
          from the outside — through exit pressure — rather than internally,
          through responsiveness to popular agitation. The conversion of political
          voice into exit-orientation (for instance, revolution into
          secessionism), is the principal characteristic of neoreactionary
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the perspective of this blog, no premises beyond these — however
          widely endorsed within Neoreaction — are truly basic, or defining.
          Resolution of elaborate disputes is ultimately referred to dynamic
          geography, rather than dialectic. It is the Outside, working through
          fragmentation, that rules, and no other authority has standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          [If anyone asks “How did this post suddenly jump from ‘the Dark
          Enlightenment’ to ‘Neoreaction’?” my response is “Good point!” (but one

          The position of <em>Outside in</em> (admittedly extreme) is that NRx
          <strong>is</strong> Neocameralism. As this equation ceases to persuade,
          NRx falls apart, and no future convergence point will be found within
          itself. It will be scavenged apart into Dark Libertarian and IQ-boosted
          ENR debris, unless neocameralism is either re-animated as its
          fundamental doctrinal commitment, or rigorously reconstructed into
          something <em>specifically</em> new. Hence today’s Quote
          <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-4.html">note</a>
          (from Moldbug’s <em>How Dawkins got pwned (part 4)</em>):

          <em>In order to get to the reactionary theory of history, we need a
            reactionary theory of government. History, again, is interpretation,
            and interpretation requires theory. I’ve described this theory before

            but on a blog it never hurts to be a little repetitive.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>First: government is not a mystical or mysterious institution. A
            government is simply a group of people working together for a common
            aim, ie, a corporation. Whether a government is good or bad is not
            determined by who its employees are or how they are selected. It is
            determined by whether the actions of the government are good or
            bad.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Second: the only difference between a government and a “private
            corporation” is that the former is <strong>sovereign</strong>: it has
            no higher authority to which it can appeal to protect its property. A
            sovereign corporation owns its territory, and maintains that ownership
            by demonstrating unchallenged control. It is stable if no other party,
            internal or external, has any incentive to attack it. Especially in
            the nuclear age, it is not difficult to deter prospective
            attackers.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Third: a good government is a well-managed sovereign corporation.
            Good government is efficient management. Efficient management is
            profitable management. A profitable government has no incentive to
            break its promises, abuse its citizens (who are its capital), or
            attack its neighbors.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fourth: efficient management can be implemented by the same
            techniques in sovereign corporations as in nonsovereign ones. The
            company’s profit is distributed equally to holders of negotiable
            shares. The shareholders elect a board, which selects a CEO.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Fifth: although the full neocameralist approach has never been tried,
            its closest historical equivalents to this approach are the
            18th-century tradition of enlightened absolutism as represented by
            Frederick the Great, and the 21st-century nondemocratic tradition as
            seen in lost fragments of the British Empire such as Hong Kong,
            Singapore and Dubai. These states appear to provide a very high
            quality of service to their citizens, with no meaningful democracy at
            all. They have minimal crime and high levels of personal and economic
            freedom. They tend to be quite prosperous. They are weak only in
            political freedom, and political freedom is unimportant by definition
            when government is stable and effective.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sixth: the comparative success of the American and European postwar
            systems appears to be due to their abandonment of democratic politics
            as a practical mechanism of government, in favor of a civil-service
            <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamtenstaat">Beamtenstaat</a>
            in which democratic politicians are increasingly symbolic. The
            post-communist civil-service states, China and Russia, appear to be
            converging on the same system, although their stability is ensured
            primarily by direct military authority, rather than by a system of
            managed public opinion.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Seventh: the post-democratic civil-service state, while not utterly
            disastrous, is not the end of history. It has two problems. One, the
            size and complexity of its regulatory system tends to increase without
            bound, resulting in economic stagnation and general apathy. Two, more
            critically, it can neither abolish democratic politics formally, nor
            defend itself against changes in information flow that may destabilize
            public opinion. Notably, the rise of the Internet disrupts the
            feedback loop between public education and political power, allowing
            noncanonical ideas to flourish. If these ideas are both rationally
            compelling and politically delegitimating, the state is
            threatened.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Eighth: therefore, productive political efforts should focus on
            peacefully terminating, restructuring and decentralizing the
            20th-century civil-service state along neocameralist lines. The ideal
            result is a planet of thousands, even tens of thousands, of
            independent city-states, each managed for profit by its
            shareholders.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note that this perspective has nothing at all in common with the
            Universalist theory of government. Note also the simplicity of the
            transition that it suggests <strong>should</strong> have happened,
            from monarchy as a family business to a modern corporate structure
            with separate board and CEO, eliminating the vagaries of the
            hereditary principle.</em>

          Nick B. Steves defines ‘<a
            href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Neoreactionary&amp;defid=7747864">Neoreactionary</a>‘
          for
          the <em>Urban Dictionary</em>, with concision, clarity, and
          accuracy. Altogether, a valuable and well-executed piece of work. The
          format comes in two parts, with an initial definition, followed by an
          example of usage. This one begins:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Neoreactionary</strong>. A new
            <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Reactionary">reactionary</a>; typically one coming
            to
            reactionary ideas and conclusions by way of
            post-libertarian and/or post-anarchist paths; like traditional
            reactionaries one who is profoundly anti-progressive and suspicious of
            all egalitarian ideologies, but often more focused on free market
            capitalism as a solution to, or escape from, social ills than his
            ethnic or religious identitarian forebears; often, but not
            exclusively, one influenced by the writings of several well-known
            reactionary bloggers in the 2007-present timeframe.</em>
        </p>
        <p>With some breakfast-table usage exemplified:</p>
        <p>
          <em>As a natural conservative Bill sympathized with part of the agenda of
            the Center Right party, but as a neoreactionary he knew that it was
            merely an ineffectual brake on the progress of the left. He advocated
            for a new yet very ancient politics in which traditional give and take
            politics no longer was a factor.</em>

          <h4 class="post-title">Disintegration</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          As argued here
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/meta-neocameralism/">before</a>,
          <em>Outside in</em> firmly maintains that the distinctive structural
          feature of NRx analysis is escalation by a logical level. It could be
          described as ‘meta-politics’ if that term had not already been
          <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2010/11/on-metapolitics/">adopted</a>, by thinkers in the ENR
          tradition,
          to mean something quite different
          (i.e. the ascent from politics to culture). There’s an alternative
          definition
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapolitics">at</a> Wikipedia
          that also seems quite different. This congested linguistic territory
          drives NRx to talk about Neocameralism, or Meta-Neocameralism — the
          analysis of Patchwork regimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this perspective, all discussion of concrete social ideals and
          first-order political preferences, while often entertaining, locally
          clarifying, and practical for purposes of group construction, is
          ultimately trivial and distracting. The fundamental question does not
          concern the kind of society we might like, but rather the
          differentiation of societies, such that distinctive social models are
          able — in the first place — to be possible. The rigorous NRx position is
          lodged at the level of disintegration as such, rather than within a
          specific disintegrated fragment. This is because, first of all,
          <em>there will not be agreement about social ideals</em>. To be stuck in
          an argument about them is, finally, a trap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this not simply Dynamic Geography, of the Patri Friedman
          <a href="http://patrifriedman.com/projects/socs/commented/drawer/dynamic_geography.html">type</a>? As a
          parallel
          post-libertarian ‘meta-political’ framework, it is
          indeed close. The thing still missing from Dynamic Geography (as
          currently intellectually instantiated), however, is
          <em>Real Politik</em> (or Machiavellianism). It assumes an environment
          of goodwill, in which rational experimentation in government will be
          permitted. The Startup Cities
          <a href="http://www.startupcities.org/">model</a>, as well as its close
          <a href="http://urbanizationproject.org/blog/charter-cities">relative</a>
          Charter Cities, have similar problems. These are all post-libertarian
          analyses of governance, at a high logical level, but — unlike NRx — they
          are not rooted in a social conflict theory. They expect to formulate
          themselves to the point of execution without the necessity of a
          theoretical and practical encounter with an implacable enemy.
          ‘Irrational’ obstruction tends to confuse them. By talking about the
          <a
            href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified.html">Cathedral</a>,
          from the beginning, NRx spares itself from such naivety.
          (Sophisticated conflict theory within the libertarian tradition has to
          be sought
          <a href="http://agorism.info/docs/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf">elsewhere</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>Some initial points:</p>
        <p>
          (1) Meta-Neocameralism — or high-level NRx analysis — opposes itself
          solely to geopolitical integration. This means, as a matter of
          historical fate, to the Cathedral. An alternative social ideal, however
          repugnant it might be found at the level of first-order political
          preferences, is only elevated to a true enemy by universalism. If it
          seeks to do something — even something that revolts all actually
          existing NRx proponents to the core of their being — within a specific
          territorial enclave and without practical mechanisms for universal
          propagation, it is as likely to be a tactical ally as a foe. Anything
          that disintegrates destiny is on our side. (Immediately, therefore, it
          can be seen that the preponderant part of NRx discussion is at best
          oblique to fundamental strategic goals.)
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Universality is poison. Whenever NRx appears to be proposing a
          social solution for all people everywhere it has become part of the
          problem. The ultimate goal is for
          <em>those who disagree to continue to disagree</em> in a different
          place, and under separate institutions of government. First-order
          political argument, insofar as it tends towards compromise (i.e. partial
          convergence) is positively harmful to the large-scale NRx project.
          <em>The sole crucial agreement is that we will not agree</em>. Better by
          far to make that harsher, than to soften it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Each thread of the
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomocracy/">Trichotomy</a> has
          approximately equivalent claim to be the standard bearer of the
          disintegrationist position. The reason that this is formulated here with
          a Techno-Commercial bias is because it is being formulated here (there
          is no reason why it has to be).
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) A Meta-Neocameral coalition, tightly focused upon effective
          hostility to the Cathedral, displays a pattern of tolerances and
          aversions very different to that found within a first-order reactionary
          movement seeking to immediately instantiate a social ideal of the good.
          Insofar as the latter tends to exacerbation of social tensions and
          geopolitical fission, it contributes* positively to high-level NRx
          goals, but it can only expect theoretical condescension in direct
          proportion to its concreteness, and therefore deficient apprehension of
          the <em>disintegrative position</em>. A movement of communistic localism
          that successfully pursued a project of radical geopolitical
          autonomization would be, realistically, a more significant tactical ally
          than even the most ideologically-pure concrete reactionary movement
          which spoke a lot about comparable goals, but gave no indication it was
          able to practically realize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) The world is already fractured and divided, to a considerable
          degree. This means that the disintegrative position has no need for
          utopianism, and is frequently able to orient itself defensively, in
          support of existing differences that are subject to
          integrative-universalist assault. Furthermore, there are numerous
          indications that general world-historical trends are favorable to
          geopolitical disintegration, in too many fields to fully enumerate, but
          which include political, ethnic, technological, and economic drivers.
          Incremental pragmatism is entirely practical under current geographical
          and historical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) In provisional conclusion, disapproval of some alternative mode of
          life is entirely irrelevant to high-level NRx goals, unless said mode of
          life also insists upon living with you. The objective is to
          <em>divide the world</em>, not to unify it in accordance with those
          principles best attuned to your preferences, however rationally or
          traditionally compelling such preferences might be. Universalism is the
          enemy. Don’t do it (and to make a scholastic objection out of the
          universality of non-universalism, is to have immediately started doing
          it — check your totalitarian Hegelianism).
          <em><strong>Exit is not an argument</strong></em>.
        </p>
        <p>* Initially misspelled as ‘contribrutes’ — which works.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/">ADDED</a>: I should
          already have linked to this. It starts off on a very
          promising path, goes along OK until falling apart horribly somewhere in
          Part V, then stumbles along, recovering a bit, ending on an encouraging
          note (but with the theoretical engine now mostly sheared off). It’s high
          on my agenda for a serious engagement.

          <h4 class="post-title">Bonds of Chaos</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          There are many, I know, who find obstinate invocations of NRx — as a
          micro-slogan, cultural brand, conflictual stance, or Schelling point —
          to be crude at best, and perhaps thoroughly deluded, or worse. It is as
          if, having tumbled into a vogue, one has become enthralled by it, locked
          into stuttering, mechanical, thoughtless repetition. Those most
          skeptical about the sign are most likely disposed to mournfulness about
          it, whether decrying it for congenital flaws, or lamenting its loss of
          intellectual productivity and direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, I disagree. NRx is still a cultural infant, far younger than
          the Millennium, even under the most mythically-creative extension of its
          genesis, and the cognitive ferment it catalyzes remains extraordinary.
          It has still scarcely begun. The ties of a consistent name are the very
          least that are required to concentrate it. NRx, whatever it turns out to
          be, needs lashing together, because explosions tend to fly apart — and
          it is unmistakably an explosion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creative coincidence, or convergent diversity, is the mark of a culture
          at work (which is to say, in process). Yesterday, September 3,
          demonstrated this vividly. Approaching the conclusion of a
          multi-aspected
          <a href="http://www.newinternationaloutlook.com/2014/09/03/in-defence-of-dugin/">post</a>
          on Dugin, ethnicity, religion, and the “dementia’ of being, NIO
          suggests:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Referring to Chaos would seem in this circumstance to be an option of
            incredible potential, indeed, if you look closely enough at NRx the
            hints are already there that
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/on-chaos/">Chaos</a> is a central
            defining characteristic of the thought of all branches of the
            Trichotomy on multiple levels. Chaos creates order, in fact Chaos is
            also a form of order, just one which is not immediately
            understandable.</em>
          [I will not fake an apology for the self-looping internal link, since it
          it is one that would in any case have been made here.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling that NIO explicitly invokes the ontological depths of Chaos —
          its
          <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm">Hesiodic</a>
          as well as metaphysical density — it is especially remarkable to find,
          on the same day, an intricate
          <a href="http://mitrailleuse.net/2014/09/03/towards-a-neoreactionary-aesthetic/">post</a>
          by E. Antony Gray, which advances an innovative tripartite schema as the
          key to the aesthetic core of NRx. This text, too, culminates in a call
          for an integrative expedition into chaos, staged out of the void:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… the ‘face of the deep’ in Genesis is a primordial unformed, unseen
            void; That it is called ‘water’ in the Septuagint Greek lets us know
            something about the peculiar state of Chaos in the Void. The Void is
            thus Darkness but not shadow (a shadow is a deprivation of light
            caused by an object) but rather the substrate of all existence, only
            properly ‘unseen’ when no physical light is present. [… ] Chaos is
            substantial where disorder is insubstantial. Chaos is the
            ‘quintessence’ of things, chaotic itself and yet always-begetting
            order. Breaking down disorder, since disorder is maladaptive. Exit is
            a way to induce bifurcation, to quickly reduce entropy through
            separation from the highly entropic system. If no immediate exit is
            available, Chaos will create one.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          To denounce the exhaustion of NRx is an absurdity. It is an exploratory
          departure, scarcely initiated. To cling to its sign is to subscribe to
          its impulse, and to set out …

          at <em>First Things</em> explains:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bible law requires a radical decentralization of government under the
            rule of the righteous. Private property rights, especially for the
            sake of the family, must be rigorously protected, with very limited
            interference by the state and the institutional church. Restitution,
            including voluntary slavery, should be an important element of the
            criminal justice system. A strong national defense should be
            maintained until the whole world is “reconstructed” (which may be a
            very long time). Capital punishment will be employed for almost all
            the capital crimes listed in the Old Testament, including adultery,
            homosexual acts, apostasy, incorrigibility of children (meaning late
            teenagers), and blasphemy, along with murder and kidnapping. There
            will be a cash, gold-based economy with limited or no debt. These are
            among the specifics broadly shared by people who associate themselves
            with the theonomic viewpoint.</em>

          <em>A reconstructed world ruled by future Rushdoonyites will not,
            needless to say, be democratic. Rushdoony is straightforward in
            condemning democracy as a “heresy.” He writes that he is in agreement
            with John Dewey on the proposition that “supernatural Christianity and
            democracy are inevitably enemies.”</em>

          <h4 class="post-title">NRx Thought</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          It isn’t entirely clear whether Warg Franklin is asking:
          <em>How does NRx think?</em> Nevertheless, his
          <a href="http://thefutureprimaeval.net/postrationalism/">introduction</a>
          to postrationalism cannot but contribute to such a question (whether the
          latter is taken descriptively, prescriptively, or diagonally). The
          excellent onward links merit explicit mention (<a href="http://meaningness.com/metablog/how-to-think">1</a>,
          <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.ca/2007/08/reservationist-epistemology.html">2</a>,
          <a href="https://yearlycider.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/postrationality-table-of-contents/">3</a>).
        </p>
        <p>How NRx thinks is a critical index of what it is.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Outside in</em> is <em>probably</em> ‘postrationalist’. What it
          certainly is, however, is <em>disintegrationist</em>. It translates the
          caution against rationalist <em>hubris</em> — dubbed
          <em>reservationism</em> by Moldbug (in the link provided) — as a general
          antipathy to global solutions (and their attendant universalist
          ideologies). To be promoted, in the place of any Great Answer, is
          computational fragmentation. Whenever the research program meets an
          obstacle, divide it. “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” Or
          at least, since selection is inescapable, defend the fork (as such)
          first, and the chosen path only secondarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delegate selection to Gnon. To do so not only husbands resources, but
          also maximizes overall experimentation. Intelligence is scarce. It is
          needed, above all, for tinkering well. Global conceptual policing is an
          exhausting waste, and an unnecessary one, since territorial
          distribution, or some effective proxy, can carry it for free. Security
          capacity is needed to fend off those determined to share their mistakes.
          Using it, instead, to impose any measure — whatsoever — of global
          conformity is a pointless extravagance, and a diversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether articulated as epistemology, or as meta-politics, NRx is aligned
          with the declaration: <em>There is no need for us to agree</em>. Refuse
          all dialectics. It is not reconciliation that is needed, but definitive
          division. (Connect, but disintegrate.)
        </p>
        <p>Think in patches. Eventually, some of them will work.</p>

          <h4 class="post-title">Doom Circuitry</h4>
        </a>
        <p>This is what XS maintains:</p>
        <p>
          There is perfect philosophical integrity between the tragic foundations
          of Occidental Civilization and the cybernetic industrialism that defines
          its ultimate limit. Within this <em>neoreactionary</em> frame, reaction
          is never regressive enough, nor modernity ever advanced enough.
          Something more comforting — less distant — <em>will be</em> seized upon
          in both temporal directions. That is the minor theme of fate. No
          effective constituency could ever want to push far enough in either
          direction, to the point where the circuit of time closes, upon
          <em>doom</em> (coldly understood). It does not matter, because politics
          does not. Doom matters. The rest is pitiful species vanity, tragedy, and
          control malfunction. It will burn, without comprehending why.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the perspective of doom — only glimpsed, slowly, after vast
          disciplines of coldness — everything you are trying to do is a desperate
          idiocy that will fail, because humanism (<em>hubris</em>) is the one
          thing you can never let go. The drama dictates that. There’s no point
          flagellating yourself over it. The cosmos is not so poor in flagellation
          that it requires your meager contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yes we can!” is everything Neoreaction is not. Perhaps you even see
          that. Yet you repeat it with every measure you propose. Take your
          favorite ideological slogan and attach “Yes we can!” as an appendix. If
          it works, you now know the <em>epoch</em> to which you belong.
        </p>
        <p>Only doom <em>can</em> (and <em>will</em>).</p>
        <p>Carry on, though. You will, in any case. It entertains the gods.</p>

          <h4 class="post-title">Elysium</h4>

        <p>
          Having finally got around to
          <a
            href="http://takimag.com/article/elysium_neill_blomkamp_fools_the_critics_again_steve_sailer"><em>Elysium</em></a>, 
          one point in particular bears emphasis: There’s only one interesting
          character in the movie, and she’s a neoreactionary heroine. That’s not a
          matter of ideological preference. Among the tiny number of characters
          who might imaginably be thought to know what they’re doing, Secretary of
          Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is the only one to be treated
          with the slightest seriousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.xenosystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/elysium0.jpg"><img alt="elysium0"

        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a potentially intriguing snakehead gangster (‘Spider’ played by
          Wagner Moura), but he loses all credibility by morphing without
          explanation into Robin Hood. (Note to Hollywood: Snakeheads are not
          carried by any obvious vector of social interest to become proponents of
          radically open borders — it’s just possible that Blomkamp is screwing
          with your mind.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Soulless capitalist John Carlyle (William Fichtner) is reduced to plot
          prey, whilst the Elysium Davos-liberal President Patel (Faran Tahrir) is
          nothing beyond a foil for Delacourt. Everyone else in the movie is
          either a convincing nobody, or an entertaining cartoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick <em>Elysium</em> synopsis might be in order. By 2154 socialist
          insanity has long turned the world to shit, in all the ways that anyone
          with functioning sensory organs already observes happening today. A
          teeming mass of incompetent, dysgenically-processed, entropically
          poly-ethnic criminals now populate the earth, whilst the social elites
          have retreated to an orbital refuge (<em>Elysium</em>). Naturally, the
          earth is a squalid, polluted, socially-collapsed, and radically
          decivilized wasteland, whilst Elysium  is a beautiful, functional,
          productively organized achievement. So far, so obviously realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earthlings are by now so dim that they don’t even begin to
          understand why they can’t have good things too. The government of
          Elysium, in Hollywood /Silicon Valley fashion, can’t help but sympathize
          (or at least pretend to out of political expediency and social
          signalling). When Delacourt does her job, therefore, and arranges for
          Elysium-headed space barges full of “illegals” to be blasted into
          debris, the government moves to put her on a leash. As a classic
          neoreactionary, Delacourt quickly understands that defending Elysium
          will require a regime reboot. (The movie actually uses the word
          “reboot”, in a far sillier way, for the eventual triumph of the new
          Cathedral, when the very category of ‘illegality’ is erased from the
          Elysium computer systems.)
        </p>
        <p>
          By this point the film has done everything worth doing, and descends
          unreservedly into ideological slapstick. Delacourt is randomly killed by
          her own human-rights-violating special operative, in order to clear the
          last possibility of sanity out of the way. In the end, reliably
          convincing half-wit thug Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) becomes a
          stereotypical Hollywood Nu-Jesus by sacrificing himself to obliterate
          the final remaining fragment of civilization in the name of
          indiscriminate sharing. Blomkamp has by now completely lost himself in
          his own hilarity (“quite how stupid can we make this without liberals
          catching on? Actually, infinitely stupid…”). There’s no reason to get
          distracted by it here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delacourt’s question is the important one: How to maintain the last
          redoubt of social order, as a spatially-realized system of
          discrimination, when its own governing elite is fundamentally committed
          to subverting it? “Do you have children?” she asks the feckless
          president. He doesn’t even bother to reply. Responsible time-horizons
          are incompatible with his political office. So she moves forwards with
          plans for a reboot (which, of course, have to fail — the movie was 
          released and distributed wasn’t it?).
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to start printing Delacourt’s image on Tee-shirts*, or
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/elysium/#comment-15266">something</a>. Move over Darth Sidious. She’s the
          model villain for a rotten world.

          Rather than cathedrals, the East Asian cities that enthrall this blog
          tend to nurture temples to self-cultivation and ultimate cosmic nullity
          among their LED-skinned hypermodern edifices of capitalist
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/dark-techno-commercialism/">darkness</a>. Yet, despite the difference in
          religious heritage, the split-time
          signature is precisely the same. Neoreaction diverges from Paleoreaction
          insofar as it coincides with the understanding: Tradition is not
          something one can ever simply hold on to, or to which one can truly
          return. The Neoreactionary city is a standing
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/t-shirt-slogans-13/">time-spiral</a>
          in process.

          It’s pulpy and narrative-driven, of course, but that surely has its
          place. Even within its limitations it helps to hold open the question —
          from which I’m far too easily distracted —
          <em>what would an NRx aesthetic be?</em> The thematic reflexivity is a
          part of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be brutally frank, I’ve basically given up on the West as a source of
          continuing visual aesthetic achievement (<a href="http://www.ufblog.net/neotraditionalism/">symptom</a>). Its
          global influence strikes me as radically toxic, promoting
          worthless pomo garbage wherever it gets its foot in the door, and
          whenever it tries to pull-out of its death spiral — to become
          neo-traditional — it sticks Roman columns everywhere and looks simply
          ridiculous. The last person who could get away with anything like that
          was de Chirico. Probably fascism wrecked it, as it did so many other
          things. Grumpiness aside, the importance of the discussion is
          undeniable. The consolidation which matters most takes place on the
          aesthetic plane.

          <h4 class="post-title">Stock and Flow</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Some clear, sensible, <em>extremely practical</em>
          <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890">suggestions</a> on balancing
          production (<a
            href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/2013-the-year-the-stream-crested/282202/">via</a>).
          It’s a problem — tractable in principle, but tricky, and easy to get
          wrong — that a lot of people are working at right now, NRx very much
          included. I’ve not seen it stated with such conceptual elegance before
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… stock and flow is the master metaphor for media today. Here’s what
            I mean:<br />
            * Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of
            daily and sub-daily updates that remind people that you exist.<br />
            * Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as
            interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what
            people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely,
            building fans over time.<br />
            I feel like flow is ascendant these days, for obvious reasons — but we
            neglect stock at our own peril. I mean that both in terms of the
            health of an audience and, like, the health of a soul. Flow is a
            treadmill, and you can’t spend all of your time running on the
            treadmill. Well, you can. But then one day you’ll get off and look
            around and go: Oh man. I’ve got nothing here. […] But I’m not saying
            you should ignore flow …
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          NRx epitomizes the problem. It’s been through a phase of excited flow,
          but the question of stock-building is becoming unavoidable. Correct too
          hard, and the current dies altogether. Fail to correct at all, and
          nothing gets built. Every time I see someone burn out of Twitter, it
          looks to me as if the stock-flow balance problem has claimed another
          casualty. At least, that’s what I now realize I’ve been seeing.

        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/questions/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Questions</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Nydrwracu
          <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/priority-research-areas-for-reaction">wants</a>
          us to think harder, which has to be a good thing (right?). So what are
          the basic questions of neoreaction? This is too important to rush, so
          I’m inclined to go meta (which reliably slows things down).
        </p>
        <p>
          First meta point: If this is going to work, it has to be far more
          rigorously honed. That means a maximum of three basic problems each,
          with the objective of amalgamation into a list of 10, at most. The
          process of compression should do a lot of the preparatory work. Add
          Nydrwracu’s original  11 to Bryce Laliberte’s entirely different 10 ( in
          the comments, same link), and the result is already a sprawling mess
          that isn’t going anywhere. Neither list is remarkable for its tautness,
          as I hope both proposers would admit. “The 119 basic problems of
          neoreaction” isn’t going to sharpen anybody up.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, here are mine:</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-odysseus-problem/">(1)</a> The
          Odysseus Problem (or political knot theory): Can a model of distributed
          power be rigorously formulated? I am not remotely convinced that this
          question has yet been answered, and I refuse to get excited about
          monarchs until it has.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">(2)</a>
          Does a rigorous theory of degenerative ratchets capture the basic
          practical problem of neoreaction? If it does, a domain of investigation
          is determined at a high-level of abstraction. If it doesn’t, where do we
          look for degenerative ratchet counter-engineering (wherever it is, I’ll
          be spending a lot of time there).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/neoreaction-for-dummies/">(3)</a>
          What does the ‘neo-‘ in ‘neoreaction’ signify? This is a timely
          question, because I’m noticing a lot of people edging into it, and the
          topics it excavates are huge. My own take on this: Anyone who thinks
          that Modernity, Capitalism, and Progress are <em>simply</em> bad things
          to have happened should drop the ‘neo-‘ prefix immediately. After that,
          anybody who lacks conviction about needing it should think about doing
          the same. Sheer reaction is OK, isn’t it? Fashion isn’t a good reason
          for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          James Goulding also had an extremely interesting set of basic questions
          (I’m worried they’re lost somewhere on this blog). Turning them up would
          also contribute seriously to moving this forward.

          The commentary on this thread has already been so scorchingly excellent
          that it’s actually quite intimidating. (I’m blaming a brain-fogging head
          cold for not diving in more productively so far.)

          <h4 class="post-title">Neoreactionary Problems</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          I’m under a sacred obligation to review Bryce Laliberte’s ebook
          <em>What is Neoreaction? Ideology, Social-Historical Evolution, and the
            Phenomena of Civilization</em>. Thankfully, this solemn duty was not specifically scheduled. Working
          towards its accomplishment is a thought-provoking process, which is a
          good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a trivial matter, I’m forced to ask: Is that supposed to be
          ‘phenomena’? ‘Phenomenon’ would be more stylistically persuasive, even
          if the plural is defensible on conceptual grounds. That kind of
          side-issue, however, is symptomatic self-distraction. There are serious
          questions at stake here, and elusive ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          My prevarication is partly the result of
          colliding ideas, which have become entangled with the meaning of this
          book (for me), but are not really internal to its own concerns. Foremost
          among these is the connotation of the word ‘neoreaction’ itself,
          sparking an embryonic conversation (at Laliberte’s
          <a href="http://www.anarchopapist.com/2013/10/24/reaction-and-its-peripheries/">place</a>, and <a
            href="http://www.xenosystems.net/categorization/">mine</a>).
          Terminological issues can easily seem pernickety, or fetishistic, but in
          this case at least they extend continuously into matters of indisputable
          substance, and relevance. Summarily: Is ‘neoreaction’ primarily a
          doctrine or a problem? (Perhaps the question mark unfairly skews the
          trial.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In a future post I’ll get back to the specifics of Laliberte’s  extended
          definition — which is arguably coextensive with the book. It’s of
          wide-ranging interest, and connects importantly with Nick B. Steves’
          search for ‘<a href="http://nickbsteves.wordpress.com/reactionary-consensus/">reactionary consensus</a>‘
          (note:
          no
          ‘neo-‘). At this point, however, my place-holder remarks
          are themselves deliberately problematic, referring to the role of
          paradox and irony in the term, and in the ‘thing’ — elements which are
          for me essential, but which I suspect Laliberte sees as incidental, or
          even unfortunate. Neoreaction, from the problematic perspective, is
          <em>the insistence of a question</em>, rather than a solution struggling
          to be born into settled doctrine.  It is a word contrived to preserve
          its own dynamic illegibility (or unstable paradox), at least as much as
          the name for a program on the path to acceptance (arriving at consensual
          significance).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since neoreaction seems to be hurtling towards some kind of
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/a-disturbance-in-the-force/">recognition</a>, due in no small part to
          Laliberte’s contributions, these
          considerations are only <em>arcane</em> on one side of an undeveloped
          conversation. Most probably, the pace and context of this exchange will
          be set in unexpected places. Such impending unknowns inevitably guide my
          path into Laliberte’s book, as it opens, piece by piece, up ahead.

            As fission becomes the major topic of discussion the main foundation
            of that tangent becomes clear: action. This is strange as
            <strong>NRx</strong> hasn’t even begun to crack the shell of true
            analysis. <strong>Nrx</strong> has been described as a toolbox
            (especially in terms of analysis) from which individuals can pick and
            choose in order to better inform their world view. One of the major
            areas of the toolbox is the general study of learning as that is
            required in order to digest the massive amount of information
            neoreaction has uncovered as worthy sources. The
            <strong>Cathedral</strong> has failed at providing these tools and
            that seems in of itself a major focus worth investigating. My question
            to you is: ‘Are there any resources you deem relevant to the general
            topic of learning and knowledge accumulation?’ These can be as exact
            as nexialism or the <strong>Ignorant Schoolmaster</strong> or they can
            be as tangential as <strong>Non-Euclidean Politics</strong> by
            <strong>RAW</strong>. All are welcome in the general trend to get

          It shouldn’t even be difficult. Could any ‘rectification of names’ be
          more straightforward? If the word is grasped with any lucidity,
          <em>the more diversity the better</em>. Every problem that the
          (non-totalitarian) right has with ‘diversity’ is in fact a rejection of
          homogenization. To allow the prevailing pattern of usage to continue
          unchallenged is an absurdity.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Diversity’ already tilts into non-universality, and that is meta-level
          rightism itself.

          The diversity between diversity and non-diversity is the best diversity.

          The mysteries of the ideological spectrum are deep enough to absorb
          endless exploration. Why, for instance, should there be
          <em>an</em> ideological spectrum at all? Are not human disagreements
          over social decisions naturally multi-dimensional? How can opinions
          about the optimum scale of government statistically predict attitudes to
          affirmative action, immigration, gun control, drug prohibition,
          abortion, gay marriage, climate change, and foreign policy? Does it not
          seem near-magical that the seating arrangements of the late-18th century
          French National Assembly continue to organize the
          <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/100048734/scrap-the-meaningless-terms-left-and-right-and-reclaim-the-honourable-title-reactionary/"
            target="_blank">terminology</a>
          of ideological orientation up to the present day?
        </p>
        <p>
          At times, however, perplexity recedes, and certain basic patterns emerge
          with startling clarity. This is evident today in the United States – the
          world’s great circus of ideological antagonism — in the wake of its
          latest, spectacular performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As polarization intensifies – which
          <a href="http://xkcd.com/1127/large/" target="_blank">it does</a> – the
          essential is expressed through the extremes, and the alternatives are
          simplified. Which is it to be: politics or economics? There can be no
          sustainable co-existence. One must utterly eradicate the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either politics, or economics, <em>deserves</em> to be completely
          destroyed — politics for its incontinent lust for absolute power, or
          economics for its icy indifference to public concerns. The
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Visions-Ideological-Political-Struggles/dp/0465002056/ref=pd_cp_b_3"
            target="_blank">conflict of visions</a>
          is irreconcilable. From the pure perspective of terminal politics, all
          market <em>rewards</em> are arbitrary and illegitimate, whilst from that
          of economics, people are <em>entitled</em> to precisely nothing.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Talking about the election to many friends and family who had been
              rooting for Romney, I found their emotions ran the entire gamut from
              despair to despondency. Everybody was way down. I found myself
              unexpectedly blue as well. Our emotions were not so much caused by
              the Romney defeat. Few of us were particularly excited about him. It
              was the Obama victory that concerned us. … There was plenty to be
              discouraged about before this election. I’m not sure the election
              provides much new information.</em>

        <p>
          The despair of the Right is not the product of a single lamentable
          election result, but is grounded in the relentlessly gathering
          realization that it is inherently maladapted to politics. When the Right
          attains power, it is by becoming something other than itself, betraying
          its partisans not only incidentally and peripherally, through timidity
          or incompetence, but centrally and fundamentally, by practically
          advancing an agenda that almost perfectly negates its supposed
          ideological commitments. It builds that which it had promised to
          destroy, and further enthralls that which it had promised to liberate.
          Its victories mean ever less, its defeats ever more. To win is at most a
          lesser evil, whilst to lose opens new, unprecedented horizons of
          calamity, initiating previously unimagined adventures in horror.

          The left has its own frustrations, which its ever-greater approximation
          to total political dominion cannot appease, and in fact exacerbate. The
          more that it subordinates its enemies to its will, the more its will
          conforms to the image of its enemies – not the economy as it was,
          evasive and morally disinterested, but the economy as it was caricatured
          and denounced: narrowly and brutally self-interested, sublime in its
          gargantuan greed, radically corrupt, and irreparably dysfunctional. The
          cartoon plutocrat re-appears as the consummate political insider in a
          shot-silk Che Guevara tee-shirt, minutely dictating the content of
          legislation, and pursuing a career trajectory that smoothly alternates
          between the chairs of regulatory agencies and Wall Street boardrooms.
          Through a perverse, ineliminable double-entry book-keeping, the fiscal
          mountains of government largesse are registered, simultaneously, as an
          orgiastic feast of crony capitalist money creation. Public altruism and
          private avarice lock into exact logico-mathematical identity.

          The gyre turns. ‘Right’ administrations become sclerotic big government
          bureaucracies, whilst ‘Left’ administrations become the cynical public
          relations façade for rapacious banking cartels. In either case,
          government equates to treachery, executed by a party that necessarily
          abuses its own political partisans. Since politics is ever-increasingly
          the preserve of the Left, this is not an oscillator, but a
          <em>ratchet</em>, with a predictable direction (<a

          The Right, the party of the economy, is losing all credibility as a
          Party, especially to itself. In the war of annihilation that
          contemporary ideological schism has become, the substitute,
          characteristic battle-cry could be confidently anticipated, even were it
          not already so distinctly heard:
          <em>the market will avenge these offenses</em>.

          Dark Enlightenment begins with the recognition that
          <em>reality is unpopular</em>, so that the ‘natural’ course of political
          development, under democratic conditions, is reliably based upon the
          promise of an alternative. Pandering to fantasy is the only platform
          that delivers electoral support. When the dreams turn bad it is
          <em>politically obvious</em> that they have not been held firmly or
          sincerely enough, their radicalism has been insufficient, and a more
          far-reaching solution is imperative. Since either deliberate or merely

          positive feedback, and thus driven to an extreme. In its pure

          parabolic, asymptotically closing upon infinity in finite time. The
          ‘logic of history’ converges upon an absolute limit, beyond which
          further prolongation is strictly impossible. From this ultimate,
          impassable barrier, dark enlightenment retrogresses into political
          history, prophetically inflamed by its certainty of the end. Unless
          democracy disintegrates before the wall, it will hit the wall.

          “Increased repression brings increased leftism, increased leftism brings
          increased repression, in an ever tighter circle that turns ever faster.
          This is the left singularity,” Donald writes. The principal
          <em>dark</em> hypothesis is evident: on the left slope, failure is not
          self-corrective, but rather the opposite. Dysfunction deepens itself
          through the circuit of

            <em>As society moves ever leftwards, ever faster, leftists get ever
              more discontented with the outcome, but of course, the only cure for
              their discontent that it is permissible to think, is faster and
              further movement left.</em>

          It is necessary, then, to accept the leftist inversion of Clausewitz,
          and the proposition that <em>politics is war by other means</em>,
          precisely because it retains the Clausewitzean
          <em>tendency to the extreme</em> (making it ‘<a

            target="_blank">prone to escalation</a>’). This is the reason why modern political history has a
          characteristic shape, which combines a duration of escalating ‘progress’
          with a terminal, quasi-punctual interruption, or catastrophe – a
          restoration or ‘reboot’. Like mould in a Petri dish, progressive
          polities ‘develop’ explosively until all available resources have been
          consumed, but unlike slime colonies they exhibit a dynamism that is
          further exaggerated (from the exponential to the hyperbolic) by the fact
          that resource depletion accelerates the development trend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economic decay erodes productive potential and increases dependency,
          binding populations ever more desperately to the promise of political
          remedy. The progressive slope steepens towards the precipice of supreme
          radicality, or total absorption into the state … and somewhere
          fractionally before then, either before or after it has stolen
          everything you own, taken your children, unleashed mass killing, and
          descended into cannibalism, it ends.

          It can’t eat the Petri dish, or abolish reality (in reality). There is a
          limit. But humanity gets a chance to show what it’s capable of, on the
          downside. As Whiskey commented (on

          things we’d rather not know or read or hear, because they paint a
          not-so-lovely picture of human nature at its rawest.” Progress takes us
          into the raw.

          Gregory Bateson referred to cybernetic escalation as ‘schismogenesis’,
          which he identified in a number of social phenomena. Among these was
          substance
          <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Bateson.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">abuse</a>
          (specifically alcoholism), whose abstract dynamics, at the level of the
          individual, are difficult to distinguish from collective political
          radicalization. The alcoholic is captured by a schismogenetic circuit,
          and once inside, the only attractive solution is to head further in. At
          each step of life disintegration, one needs a drink more than ever.
          There goes the job, the savings, the wife and kids, and there’s nowhere
          to look for hope except the bar, the vodka bottle, and eventually that
          irresistible can of floor polish. Escape comes – if it comes before the
          morgue – in ‘hitting bottom’. Escalation to the extreme reaches the end
          of the road, or the story, where another might – possibly – begin.
          Schismogenesis predicts catastrophe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitting bottom <em>has</em> to be horrible. A long history brought you
          to this, and if this isn’t obviously, indisputably, an intolerable state
          of ultimate degradation, it will carry on. It isn’t finished until it
          <em>really can’t go on</em>, and that has to be several notches worse
          than can be anticipated. Left Singularity is deep into the dregs of the
          floor polish, with everything gone. It’s worse than anything you can
          imagine, and there’s no point at all trying to persuade people they’ve
          arrived there before they know they have. ‘Things could be better than
          this’ won’t cut it. That’s what progress is for, and progress is the

              is supposed to work, and the way it mostly did work several decades
              ago, is that the American Federal Government can only spend money on
              something if the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the
              President agree to spend money on that thing, so no government
              employee can be employed, except all three agree he should be
              employed, so the government cannot do anything unless all three
              agree that it be done. A public servant, and indeed his entire
              department, was apt to be fired if he pissed off anyone. Conversely,
              the individual was free to do anything, unless all three agree that
              he be stopped from doing that thing. We are now approaching the
              reverse situation, where for an individual to do anything requires a
              pile of permissions from diverse governmental authorities, but any
              governmental authority can spend money on anything unless there is
              near unanimous opposition to them spending money.</em>

            <em>Obviously this cannot continue. Eventually the money runs out, in
              that we shall have a hyperinflationary crisis, and revert to some
              other form of money, such as the gold standard. As that happens, the
              increasingly lawless behavior of the rulers against the ruled will
              become increasingly lawless behavior of the rulers against each
              other. Civil war, or something close to civil war, or the dire and
              immediate threat of civil war will ensue. At that point, we will
              have the political singularity, probably around 2025 or so. Beyond
              the singularity, no predictions can be made, other than that the
              results will be surprising …</em>

          Neoreactionary excitement has generated a wave of strategy discussions,
          focused upon Moldbug’s Antiversity model of organized dissident
          knowledge. The most energetic example (orchestrated by Nydwracu) can be

          Beyond curmudgeonly cynicism about youthful enthusiasm,
          <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/the-progressive-reaction/">these</a>
          concerns, and a strain of pessimism that accompanies the recognition
          that the Cathedral <em>owns</em> media like the USN owns carrier groups,
          is there any explanation for <em>Outside in</em> hanging back from all
          this, and smoking sulkily in the corner? If there’s a single term that
          accounts for our reluctance, it’s <em>cold turkey</em>.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Keynesianism is far from the only contributor to left-modernist
          degeneration, but it’s ruinous enough to account for the destruction of
          civilization on its own. The fact that it’s most realistically conceived
          as a symptom — of democratized politics, and still deeper things —
          doesn’t affect its narrative role. The important point, understood
          widely enough to be a<em> </em>cliché, is that Keynesian economics is an
          exact social analog of addiction at the level of the individual, slaved
          to what William Burroughs described as “the algebra of need.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Money is made into a drug, and the solution to the pain of craving is to
          crank up the dose. However bad it gets, if you just scale-up the fix,
          the suffering goes away. Junkies can survive for a shockingly long time.
          Perhaps there’s no end to it (that’s a question for the
          <em>Right on the Money</em> discussion).
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the morgue, if there is an end — and every venture into
          neoreactionary strategy presumes it — there’s only one form it can take:
          cold turkey. To not be in the habit anymore, it is necessary to kick it.
          That’s going to be <em>really nasty</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the level of economic structure, the ‘blue pill’ isn’t just a
          comforting illusion, it’s a massive, deeply habitual, ultra-high
          tolerance (thanks
          <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/he-just-cant-get-enough/">Spandrell</a>) <em>fix</em>, 
          radically craved down to the cellular level. Society
          has been doing this for a long time, and by now it’s mainlining crates
          of the stuff. People die of cold turkey. If not quite the worst thing in
          the world, it’s an overwhelmingly-impressive simulation of exactly that.
          Rational argument doesn’t get close to addressing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, junkies lie all the time, but the lies aren’t the basic problem.
          ‘Correcting’ the lies gets nowhere, because nobody is even really
          pretending. When the junky lies, he knows, you know, everybody knows
          that the fundamental message is simply: <em>I want more junk</em>. He’ll
          say anything that gets fractionally closer to the next fix. Hence the
          circus of democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pusher laughs at rational argument. There’s some well-meaning type
          saying: <em>seriously, think about it, this is really messed up</em>.
          Then there’s the ‘pusher’ — which is already a joke — because people are
          crawling  to him on their knees. He doesn’t need to say anything. One
          more hit and the pain goes away for a while. That’s what matters. The
          rest is merely ‘superstructural’ (to go Right-wing Marxist on the
          topic).
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no way, ever, that from this deep in, one gets out before
          hitting bottom. The slide has to reach the limit, because short of that,
          the prospect of anesthesia trumps everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Western Civilization is a sick junky. It isn’t going to be argued out of
          its habit. First, it has to taste the floor. That’s just the way it is —

        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">
          <h4 class="post-title">The Idea of Neoreaction</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          To translate ‘neoreaction’ into ‘the new reaction’ is in no way
          objectionable.  It is new, and open to novelty. Apprehended
          historically, it dates back no more than a few years. The writings of
          Mencius Moldbug have been a critical catalyst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neoreaction is also a species of reactionary political analysis,
          inheriting a deep suspicion of ‘progress’ in its ideological usage. It
          accepts that the dominant sociopolitical order of the world has
          ‘progressed’ solely on the condition that such <em>advance</em>, or
          relentless forward movement, is entirely stripped of moral endorsement,
          and is in fact bound to a primary association with <em>worsening</em>.
          The model is that of a progressive disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ‘neo-‘ of neoreaction is more than just a
          chronological marker, however. It introduces a distinctive idea, or
          abstract topic: that of a <em>degenerative ratchet</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impulse to back out of something is already reactionary, but it is
          the combination of a critique of progress with a recognition that
          <em>simple reversal is impossible</em> that initiates neoreaction. In
          this respect, neoreaction is a specific discovery of the arrow of time,
          within the field of political philosophy. It learns, and then teaches,
          that the way to get out cannot be the way we got in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wherever progressivism takes hold, a degenerative ratchet is set to
          work. It is unthinkable that any society could <em>back out</em> of the
          expansive franchise, the welfare state, macroeconomic policy-making,
          massively-extended regulatory bureaucracy, coercive-egalitarian secular
          religion, or entrenched globalist intervention. Each of these
          (inter-related) things are essentially irreversible. They give modern
          history a <em>gradient</em>. Given any two historical ‘snap-shots’, one
          can tell immediately which is earlier and which later, by simply
          observing the extent to which any of these social factors have
          <em>progressed</em>. Leviathan does not shrink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the theory of complex systems, certain phase transitions exhibit
          comparable properties. Network effects can <em>lock-in</em> changes,
          which are then irreversible. The adoption and consolidation of  the
          Qwerty keyboard exemplifies this pattern. Technological businesses
          commonly make lock-in central to their strategies, and if they succeed,
          they cannot then die in the same way they matured.
        </p>
        <p>
          When neoreaction identifies a degenerative ratchet — such as the (Jim
          Donald) Left Singularity — it necessarily poses the problem of a novel
          end. The process goes wrong consistently, and irreversibly. To repeat
          the Neoreactionary Idea as a mantra:

          A degenerative ratchet can only progress, until it cannot go on, and it
          stops. What happens next is something else — its Outside. Moldbug calls
          it a <em>reboot</em>.  History can tell us to expect it, but not what we
          are to expect.

            Portugal, Spain, the rest of insolvent social-democratic Europe —
            and now Detroit — is the time for conservatives to raise the banner of
            Stein’s Law and yell, “Stop.” You can kick the can down the road, but
            at some point it disappears over a cliff.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, yes, yes … but. Despite its perfect common sense, the monotony of
          this message is becoming utterly unbearable. The end isn’t arriving
          tomorrow. This dreary horror show could last for
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/collapse-schedules/">decades</a>.
          How many roughly-identical, absolutely obvious, sensible Op Ed columns
          is it possible to endure? (I’m already way into overtime.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A reasonable conclusion from the reality of
          degenerative ratchets is that nothing less than a comprehensive
          <a href="http://blog.jim.com/war/preparing-for-civil-war-two.html">crash</a>
          makes them stop. Some of the healthier Right-delight over the Detroit
          implosion is tied to the expectation that bad examples could be
          educational, but the evidence for that is slender, especially under
          conditions of sovereign propaganda saturation (the Cathedral). Who are
          you going to trust, the academic-media complex or your lying eyes? We
          already know the predominant answer to that question.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a message is existentially unacceptable to the Cathedral, it will
          not be heard, and the only messages with substantial reality content are
          of exactly this kind. True believers will stick with a morbid utopia to
          the end, since anything truly different would — in any case — count for
          them as some species of death. For cynics, the calculation is even
          easier: why unnecessarily shorten looting time? More common still are
          the poor idiots, who will just do what they’re told (while trying to
          grab a little feeding trough time), and then be sacrificed. It should
          already be clear that <em>nobody cares about them</em>, and they’re too
          defective to care competently for themselves. That’s neither justice nor
          injustice, but simple reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody here is under any illusions about the profound socio-political
          malignancy given free reign in Detroit, or about the quality of human
          material over which it held sway, and yet it lasted up to a point that
          has provoked repeated comparisons with Hiroshima-1945, wrung out to the
          ugly end (and we haven’t yet seen the end). If we ever doubted that
          <em>there’s a lot of ruin in a nation</em>, we no longer can. For a city
          uniquely proficient at suicide, the process lasts half a century,
          including final, grinding decades, when nothing beyond a zombie parody
          of what once was still remains. If a uniquely benighted social trash
          pile can last this long, how far can the world’s most powerful nation
          spin out its decline? There’s enough time, to be sure, for an Amazon
          jungle worth of Herbert Stein-inspired Op Eds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can-kicking eventually runs out of road, <em>of course</em>, and its
          only when this truism has become an intolerable, deadening drone that
          neoreaction begins. Anybody who still needs to hear that message
          <em>is simply lost</em>. Remedial education cannot be the neoreactionary
          task (there are libertarian-oriented conservatives for that — and they
          will fail).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Dark Enlightenment cannot end with Stein’s conclusion, but is
          rather initiated by it, born from the presupposition that
          <em>this cannot go on forever</em>, how is its guiding topic to be
          understood? What will it discuss — with what will it occupy itself —
          amid the deepening ruin, <em>for decades</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
          As its name indicates, Dark Enlightenment is a creature of late
          twilight, preparing for a gruesomely protracted night. One object that
          merits growing fascination is certainly this:
          <em>the ruin reservoir is deep</em>. As a fact this is easily — and for
          neoreaction <em>necessarily</em> — acknowledged, but the exploration of
          its mysteries has still scarcely begun.

        </a>
        <p>
          David Stockman rests his analysis of recent economic history upon one
          basic presupposition, whose modesty is expressed by an intrinsic
          inclination to a negative form:
          <em>Radical dishonesty cannot provide a foundation for enduring financial
            value</em>. This assumption suffices to expose the otherwise scarcely
          comprehensible rottenness of American public affairs, to organize an
          integral understanding of the gathering calamity, and to marginalize his
          work as the over-excited howl of a lonely crank.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any society where minimal standards of civil decency were still even
          tenuously remembered, his ideas would be simple common sense. In the
          bedlamite orgy we in fact inhabit, Stockman’s thoughts appear wildly
          counter-intuitive, rigidly structured by uninterpretable imperatives,
          and suffused by an improbable aura of doom. In fact Stockman is quite
          clear — implicitly — that under American political conditions
          <em>sanity was strictly unobtainable</em>. The coming calamity fulfills
          a (bi-partisan) democratic destiny — but that is to anticipate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stockman’s
          <a
            href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-10-05/david-stockman-explains-keynesian-state-wreck-ahead-sundown-america">latest</a>
          compressed overview of our contemporary crisis — generated by
          the accelerated demolition of economic civilization over the last
          quarter-century —  explains the “Sundown in America” — “a dystopic ‘new
          normal’ where historic notions of perpetual progress and robust economic
          growth no longer pertain.” It outlines a vision that supports a
          theoretical bet, or short speculation on the economic infrastructure of
          the Cathedral: “Now the American state — the agency which was supposed
          to save capitalism from its inherent flaws and imperfections — careens
          wildly into dysfunction and incoherence. […] Washington’s machinery of
          national governance is literally melting-down. It is the victim of 80
          years of Keynesian error — much of it nurtured in the environs of
          Harvard Yard — about the nature of the business cycle and the capacity
          of the state — especially its central banking branch — to ameliorate the
          alleged imperfections of free market capitalism.” The enemy will never
          again have a record of effective economic performance to legitimate
          itself through. What it is doing — and has to do — however politically
          efficacious, is locked tightly into an inescapable vector that can lead
          nowhere except utter financial ruin. (Neoreaction should bifurcate on
          this point, because adaptation to an alternative possibility is
          something so completely different, very little of strategic substance
          will translate across.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Stockman is able to draw upon his own biography to reveal where the GOP
          went wrong — the political necessities of democratic acceptance drove
          economic policy into the abyss:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… the circumstances of my own ex-communication from the supply-side
            church underscore the Reaganite embrace of the Keynesian gospel. The
            true-believers — led by Art Laffer, an economist with a Magic Napkin,
            and Jude Wanniski, an ex-Wall Street Journal agit-prop man who chanced
            to stuff said napkin into his pocket — were militantly opposed to
            spending cuts designed to offset the revenue loss from the Reagan tax
            reductions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>They called this “root canal” economics and insisted that the
            Republican Party could never compete with the Keynesian Democrats
            unless it abandoned its historic commitment to balanced budgets and
            fiscal rectitude, and instead, campaigned on tax cuts everywhere and
            always and a fiscal free lunch owing to a purported cornucopia of
            economic growth.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Winning elections was conditional upon fiscal barbarism, given only the
          quite reasonable assumption that nothing except radical dishonesty could
          ever be popular. Insane promises, short-termism, and whole-hearted
          participation in a bi-partisan conspiracy to eradicate the last vestiges
          of responsible government were indispensable steps towards the exercise
          of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The fiscal end game — policy paralysis and the eventual bankruptcy of
            the state — thus became visible. All of the beltway players
            –Republican, Democrats and central bankers alike — are now so hooked
            on the Keynesian cool-aid that they cannot imagine the Main Street
            economy standing on its own two feet without continuous, massive
            injections of state largesse. […] the stimulus bill was not a rational
            economic plan at all; it was a spasmodic eruption of beltway larceny
            that has now become our standard form of governance.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hence the Stockman forecast:</p>
        <p>
          <em>… the Federal budget has become a doomsday machine because the
            processes of fiscal governance are paralyzed and broken. There will be
            recurrent debt ceiling and shutdown crises like the carnage scheduled
            for next week, as far as the eye can see.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Indeed, notwithstanding the assurances of debt deniers like professor
            Krugman, the honest structural deficit is $1-2 trillion annually for
            the next decade and then it will get far worse. In fact, when you set
            aside the Rosy Scenario used by CBO and its preposterous Keynesian
            assumption that we will reach full employment in 2017 and never fall
            short of potential GDP ever again for all eternity, the fiscal
            equation is irremediable.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Under these conditions what remains of our free enterprise economy
            will … buckle under the weight of taxes and crisis. Sundown in America
            is well-nigh unavoidable.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the terrain that neoreaction takes root within. It frames our
          problems, opportunities, and expectations. The overwhelmingly
          preponderant part of our intellectual energies should be targeted at the
          future it anticipates.

        <p>
          This point is important enough to restate well, as Foseti
          <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/an-anti-reaction-faq/">does</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The crux of [<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">Scott
              Alexander’s</a>] argument is that, “It is a staple of Reactionary thought that
            everything is getting gradually worse.” He then goes on to show that
            not everything is getting worse. […] It is not a staple of reactionary
            thought that everything is getting worse. To the contrary, I’ve never
            read that argument from any reactionary anywhere. […] Let’s correct
            his statement: It is a staple of Reactionary thought that massive
            improvements in technology have been very effective in masking massive
            declines in virtually all other aspects of society.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The progressive assumption, which neoreaction contests, is that it is
          natural and good to spend the advances of civilization on causes
          unrelated to civilizational advance. A more controversial formulation
          (supported here) is that the Cathedral spends capitalism on something
          other than capitalism, and ultimately on the destruction of capitalism.
          It tolerates a functional economy — to the extent that it does — only on
          the understanding that it will be used for something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elementary cybernetics predicts that if productivity is recycled into
          productivity, the outcome is an explosive process of increasing returns.
          Insofar as history is not manifesting accelerating productivity,
          therefore, it can be assumed that social circuitry is being fed through
          non-productive, and anti-productive links. Techno-commercial Modernity
          is being squandered on (Neo-Puritan) Progressivism. In the West, at
          least, that is what is <em>getting worse</em>.

        <p>
          Neoreaction, at its core, is a critical analysis of the Cathedral. It
          should surprise nobody, therefore, to see it hurtled into public
          consciousness, as the sole cultural agency able to name the self-evident
          configuration of contemporary sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Cathedral becomes a self-confident public performance, its only
          remotely-articulate analyst is drawn into prominence, in its wake. In
          this regard, we haven’t seen anything yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even had the Obama administration consciously decided to select the
          Cathedral as a branding device, it could not have been epitomized any
          more perfectly. Sacralized progressivism, ivory tower ‘brahminism’,
          academic-media fusion as the exclusive source of recognizable authority,
          and the absolute identification of governance with public relations have
          reached a zenith that tilts into self-parody. Soft fascist
          self-transcending hyper-Calvinism has been lucidly distilled into
          blitz-promoted political iconography. Everyone with a television set now
          knows that the Cathedral is in power, and merely await the
          terminological confirmation of their perceptions. Enthusiasts and
          dissidents are seeing more-or-less the same thing, characterized in
          approximately the same words. The only serious matter of controversy is
          the quantity of spiritual devotion such a regime, faith, and symbolic
          order reasonably commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Politics-as-religious-experience has been seen in America before.
          Arguably, it is even typical. What has not been seen since William
          Jennings Bryan at the dawn of the progressive movement, and never at all
          before then, is democracy pitched to such rapturous extremities of
          soteriological expectation — and Bryan was stopped. By identifying
          himself deliberately with a promise of comprehensive socio-spiritual
          redemption, Obama has more fully exemplified <em>hubris</em> than any
          leader in the history of the United States. The appropriate frame of
          political explanation, therefore, is <em>tragic</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tragedy is the fundamental teaching of
          Classical Occidental Antiquity, nucleated upon the insight that
          <em>hubris escalates to nemesis</em>. It finds its most lucid
          philosophical articulation in the fragment of Anaximander:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Whence things originate,</em><br />
          <em> Thence they return to destruction,</em><br />
          <em> According to necessity;</em><br />
          <em> For they reciprocate justice and pay recompense</em><br />
          <em> For their injustice</em><br />
          <em> In conformity with the ordinance of Time</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conception strongly resonates with neoreactionary fatalism
          (anti-politics), and with the formation of ideas around
          <em>wu wei</em> (laissez faire) in the Chinese cultural context.
          Nemesis, the agency of cosmic justice (<em>Δίκη</em>) eventuates
          automatically, as a retarded consequence that is nevertheless
          inalienably bound to the <em>hubris</em> of political action. The fatal
          stroke is delivered — at the right time — from the intersection of power
          and fate, rather than by any kind of considered remedy or political
          dialectic. Tragic rectification completes itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is a ‘strategic’ lesson from tragedy, it is not opposition, but
          <em>non-participation</em>.  To become entangled in hubris is to invite
          nemesis. To the greatest extent possible, hubristic power should be left
          to its fate. The less interrupted its acceleration into concentrated
          nemesis, the more spectacularly cosmic justice is displayed, and the
          more effectively the audience is educated.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re sitting comfortably, you can pass around the popcorn now,
          because the American tragedy is a real doozy. We already know that Obama
          is playing the part of the tragic hero with exceptional genius, as the
          very personification of immoderate political ambition and narcissistic
          blindness. Far more unexpectedly, his GOP opposition has somehow reached
          beyond its corrupt dementia to discover the fatal stance of
          non-participation, unanimously rejecting the President’s key-stone
          domestic initiative, and also distancing itself from his foreign policy
          agenda in overwhelming numbers. Unilateral Cathedralism reigns,
          uncompromised. This is the secret to the unprecedented delights of the
          current epoch.

          the spectacle well:
        </p>
        <p>
          I<em>f you can’t take some joy, some modicum of relief and mirth, in the
            unprecedentedly spectacular beclowning of the president, his
            administration, its enablers, and, to no small degree, liberalism
            itself, then you need to ask yourself why you’re following politics in
            the first place. Because, frankly, this has been one of the most
            enjoyable political moments of my lifetime. I wake up in the morning
            and rush to find my just-delivered newspaper with a joyful expectation
            of worsening news so intense, I feel like Morgan Freeman should be
            narrating my trek to the front lawn. Indeed, not since Dan Rather
            handcuffed himself to a fraudulent typewriter, hurled it into the
            abyss, and saw his career plummet like Ted Kennedy was behind the
            wheel have I enjoyed a story more.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Alas, the English language is not well equipped to capture the
            sensation I’m describing, which is why we must all thank the Germans
            for giving us the term “schadenfreude” — the joy one feels at the
            misfortune or failure of others. The primary wellspring of
            schadenfreude can be attributed to Barack Obama’s hubris — another
            immigrant word, which means a sinful pride or arrogance that causes
            someone to believe he has a godlike immunity to the rules of life.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The catharsis is so harsh and pure that even the invertebrate
          Buckleyites at <em>The National Review</em> are beginning to get it, for
          a short, exquisite moment, at least. As Konkvistador warns (in
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-wasteland/">this</a> thread), a
          far less radically degraded group of people will nevertheless “forget
          all about these insights [as] the next election cycle warms up, indeed
          elections with their promise of power for conservatives and
          pseudo-conservatives [have] historically served as their mindwipe.
          Election cycles are when conservative obsolete Progressivism is updated
          to a slightly less obsolete version.” The sojourn of conservatism on the
          Outer Right, where tragic non-participation holds, cannot be expected to
          last. Yet even as a brief intermission from vile ambition, it allows
          nemesis the space to express itself in its full, planet-shuddering
          splendor.

          Whatever the disagreements and divergences among the strands of
          neoreaction, there is one message that has to remain unwaveringly
          consistent: <em>The Cathedral owns this</em> (totally). Less than a
          quarter of the way into Obama’s second term, full-spectrum catastrophe
          is already written across the heavens in letters of incandescent sulfur.
          Obamacare is wrecked before it has even rolled out, Yellen has all-but
          promised to dedicate the Fed to full-throttle bubble-mania, metropolitan
          bankruptcy is burning through the nation’s cities like a zombie virus,
          crime is angling sharply upwards, American foreign policy lies in
          smoking ruins … there is simply no way this disintegrating jalopy holds
          together for another three years.
        </p>
        <p>Let in burn — in the Cathedral’s hands.</p>

          It follows from the analysis of socio-political modernity
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">as</a> a
          <em>degenerative ratchet</em> that
          <em>identification of deterioration does not in itself amount to a
            program for reversing it</em>. The vividness of this problem is directly proportional to the
          seriousness with which the nature of time, as a practical consideration,
          is addressed. The <em>essential</em> difference between reaction and
          neoreaction is adequately articulated as soon as this point is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Past orientation’ is an impressively defensible value (even by
          techno-commercial
          <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0095209">criteria</a>).
          Retro-directed
          action, in contrast, is sheer error. This is too
          obvious an idea to labor over. Those who do not get it have chosen not
          to.

        <p>
          Unlike the many unsettled controversies of neoreaction, the temptation
          to <em>simply return</em>, however well-intentioned, merits no more than
          condescension. In this case — as in so many others — an image is worth a

          <a href="http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2014/07/02/the-danger-of-symmetry/#more-37851">makes</a>
          a basic, but essential point:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mention repealing Obamacare and you are told it is impossible; even
            John Boehner said, it’s the ‘law of the land’. Brown vs Board is the
            law of the land, Roe vs Wade is the law of the land, but Hobby Lobby
            or Citizens United is an abomination to be repealed or ignored
            soonest. It’s like a ratchet. It moves only in the way of the approved
            narrative.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same insight
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">identified</a>
          by this blog as <em>The Idea of Neoreaction</em>, which is to say:
          recognition of a degenerative ratchet as the central mechanism of
          ‘progress’ (to the Left). Fernandez draws explicit attention to its
          constitutive asymmetry. Partisan polarity is revealed as a one-way
          conveyor, alternating between ‘stop’ and ‘go left’. Two-party democratic
          politics is structurally-established as an inevitable loser’s game for
          the Right. Once this is seen, how is the thought of ‘conservative
          activism’ in any way sustainable, except as a transparently futile joke?
          Hasn’t the line already been crossed to the dark side?
        </p>
        <p>Fernandez is still hedging:</p>
        <p>
          <em>… the real news is this: it’s not working any more. Even Obamacare
            might actually be repealed. Liberal foreign policy might really go
            down in flames. Already the authorities are warning of bombs on
            inbound airline flights. And Obama might actually be the worst
            president since World War 2. Things used to be under control; what
            happened? […] History suggests that over time all conflict becomes
            symmetrical.  Eventually both sides become equally brutal. […] If
            there is any lesson taught by history it is that man when driven far
            enough is the most dangerous and merciless life form on the
            planet.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not at all clear to me what’s really being said here. Is this an
          anticipation of counter-revolution? Or is it merely the tired claim that
          <em>the next election could really make a difference</em>?
          <em><br /> </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in the most depressing case, something is being seen that would
          very much rather not be seen. If acute conservative opinion is tiring of
          its role as the Cathedral’s loyal opposition, it indicates that the
          mechanism is beginning to break down.

          Perhaps all significant ideological distinctions — at the level of
          philosophical abstraction — can be derived from this proposition. For
          the progressive, it represents the purest expression of history’s “moral

          For the Conservative (or, more desperately, the Reactionary), it
          describes an unfolding historical catastrophe. For the Neoreactionary,
          it indicates a problem in need of theorization. Moldbug lays out the
          problem in this (now classic)

            In the history of American democracy, if you take the mainstream
            political position (Overton Window, if you care) at time T1, and place
            it on the map at a later time T2, T1 is always way to the right, near
            the fringe or outside it. So, for instance, if you take the average
            segregationist voter of 1963 and let him vote in the 2008 election, he
            will be way out on the wacky right wing. Cthulhu has passed him by.

          The specific Moldbuggian solution to this problem, whether approached
          historically through the Ultra-Calvinism Thesis, or systemically through
          the analysis of the Cathedral, invokes a dynamic model of Occidental
          religious modernization. The irreversible bifurcations, symmetry breaks,
          or schisms that lock Western modernity into its “great leftward shift”
          correspond to successive episodes of cladistic fission within Protestant
          Christianity (abstractly understood). The religious history of modernity
          is constituted by a <em>degenerative ratchet</em> (as touched upon here,

          <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-08-27/no-easy-exit-from-the-euro">converges</a>
          upon the same insight. She writes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>As a longtime euroskeptic, who has frequently flirted with the idea
            that the euro must eventually destroy itself, I am sympathetic to
            Humphreys’ point. But let me attempt to offer a partial defense of the
            hapless eurocrats: However stupid the creation of the euro was,
            undoing it will not be easy. […] Yes, we’re back to our old friend
            path dependence. As
            <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-08-21/legalize-drugs-deal-with-the-downsides">I
              noted</a>
            the other day, the fact that you can avoid some sort of terrible fate
            by stopping something before it starts does not mean that you can
            later achieve the same salutary effects by ceasing whatever stupid
            thing you have done. It would have been painless just to not have the
            euro. But it will be painful indeed to get rid of it.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          She encounters the signature nonlinearities of such lock-in phenomena in
          noting: “No wonder that no one wants even to discuss it. Especially
          since even discussing a dissolution of the euro area makes a crisis more
          likely …”
        </p>
        <p>
          Progressivism as a process, rather than a mere attitude, is always and
          everywhere a matter of degenerative ratchets. Consider, very briefly,
          some of the most prominent examples:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Democratization. Every extension of the franchise is effectively
          irreversible. This is why the promotion of democratic reform in Hong
          Kong, in a complete rupture from its local traditions, is so
          breathtakingly irresponsible. (No link, because I have yet to encounter
          an article on the subject worthy of recommendation.)
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Welfare systems (and positive rights in general). The
          irreversibility of these socio-economic innovations is widely
          recognized. Once implemented, they cannot be rolled back without the
          infliction of massive suffering. Obamacare is a more-or-less cynical
          attempt to exploit this lock-in dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Immigration. Welcoming newcomers is effortless, removing them
          all-but impossible (or at least entirely unprecedented in the modern
          West). Immigration policy, by its nature, can only “swim left”. It
          consists of freezes and floods (but never reversals) — epitomizing the
          ratchet pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Macroeconomic politicized money (central banking, fiat currency,
          inflationary normalization, and debt financing). Easing is easy,
          tightening is terrifying, roll back unattempted (since Jackson in the
          mid-19th century).
        </p>
        <p>
          My contention:
          <em>There is no substantial topic of Neoreactionary concern that does not
            conform to this basic pattern</em>. The degenerative ratchet is <em>the problem</em>, abstractly
          conceived.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why NRx is dark. The only way out of a degenerative ratchet is
          catastrophe. Such processes are essentially unreformable, and this
          conclusion captures the critique of political conservatism from which
          NRx has been born. The only non-disastrous solution to a DR, or
          progressive lock-in dynamic, is to avoid entering into it. Once it has
          begun, normal politics can only modulate the speed of deterioration, and
          then only to a relatively limited degree. It will reach its end, which
          will be seriously horrible. NRx forecasting begins and ends with this
          thesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our doomsterism is not a psychological tic, but a rigorous theoretical
          obligation. It follows, ineluctably, from iron historical law. Looking

          The Outer-Right, in all its principal strands, has a horrified
          fascination with decline. Is this basic proposition even slightly
          controversial? It’s not easy to see how it could be. This is a zone of
          convergence of such intimidating enormity that even beginning to heap up
          link support seems futile. Taking the Trichotomy as a rough guide
          reveals the pattern starkly:<br />
          (1) Religious traditionalists see a continuous decline trend from the
          Reformation to the most recent frenzy of evangelical
          hyper-secularism.<br />
          (2) Ethno-Nationalists see a process of accelerating demographic
          destruction driven — or at least lucidly articulated — by left-wing race
          politics.<br />
          (3) Techno-Commercialists see the systematic destruction of capital by
          cancerous Leviathan and macroeconomic high-fraudulence, undermining
          economic incentives, crushing time-horizons, and garbling
          price-discovery into fiat noise.<br />
          In each case, the online-ecologies (and associated micro-cultures)
          sharing the respective deep intuitions of progressive ruin are too
          enormous to conveniently apprehend. What everyone on the Outer-Right
          shares (and I’m now hardening this up, into a definition) is the
          adamantine confidence that the basic socio-political process is
          radically morbid, and is leading inexorably to utter ruin.
        </p>

          No surprise, then, that John Michael Greer finds many attentive readers
          in our camp. His latest (and still incomplete) series on
          <em>Dark Age America</em> resonates with particular strength. The most
          recent
          <a
            href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/2014/11/dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html">installment</a>,
          which discusses the impending collapse of the market system, through
          quasi-Marxist crisis, on its way to many centuries of neo-feudalism, is
          bound to raise some tech-comm eyebrows, but it nevertheless occupies the
          same broad forecast space. If people are stocking their basements with
          ammo, silver coins, and dried beans for Greer reasons rather than
          <a
            href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-10/train-wreck-coming-david-stockman-warns-all-hell-will-break-loose">Stockman</a>
          ones, they might cut back a little on the coins, but they’re not going
          to stop stocking the basement. Differences seem to lie in the details.
        </p>
        <p>
          The differences in the details are actually
          fairly substantial. Even if <em>Winter is coming</em>, we’re not
          necessarily talking about the same thing. To begin with, Greer is not a
          figure of the Outer-Right at all, because his (extremely interesting)
          cybernetic engine of descent is ecological and resource-based, carried
          by a deep eco-historical ‘correction’ or dominating (negative) feedback
          cycle whose proxy is fossil-fuel abundance. Modernity, roughly speaking,
          simply runs out of gas. His cultural criticism is ultimately anchored in
          — and limited to — that. When describing (drawn-out, and incremental)
          civilizational collapse, he forecasts the automatic nemesis of a system
          doomed by its unsustainable excess. Further engagement with this model
          belongs elsewhere. It’s an important discussion to have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more immediate concern, here, is with the very different components
          of ‘winter’ — of which three, in particular, stand-out. Each is, in
          itself, huge. The directions in which they point, however, are not
          obviously coherent.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Closest to the Greer vision are bad global-systems dynamics. These
          tend to prevail on the Outer-Right, but they typically lack the
          theoretical resolution Greer provides. It is understandable that those
          who strongly identify with specific declining ethnies (or Super-Phyles),
          whether theologically, racially, or traditionally conceived, are
          disinclined to distinguish their progressive dilapidation from a
          generalized global calamity. This is certainly
          <a href="http://thosewhocansee.blogspot.com/2014/11/theres-something-about-teutonics.html">not</a>
          merely stupid, however much it offends prevailing moral fashion. The
          extent to which it supplies an adequate preparation for the events to
          come is questionable, nevertheless. Without an explicit defense of its
          specificity, it can all too easily confuse its <em>own</em> winter
          sicknesses with a universal predicament.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) What can easily be under-estimated is the localization of the
          unfolding disaster, in a specifically Occidental collapse. This is, of
          course, Spengler’s <em>Decline of the West</em>, among other things, and
          even though this is a work Greer explicitly acknowledges, the inherent
          globality of his model tends to eclipse its particularism. For Greer,
          the impending decline of China (for instance) follows upon its
          complicity in fossil-fueled industrial modernity, even if, for
          rhetorical effect, it is to be permitted a few decades of comparative
          ascendancy. The Outer-Right tends to be Greerian in this respect,
          although without equivalent positive reason. It is not asked, often
          enough, how much of the deepening winter is — quite narrowly —
          <em>ours</em>. Greer has an argument for why Western Modernity has
          consumed the future for everyone. Unless the fundamentals of this theory
          are accepted, is there any reason to accept its predictive consequences?
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The third ‘winter’ is modeled by the rhythmic troughs of the
          Kondratiev cycle. This tends to localize in time, rather than space,
          dividing the merely seasonal from the cumulative, secular trend. While a
          comprehensive attribution of our malaise to such a cycle would
          constitute an exit from the Outer-Right, passing into a far more
          complacent diagnosis of the global, or merely Western, calamity, to
          dismiss it entirely from consideration is to court profound cognitive
          (and predictive) imbalance. In the opinion of this blog, Greer’s model
          is grievously afflicted by such imbalance, and — once again — this seems
          to be a syndrome of far wider prevalence. Scarcely anybody on the
          Outer-Right is prepared for rhythmic amelioration of significant modern
          pathologies, through renewal of techno-commercial vitality
          <em>even under conditions of secular civilizational decline</em>. Yet
          even glancing attention to the working of the (~ half century)
          <em>long waves</em> suggests that such neglect is simply unrealistic.
          Unless the K-wave is now dead — an extraordinarily extreme proposition,
          which surely merits explicit assertion — some proportion of the present
          decay is inherently transitional. New industrial structures based on
          blockchained communications — and thus designed to route around
          socio-cultural sclerosis — will support an explosion of innovation
          dwarfing any yet imagined (including synthetic economic agents, quantum
          computing, neuromorphic chips, large-scale space activity, applied
          genomics, VR media systems, drone-robotics, commercialized security …
          maybe
          <em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8578151">Urbit</a></em>). Even if Greer is absolutely right
          about the deep historical pattern
          being played out — and I’m fully confident he isn’t — the next K-wave
          upswing is going to be vast, dazzling, and, almost incomprehensibly
          distracting. There’s perhaps a decade remaining in which uncompromising
          gloom-core will make sense, after which the Outer-Right risks utter
          eclipse during two decades of upswing euphoria. It would make a lot of
          sense to pre-adapt to it, beginning with a reminder that the Outer-Right
          case is <strong>not</strong> that <em>everything</em> will
          <em>continually</em> deteriorate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve run out the clock on myself for now … but I’ll get back to this.

        Foseti, commenting at his own place,
        <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/randoms-112/">asks</a>
        rhetorically:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don’t you think that writing to save the world is – in itself –
          fundamentally progressive in nature (not to say wildly
          presumptuous)?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even those tempted to answer in the negative need to think this through
        patiently, because the pretensions this question punctures are typically
        distinguished by their thoughtlessness. Modern politics became psychotic
        when agitated scribblers convinced themselves that they had the tools,
        the right, and even the <em>duty</em> to re-order the world in
        accordance with their pamphlets. This is a Left tradition that few have
        yet derided enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        To carve out cognitive independence is one thing, to deform it into
        practical idealism is quite another. Indeed, dripping our dark poisons
        into the milk of idealism might easily be the most
        <em>practical</em> difference we can make. Soaring words and rallying
        cries have already done far too much. It makes sense to take a step
        back, into skepticism, humor, undistorted proportion, and the
        hypothetical mode, before advancing further down our tracks … wherever
        they lead.

      <h4 class="post-title">Neoreactionary Realism</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        The easiest place to start is with what neoreactionary realism isn’t,
        which is
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/specifying-a-neoreactionary-research-agenda/">this</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          For a reactionary state to be established in the West in our
          lifetimes, we’ll need to articulate the need for one in a language
          millions of people can understand. If not to produce nationalists, to
          at least produce a large contingent of sympathizers. The
          question,<strong>
            “What is it, exactly, that you propose to do?”</strong>
          must be answered, first in simple terms, then in detailed terms that
          directly support the simple arguments. The urge to develop esoteric
          theories of causes and circumstances should be tossed aside, and
          replaced with concrete proposals for a novel form of government that
          harmonizes with perennial principles. This can be achieved by
          producing positive theories for a new order, rather than analyzing the
          nuts and bolts of a decaying order.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with a model of an ideal society is
        a procedure that already has a name, and a different one: Utopianism.
        It’s not a difficult way to think. For instance, imagine a political
        regime based on
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-unraveling/">commutative tax politics</a>. As far as economic
        considerations are concerned, the political
        problem is solved. Policy choices are aligned with practical incentives,
        and the manifestly irresistible democratic impulse to redistributive
        violation of property rights is immediately terminated. The trouble with
        this idea? — There’s no practical way to get to it. The real problem of
        political philosophy does not lie in the conceptual effort of modeling
        an ideal society, but in <em>departing from where we are,</em> in a
        direction that tends to the optimization of a selected value (equality
        stinks, utility doesn’t work, freedom is OK, intelligence is best).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where can we get to from here? </em>Unless this question controls
        political theory, the result is utopian irrelevance. The initial
        <em>real</em> problem is escape. In consequence, two broad avenues of
        realistic neoreactionary reflection are open:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Elaborate escape. This topic naturally bifurcates in turn, into the
        identification and investment of exit-based institutions, and the
        promotion of secessionist options (from fissional
        <a href="http://freestateproject.org/">federalism</a> to
        <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/">seasteading</a>). An escape-based
        society, unlike a utopia, is structured in the same way it is reached.
        Upon arriving in a world made of the right sort of fragments —
        splintered by political philosophy rather than tribal variety — all
        kinds of real possibilities arise. (Tribes are a useless distraction,
        because they resonate to defective philosophies — a world of Benetton
        differentiated failing social democracies is the one we are being herded
        into now.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Defend diversity. Once again, ethnic diversity — as such — means
        next to nothing (at best). Every ‘people’ has shown itself capable of
        political idiocy. What deserves preservation is fracture, defined over
        against Cathedral universalism. Any place that can practically count as
        ‘offshore’ is a base for the future. In particular, the East Asian
        antidemocratic technocapitalist tradition merits ferocious ideological
        defense against Cathedralist subversion. Within the West, domestic
        enclaves that have resisted macrosocial absorption — from Amish
        communities to survivalist militia movements — have comparable value.
        Wherever political globalism fails, neoreaction wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The very last thing neoreaction has to usefully declare is
        <em>I have a dream</em>. Dream-mongering is the enemy. The only future
        worth striving for is splintered into myriads, loosely webbed together
        by free-exit connections, and conducting innumerable experiments in
        government, the vast majority of which will fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not, and cannot, know what we want, anymore than we can know what
        the machines of the next century will be like, because
        <em>real potentials need to be discovered</em>, not imagined. Realism is
        the negative of an unfounded pretense to knowledge, no less in political
        sociology than information technology.  Invention is not planning, and
        sky-castles offer no refuge from the Cathedral. If there’s one thing we
        need to have learned, and never to forget, it’s that.

      <p>
        Gloom and realism can be hard to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Doomed:_Reclaiming_Conservative_Pessimism">distinguish</a>, but
        it’s
        important to carry on. Curmudgeonry without stubbornness
        isn’t worth a damn. Even in the worst case, relentless, sluggishly
        deterioriating ghastliness can at least be interesting. It shouldn’t be
        necessary to cheer up, in order to continue, and there might be some
        lessons worth attending to in the slough of despond.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d go further. Despair can get things started, if it means the
        abandonment of diverting idols. A full, immersive soaking, which leaves
        no doubt about certain things <em>being over</em>,  is morbidly
        therapeutic, and even something like a first step (at least a first
        <a href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html">slouch</a>). There
        are hopes that have to die, and the sooner the better, although if  they
        die slowly and horribly, they are perhaps less likely to need killing
        twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the argument:
        <em>Nothing is going anywhere without preliminary disintegration</em>.
        That’s the cheerful part. It seems to me an absolutely irresistible
        claim, and this post was to have been designed to rally consensus around
        it. Then I made the ‘mistake’ of watching
        <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/videos/20111">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allow me to walk you into this little knot of gloom in stages,
        punctuated by theses, each of which marks an essential but incomplete
        discussion. The meta-assertion is that there is no other way. Push-back
        against that, met at any of its way-stations,  will make the dire
        swamp-thrashing to follow worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thesis-1: There is no more basic preliminary to effective neoreactionary
        transformation than schism. This can take many forms. Simple retirement
        into the private sphere — as strongly advocated by Nick B. Steves in
        particular — represents one significant pole. At the other lies
        secession, and other forms of macro-political disintegration (with
        science fiction variants extending from seasteading out to space
        colonization). The essential point is that
        <em>a consolidation of disagreement in space is substituted for a
          resolution of disagreement in time</em>. As far  as practicality is concerned, this is the overwhelming 
        priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thesis-2: There can be no agreement. The recent flurry of interest in
        Emmanuel Todd should suffice as confirmation (<a
          href="http://www.craigwilly.info/2013/07/07/emmanuel-todds-linvention-de-leurope-a-critical-summary/">this</a>
        critical summary by Craig Willy is excellent). In a very small nutshell,
        Todd argues that “… political ideologies in the modern age are
        projections of a people’s unconscious premodern family values.” Europe
        has four basic family types (all exogamous), programming its varied
        political ideals.<br />
        The inegalitarian (classical) liberalism of mercantile North-West
        Europeans, corresponds to the ‘Absolute nuclear family’.<br />
        Weird Franco-Italian ‘egalitarian liberalism’ corresponds to the
        ‘egalitarian nuclear family’ (Todd’s own ancestral type and value
        model).<br />
        The Germanic ‘Authoritarian family’ tends to German stuff, and<br />
        The (Slav-Orthodox) ‘Community family’ breeds communists.<br />
        If you haven’t read Willy yet, you’ll be glad you did. The sole
        take-away here: <em>People are different</em> (oops, that’s a signature
        judgement of the inegalitarian liberal type), with no tendency to
        converge upon common ideals, even among Europeans. There are people who
        think communism is natural and good, and they’re not going to be argued
        out of it. Only a small minority think what you do, and that isn’t going
        to change. You either have to kill them, dominate them, be dominated by
        them, <em>or escape them</em>. Escaping them is best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thesis-3: It’s America that matters (for Anglophone neoreactionaries, at
        least). It’s the only country with traditions of freedom that can be
        broken into large and influential pieces, and its residual federal
        structure provides a virtual template for doing exactly that. For
        practical purposes, therefore, the future of liberty —
        <em>even if you want to read that as the liberty to conduct experiments
          in ethnonationalist or theocratic government</em>
        —  is entirely dependent upon the development of American federalism.
        Further centralized consolidation is losing, and disintegration is
        winning. Compared to that, in terms of political practicality,
        everything else is of vanishing irrelevance. Dreaming up schemes for
        ideal authoritarian regimes, in particular, is simply a hobby (but you
        know that already, right?).
      </p>
      <p>
        The only road to the future, or the past, leads through a Disunited
        States of America. Now listen to those <em>Bloggingheads</em> again, and
        wind up the gloom to scream volume. It’s absolutely clear from a
        strictly technical point of view that the sole conceivable platform for
        an escape from Leviathan’s degenerative ratchet would be a
        <em>Confederate States of America</em>, and we can probably agree that
        historical sensitivities make that a non-starter. Setting out on a path
        away from futile arguments — between people who will never agree — leads
        straight back into America’s racial nightmare, and horrible, draining,
        unresolvable wrangling that amounts to:
        <em>Freedom is banned forever, because … what happened to black
          people</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those arguments are stupidity itself. They go nowhere. And that is
        precisely the point.

      <h4 class="post-title">Reaction, Repetition, and Time</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Whether considered within the registers of <del>physics</del>,
        physiology, or politics, ‘reaction’ is a time-structured notion. It
        follows an action or stimulus, which it reaches back through, in order
        to annul or counteract  a disequilibrium or disturbance. Whilst
        subsequent to an action, it operates in alignment with what came before:
        the track, or legacy, that defines the path of reversal, or the target
        of restoration. It therefore envelops the present, to contest it from
        all sides. The Outside of the dominant moment is its space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaction forges, or excavates, an occult pact between the future and the
        past, setting both against the present, in concert, and thus
        differentiating itself from progressivism (which unites the present and
        future against the past), and  conservatism (which unites past and
        present against the future). Its bond with time as
        <em>outsideness</em> carries it ever further beyond the moment and its
        decay, into a twin horizon of anterior and posterior remoteness. It is a
        <a href="http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/theshadowoutoftime.htm">Shadow Out of Time</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a far more immediately practical reason for reaction to involve
        itself in the exploration of time, however: to take steps to avoid what
        it could scarcely otherwise avoid becoming — a sterile orgy of
        disgruntlement. Finding nothing in the present except deteriorated hints
        of other things, reaction soon slides into what it most detests: an
        impotent micro-culture of vocal, repetitive protest.
        <em>This isn’t right, this isn’t <em>right</em>, this isn’t </em><em>right</em> quickly becomes white noise,
        or
        worse (intelligible
        whining). Even when it escapes the ceaseless, mechanical reiteration of
        a critical diagnosis (whose tedium is commensurate to the narrowed times
        it damns), its schemes of restoration fall prey to a more extended
        repetition,  which calls only — and uselessly — for what has been to be
        once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the New Reaction is not to bore itself into a coma, it has to learn
        to run innovation and tradition together as Siamese twins, and for that
        it needs to think time, into distant conclusions, in its ‘own’ way.
        <em>That can be done,</em> seriously. Of course, a demonstration is
        called for …
      </p>
      <p>
        [Note: ‘physics’ deleted from the first line to pre-emptively evade a
        righteous spanking from enraged Newtonians insisting upon the strict
        simultaneity of actions and reactions within classical mechanics]

      <h4 class="post-title">On Goulding</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        James Goulding is a thinker of truly extraordinary brilliance. His
        intellectual stance is closer to that of <em>Outside in</em> than almost
        any other blog listed in our sidebar. It is with considerable sadness,
        therefore, that I have sought to comply with his shifted self-definition
        by moving the link to
        <em><a href="http://suspiriadeprofundis.net">suspiria de profundis</a></em>
        out of the ‘neoreaction’ category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goulding is subtle, complex, and difficult, and his central ideas remain
        only partially digested here. In addition, my grasp of the stakes in his
        new direction is extremely unformed. There are nevertheless a few
        preliminary remarks that I hope are worth making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neoreaction, or the Dark Enlightenment, has
        as its most essential tendency the insistence upon
        <em>an alternative to fascism</em>. Its realism does not embrace
        optimism readily, so it would be insincere to pretend that this
        alternative is destined for success. What cannot be convincingly denied,
        however, is that a reaction to the Cathedral is coming, that fascist
        modes of political rectification are well-placed to profit from it, and
        that Western — indeed all modern — societies default to fascism during
        crisis conditions. By separating himself from the new reaction, Goulding
        risks surrendering it to ominous potentialities that might otherwise be
        avoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matters. Whatever Goulding’s talents [add well-deserved
        superlatives], marketing and propaganda are not among them. He has never
        been less convincing than when
        <a href="http://suspiriadeprofundis.net/2013/06/02/how-to-join-movement-x/">suggesting</a>
        that ‘Movement X’ is a credible attractor for the disenchanted. As
        conservatism dies of chronic failure, what replaces it will be a
        reaction to the <em>status quo</em>, unashamed to identify itself as
        such, and positively exulting in the abominated label
        <em>reactionary</em>. Goulding seems to be sure that this prediction is
        wrong, for no very obvious reason, and this certainty plays to his own
        greatest intellectual weaknesses.
        <em>I beseech him, in the bowels of Gnon, to think it possible that he
          may be mistaken.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The practitioners of Machiavellian politics are politicians. They expose
        each other every day through their political machines, and
        <em>House of Cards</em> is already popular culture.
        <em>Everybody knows this stuff</em>, and it has no deep consequence.
        Politics is porn, an inane tangle of primate idiocy. It is unworthy of
        Goulding’s focused intelligence.

        <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/damn/">persuasive</a>
        enough to motivate a second look at Scott Alexander’s continuing

        <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/">It</a>
        is indeed “awesome,” and merits a serious response (later this week?).
      </p>
      <p>
        For an immediate response, simple translation has to suffice, stripping
        away the slanted “survive/thrive” language, and getting right to the
        point. Reactionaries think leftists are <strong>spoiled</strong>*:
        decadent, self-indulgent, hedonistic fantasists, debauching an
        inheritance they are incapable of adding to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Degeneracy is degeneracy**, whether it’s affordable or not. To the
        reactionary right it looks horrible, even in the absence of zombie
        apocalypse (but we’re getting one anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
        * How can a theory of left/right differentiation demonstrate such
        insensitive disregard for ‘the wretched of the earth’? It is that
        ‘problem’ — readily admitted by Alexander — that makes his explanation
        truly <em>awesome</em>. The Left has nothing to do with what the
        downtrodden ‘think’, and everyone — once pressed — is relieved to admit
        that. <em>Now everything makes sense</em>. We’re discussing a
        thought-pattern (Leftism) <em>exclusively</em> native to affluent
        degenerates, with the social sub-strata occasionally latching on,
        opportunistically, and uncomprehendingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        ** Yes, the word ‘degeneracy’ is historically spicy — if we were being
        responsible about it, it would make us nervous. Slicing diagonally
        through biology, culture, economics — even technology — it’s what
        reactionaries think socio-political ‘progress’ really is. In that
        respect, it’s indispensable.<br />
        So what is degeneration? — in any conversation entirely
        <em>internal</em> to reaction, that would be the central topic of
        discussion. (The <em>Outside in</em> definition: degeneracy is whatever
        makes you more stupid.)
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: Scott Alexander paraphrased: The Right doesn’t think we can
        afford to degenerate, whilst the Left thinks we can.<br />
        Scott Alexander nudged: The Right decries degeneration, even when it
        seems (in the short term) affordable. The Left advocates degeneration
        (in the medium term) even when, in the short term, we obviously can’t
        afford it.

        Matt Sigl of <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/">Vocativ</a> is writing an
        article on the Dark Enlightenment, both the ‘thing’ and the ‘manifesto’
        (I’ve already told him why this description is misleadingly
        over-generous). His questions suggest a sincere attempt to understand
        what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the lines of inquiry he is pursuing (my compressions): Why Now?
        What’s the ‘Cathedral’ business? How does the Dark Enlightenment relate
        to transhumanism/futurism, libertarianism, fascism, white supremacism,
        anti-semitism, social Darwinism? Where is the Dark Enlightenment going?
        How does it respond to criticisms that (a) capitalism is to blame, (b)
        everything’s basically OK?
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tried to respond as objectively as possible, whilst attempting to
        be clear about those answers which express my own idiosyncratic
        decisions regarding unsettled/disputed matters. Predictably, I have
        emphasized the Moldbuggian origins of the Dark Enlightenment /
        Neoreaction as a definite cultural phenomenon (distinct from
        pre-existing right-libertarian, traditionalist, and paleo-reactionary
        streams of thought).

        Whilst it’s undoubtedly flattering to be the target of a brutal, lazy,
        and dishonest hit
        <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2013/10/17/zombie-apocalypse-or-marginal-revolution/">piece</a>, it’s also
        vaguely
        irritating. Couldn’t Kuznicki have stoked the hate
        sufficiently with the rejection of democracy, HBD sympathies,
        anti-egalitarianism, market-fundamentalism, disintegrationism, and
        Shoggoth-whispering, without also making up a bunch of stuff?
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, just for the record:</p>
      <p>
        * I’m not a proponent of “white nationalistic race ‘realism’.”<br />
        * I nowhere make the “case that white nationalism and market liberalism
        somehow belong together.”<br />
        * I have never made a “case against markets” of any kind, let alone that
        they “stand behind democracy with a tyrannical, unpredictable veto”
        [whatever than means]<br />
        * I have never advocated for “racial purity”
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no doubt a number of people who turn up here who wish that I did
        make some of these arguments, and by distancing myself from them I’m not
        wanting to endorse Kuznicki’s suggestion that they’re mere slurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as Kuznicki’s own substantial points are concerned — defense of
        dialectics, voice, meliorative politics — I’m not really interested
        enough to engage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sort of situation tends to stress
        objectivity, so I won’t pretend to perfect balance on the subject. There
        seem to be lessons, though, of a quite general nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin with, the problem of ‘engagement’ with the media is a real one,
        which can only get more pressing in strict proportion to ‘success’. They
        have to come after Mencius Moldbug at some point, insofar as anything
        interesting is brewing up, so there will probably be further test runs
        against secondary targets. The whole target selection question is
        potentially interesting, but I’ve no special insight to share on that
        topic at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly I’ve lucked out in this case. China doesn’t seem
        Cathedral-compliant (as Stirner points out in the excellent comments
        thread), so direct social pressure is seriously dulled. Kuznicki is
        neither the sharpest knife in the drawer, nor a pitbull, so
        <em>weakness</em> has been the ‘dominant’ impression. The site he posts
        from, despite its Magazine-style format, is quite incredibly marginal —
        the traffic from this little blog to his has been running at
        two-to-three times the reverse (which I would never have imagined — they
        have ten contributors listed there). <em>Umlaut</em> also allows
        comments, which has been a comprehensive fiasco for them this time
        (check it out). All the visitors have been ripping into Kuznicki, and
        using the up/down vote system to quantify the point. I’m biased, but
        I’ve found it utterly hilarious. It’s worth noting, however, that the
        left media machine has been stripping out its comment threads, which
        makes them far more effective as no-comeback attack machines. Finally,
        Twitter has been an extraordinary resource. It’s an absolutely critical
        component of our capability to defend ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing all this together: We have to learn, prepare, and anticipate.
        The fights coming up are worth getting right. Any fatalistic depression
        about the might of our enemies is both self-fulfilling defeatism and to
        a considerable extent simply false. There’s no reason to think that the
        ‘destiny’ of media is under their control, or even that its trends are
        generally favorable to them. Practice is our friend. This stuff  is
        going to matter more and more. Luck won’t always run so obviously one
        way.

        of Neoreaction really doesn’t require hysteria. (The second half of the
        article is especially impressive.) If the custodians of Cathedral
        orthodoxy don’t find a way to punish him for his sobriety, this piece
        could set a new standard for public discussion of the anti-democratic
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… these movements tacitly accept that conservatism as a political
          force is utterly incapable of slowing the leftward march of
          liberalism. By definition, conservatives, who want to conserve the
          good things about the past, are always playing defense. When you
          consider that many of my conservative views aren’t terribly different
          from John F. Kennedy’s views in 1960, this becomes self-evident.</em>

        probably still gives them too much credit.” These kind of responses are
        making it ever more obvious how unhinged the libertarian commentary has
        been (with

        Due to a mixture of out-in-the-stickitude, device deficiency, and
        technical incompetence I can’t even link to the Demos attack on ‘the
        dark enlightenment’ hosted by The Daily Telegraph (at the right edge of
        the UK MSM). I’ll be grateful for a link to this piece in the comments
        here (complacently confident there’ll be one).
      </p>
      <p>Some not-quite-random remarks:</p>
      <p>
        1. The article is dismally poor, even by the standards of these things.
        Neoreaction is something cooked up by Moldy and me, apparently, starting
        from “two blogs”. It’s also ‘neofascism’.
      </p>
      <p>2. The comment thread isn’t remotely cooperating.</p>
      <p>3. Demos has an interesting history.</p>
      <p>
        4. As this nonsense gets bigger, it’s descending into sheer self-parody.
        Cathedral culture is a kind of chaos, which makes the strategic issues
        far more intriguing than the quality of this material might suggest.

        Into the closing days of this Cambodian escape, I’m now in Kep, on the
        coast of the Gulf of Thailand. It’s an interesting place (which I’ll say
        something about in the Cambodia scrap
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cambodia-scraps/">log</a>). Note the
        link there? There haven’t been any of those for a while. The reason it
        has now become possible is the <em>Kep Lodge</em> guest computer, which
        leaves my tablet in the dust. Links, cursor control, copy-and-paste …
        ecstasy. So I have to try and seize the opportunity …
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting meta, there are two media-reaction compilation resources which
        everyone needs to know about (and I’m sure just about everyone already
        does). Both are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up. Handle’s
        (<a href="http://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/reaction_ruckus/">here</a>) might by updating sluggishly
        for
        a few weeks, because the
        <em>Hausmeister</em> is taking a well-earned break. It might fall upon
        <em>Amos &amp; Gromar</em> (<a href="http://amosandgromar.wordpress.com/neoreaction-in-the-news/">here</a>) to
        track developments, which are getting steadily more encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The American Thinker</em> isn’t exactly
        MSM, but it’s still highly significant that Christopher Chantrill has
        written the first Dark Enlightenment
        <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2014/01/the_dark_enlightenment_hits_stage_two.html">commentary</a>
        for a relatively mainstream conservative site that doesn’t engage in any
        skirt-clutching whatsoever. It’s a short, friendly piece that is best
        understood as a deliberate exercise in de-toxification. Prediction: this
        brewing media storm is going to start opening consequential fault-lines
        in the conservative movement, which as far as any DE strategic schedule
        is concerned, gets us to first base. It follows, of course, that
        establishment conservative responses will get even more hysterical (and
        that also counts as a win).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some substantial engagement from beyond the reactosphere is also in
        prospect from Adam Gurri (who has some genuinely productive lines of
        criticism). There’s also Patri Friedman (<a
          href="https://m.facebook.com/patri.friedman/posts/101522224034719766">link</a>?– can’t get it to work from
        here),  who commits to exploring “a more
        politically correct dark enlightenment” (via @MikeAnissimov twitter)
        which has to — at the very least — be extremely entertaining. Given the
        prevailing distribution of forces, confusion has to be our friend
        (right?).
      </p>
      <p>
        Related developments of interest include a tendency within the HBD
        ‘community’ to seize the ‘Dark Enlightenment’ (brand) for themselves,
        chucking out all the awkward right-wingery (via rumorous twitter). I’ve
        no sense at all of the mechanism by which ‘they’ think they can achieve
        that, but the impulse is disorganizing, and therefore probably to be
        approved (although, of course, at the same time fiercely contested).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepting that chaos is ‘bad’, it seems to me that it is especially bad
        for our opponents, whose piecemeal suppression strategy requires social
        conditioning by a maximally-simple aversion response. Their stage-1
        campaign is based on something like a “Neoreaction — yuk, Nazis!”
        reflex. Anything that leads instead to “What? Hang on a minute …”
        reaction counts (for them) as a major fail. There can be no serious
        doubt that we’re well into that (as the comment threads of all the
        hit-pieces so far attest). So, prediction-2: we’re going to see a second
        phase hostile media approach emerging really soon — over the next few
        months — adapted to important constituencies who are refusing the
        desired stimulus-response programming. I’ve no idea what this will look
        like, but it’s almost bound to be more intellectually engaging than
        anything we’ve seen so far.
      </p>
      <p>Some straggly extras:</p>
      <p>
        At the risk of getting Matt Sigl into trouble, it’s quite obvious that
        he’s a thoughtful guy who deserves better editors. Are we going to see
        another piece by him (stripped of the Cathedral tics) some time this
        year?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tim Stanley is a pathetic tool, but there are some impressive
        <em>Telegraph</em> writers (<del>Ed West</del>, James Dellingpole …),
        are they going to jump in at some point?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <em>Telegraph</em> can be cracked (still uncertain), how about
        the <em>National Review</em>? If Steyn has problems with us, they won’t
        be stupid, and he really doesn’t like witch hunters.
      </p>

        We’ll get so bored by this expression, if we aren’t already, but —
        <em>interesting times</em>.

        rank exposure in the current media wave are Mencius Moldbug (naturally),
        Michael Anissimov, and me. To make a very obvious point explicit,
        however, this is wildly disproportionate, and — I suspect — not long
        sustainable. Moldbug is a transcendental master, about whom enough can
        never be said, but Mike and I are both highly atypical representatives
        of (very different) neoreactionary extremes. If
        <em>Amos &amp; Gromar</em> (for non-random instance) was shifted to
        center stage, the whole phenomenon would become vastly more sane. (In
        this particular case, I suspect that an A&amp;G has a branding issue,
        because media get confused about ‘who’ exactly they’re pointing at — and
        frankly I think I’m pretty good at that stuff. MARKETING people!)

        humiliating I can only assume he’ll want to take it down.

      <p>
        <em><strong>The Dark Enlightenment Exposed</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I first heard about the Dark Enlightenment (aka “Neo-Reaction” or
          just “Reaction”) last year, the year after I graduated from college
          and was interning at a conservative think tank. I briefly become
          involved with the Dark Enlightenment and then left the movement in
          disgust. Here is what I learned:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– The Dark Enlightenment is controlled by what the media call “Sith
          Lords”. You have more public Lords like Mencius Moldbug and Nick Land,
          but there are even some Lords up higher whose names are not revealed.
          They say the Master Lord says ‘Et Ego in Arcadia’ which is an anagram
          for ‘Tego Arcana Dei’ (“I hide the secrets of God”).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– But only the media call them ‘Sith Lords’. In Inner Speak, they
          will often use phrases like the Men of Númenor or the Eldars.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– I never met any of the higher Eldars, but I did once meet an Eldar
          in Training. I don’t know his real name but people called him Legolas.
          He had long blond hair, was dressed like a 19th century count, and
          wore a pendant that had both a Christian Cross and Thor’s Hammer on
          it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– The movement is a weird mixture of ethno-nationalists, futurists,
          monarchists, PUAs (“pick-up artists” like Chateau Heartiste), Trad
          Catholics, Trad Protestants, etc. They all believe in HBD (what they
          call “human biodiversity” i.e. racism) but disagree on some other
          minor points.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– The religious people in the movement (both Christians and pagans)
          practice what is called “identitarian religion” (religion that doesn’t
          deny ethnic identity).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– Some of the rising stars of the Dark Enlightenment on the internet
          seem to be Radish Magazine, Occam’s Razor Mag, and Theden TV.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– The Dark Enlightenment allegedly has millions of dollars of money
          to play with. They have a couple big donors. One is rumored to be a
          major tech tycoon in Silicon Valley. They actually had a private 3-day
          meeting on an island which was furnished with a French chef, etc.
          Different forms of formal attire were required for each day (tuxedos,
          3-piece suits, etc), and some weird costumes were required too (capes,
          hoods, etc) — which sound like a pagan cult. (I wasn’t at this
          function but heard about it.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– I was initiated into the first stages of the Dark Enlightenment,
          which involved me stripping down naked so people could “inspect my
          phenotype”. I was then given a series of very personal questions,
          often relating to sexual matters. I was then told to put on a black
          cape. (I really regret doing this but at the time I was younger, more
          impressionable and eager to please.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– For the initial oath taking, everyone must swear on a copy of
          Darwin’s Origin of Species, just to show their fidelity to HBD. After
          that, for the later oaths, seculars will swear again on Darwin, while
          Christians will swear on the Bible, and pagans on the Prose Edda or
          Iliad.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– At one of the meetings I heard someone continuously chanting “gens
          alba conservanda est” (Latin for “the white race must be preserved”)
          and then others were chanting things in Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse and Old
          German, but I don’t know those languages so I can’t remember exactly
          what they were saying.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– They also have all their own secret handshakes, and their own
          terminology [like the Cathedral (“political correctness”), thedening
          (“re-establishing ethnic group identity”), genophilia (“love of one’s
          own race”), NRx (“neoreaction”), etc.].</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>– On the philosophical level, this movement is not entirely original.
          Much of it is borrowed from the Identitarian movement in Europe. They
          also all detest democracy. They are not trying to be a “populist
          movement” but are only trying to convert other elites to their way of
          thinking.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          This whole movement is like a secret cult, which is why I left. Also,
          because of the valiant and brave efforts of people on the net exposing
          this movement, I saw this cult for the evil it truly is. Please stay
          away from it.</em>

        It’s carefully hedged (and ultimately contested), but it’s well worth
        noting. He begins the relevant section of a recent
        <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/">post</a>
        by revisiting the self-observation: “In the past two months I have
        inexplicably and very very suddenly become much more conservative.”
        (Pass-the-popcorn.)

        <em>The explanation I like least is that it comes from reading too much
          neoreaction. I originally rejected this hypothesis because I don’t
          believe most what I read. But I’m starting to worry that there are
          memes that, like
          <a href="http://www.laughbreak.com/stories/horseshoe_logic.html">Bohr’s horseshoe</a>, affect you whether

          <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/11/going-loopy/">feedback loop</a>. I have long suspected social
          justice contains some of these. Now I
          worry neoreaction contains others.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>In particular I worry about the neoreactionary assumption that
          leftism always increases with time, and that today’s leftism confined
          to a few fringe idiots whom nobody really supports today becomes
          tomorrow’s mainstream left and the day after tomorrow’s “you will be
          fired if you disagree with them”. Without me ever really evaluating
          its truth-value it has wormed its way into my brain and started
          haunting my nightmares.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m usually reluctant to take Alexander seriously when he tells us what
        Neoreaction is, but in this case I think he gets it right.
      </p>
      <p>
        He embeds this passage in an encompassing theory, aiming to frame the
        degenerative ratchet within a directionless random-walk of fashion
        (driven by something like abstract cellular automata). The theory is
        clever, but its historical fit is so poor I don’t expect it to last
        indefinitely. In the best case, during the few months it takes for this
        psychic-defense system to start falling apart and strewing parts along
        the doom-route of accelerating Left-Singularity, Alexander can dedicate
        his exceptional mind to collecting alternative cognitive
        defense-mechanisms and testing them to destruction. In this way he can
        contribute to clearing the desert at the end of our world.

    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        From the perspective of an intrigued (and thoughtfully critical)
        libertarian, Andrea Castillo offers an initial
        <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/07/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-neoreaction-for-libertarians/">appraisal</a>
        of Neoreaction. It’s definitely the most dispassionate yet, and in
        various ways the most perceptive (which isn’t to forget how admirable
        Adam Gurri’s more obviously polemical
        <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/02/10/mencius-moldbug-is-a-technocrat/">engagement</a>
        was).
      </p>
      <p>
        The greatest structural merit of the piece is the firm positioning of
        Mencius Moldbug at the foundations of the phenomenon. Unlike most of the
        critical NRx commentary so far, Castillo has clearly read Moldbug with
        some care. This is basically enough in itself to ensure that something
        real is being seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Sailer, who served Castillo unwittingly as a gateway into the
        darkness, receives disproportionate attention given his manifest lack of
        affiliation with NRx. Of course, he’s hugely-respected throughout the
        reactosphere due to his rare refusal to stop ‘<a
          href="http://isteve.blogspot.hk/2014/01/patton-oswalt-political-correctness-is.html">noticing</a>‘ upon firm
        request. Beyond the fact he hasn’t let the Cathedral put
        his eyes out, however, there’s nothing very much to differentiate him
        from mainstream American conservatism. Still, Sailer’s presence in the
        piece does much useful work. In particular, it helps to mark out the
        boundary controversies defining contemporary libertarianism (the
        immigration topic prominent among them).

        <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/kxb/nrx_vs_prog_assumptions_locating_the_sources_of/">post</a>
        at Less Wrong, attempting to make sense of Neoreaction through contrast
        with Progressivism. Given the great internal diversity of NRx, combined
        with its embryonic stage of self-formulation (in many respects), the
        lucidity Opitz brings to the topic is no slight achievement. His post is
        among the most impressive Ideological Turing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_Turing_Test">Test</a>
        performances I have yet seen.
      </p>
      <p>The core paragraph (among much else of great interest):</p>
      <p>
        <em><strong>Neoreaction says</strong>, “There is objective value in the
          principle of “perpetuating biological and/or civilizational
          complexity” itself*; the best way to perpetuate biological and/or
          civilizational complexity is to “serve Gnon” (i.e. devote our efforts
          to fulfilling nature’s pre-requisites for perpetuating our biologial
          and/or civilizational complexity); our subjective values are spandrels
          manufactured by natural selection/Gnon; insofar as our subjective
          values motivate us to serve Gnon and thereby ensure the perpetuation
          of biological and/or civilizational complexity, our subjective values
          are useful. (For example, natural selection makes sex a subjective
          value by making it pleasurable, which then motivates us to perpetuate
          our biological complexity). But, insofar as our subjective values
          mislead us from serving Gnon (such as by making non-procreative sex
          still feel good) and jeopardize our biological/civilizational
          perpetuation, we must sacrifice our subjective values for the
          objective good of perpetuating our biological/civilizational
          complexity” (such as by buckling down and having procreative sex even
          if one would personally rather not enjoy raising kids).</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          *Note that different NRx thinkers might have different definitions
          about what counts as biological or civilizational “complexity” worthy
          of perpetuating … it could be “Western Civilization,” “the White
          Race,” “Homo sapiens,” “one’s own genetic material,” “intelligence,
          whether encoded in human brains or silicon AI,” “human
          complexity/Godshatter,” etc. This has led to the so-called
          “neoreactionary trichotomy”—3 wings of the neoreactionary movement:
          Christian traditionalists, ethno-nationalists, and
          techno-commercialists.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>Most LessWrongers probably agree with neoreactionaries on this
          fundamental normative assumption, with the typical objective good of
          LessWrongers being “human complexity/Godshatter,” and thus the
          “techno-commercialist” wing of neoreaction being the one that
          typically finds the most interest among LessWrongers.</em>

          comments effective immediately. It’s emotionally charged and
          politicized in a way that I think potential substitutes aren’t. I got
          my first exposure to far-right ideas from the neoreactionaries and so
          historically I’ve viewed rightism through their lens and spread that
          to my readers, but I think that this emphasis was a mistake. Also,
          nobody agrees on what “neoreactionary” means, least of all
          self-identified neoreactionaries. If you want to talk about
          monarchists, call them monarchists. If you want to talk about
          traditionalists, call them traditionalists. If you want to talk about
          the far right, call it the far right. If you want to talk about HBD,
          call it HBD. If you want to talk about Mencius Moldbug, call him
          Mencius Moldbug. First infraction will be punished with a warning,

        <em>… in the decades since, as the consumer-oriented liberalism of Bill
          Gates and Steve Jobs gave way to the technological authoritarianism of
          Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, this strange foundation paved the way for
          even stranger tendencies. The strangest of these is known as
          “neoreaction,” or, in a distorted echo of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s vision,
          the “Dark Enlightenment.” It emerged from the same chaotic process
          that yielded the anarchic political collective Anonymous, a product of
          the hivemind generated by the cybernetic assemblages of social media.
          More than a school of thought, it resembles a meme. The genealogy of
          this new intellectual current is refracted in the mirror of the most

        Is anyone else beginning to get a little … I think the technical term is

        <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/08/its-not-racist-to-seek-an-exit/">happening</a>
        in the media?
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that the central convergence point of neoreaction is an analysis
        of media power as the consummation of the (Anglophone) mainstream trend
        in global political history, it’s impossible to find this sort of thing
        <em>simply</em> amusing. Cathedral theory predicts a quasi-stable closed
        loop in which left-progressive academic self-organization obtains ever
        more comprehensive social dominion through a conductive media system.
        When the media strays off message, by allowing things to be noticed that
        — entirely lacking academic endorsement — cannot legitimately exist,
        something of profound social significance is taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
        There might be any number of intriguing opportunities in these (still
        deeply cryptic) developments. For Mencius Moldbug, however, I suspect
        life could soon become uncomfortably<em> interesting</em>. The attack
        dogs of the left have left him alone, in the hope that he would remain
        unknown and ignored. Once that hope dies, the leashes are sure to come
        off.

        The <em>Hacker News</em> discussion
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9674992">thread</a> on The
        Moldbug Affair is not to be missed. To call it ‘historic’ wouldn’t be
        (much of) and exaggeration. It’s well-worth a look just for the Urbit
        insights alone. In addition (and quite separately from the last point)
        ‘yarvin9’ pops up to make an impressive demonstration of not groveling
        to the mob. That, hopefully, could provide a model for the many others
        who will find themselves in analogous witch-trial hot-seats over the
        months and years to come.
      </p>
      <p>A few highlights.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>devalier </strong>, on Urbit:<br />
        <em>It wasn’t the code itself that I learned from. I have more been
          enriched and stimulated by reading the blog posts, documentation,
          hacker news threads, and mailing list. A couple of the more
          interesting ideas are:<br />
          * He created Nock, which in a way is bytecode language, like compiled
          java bytecode or the .NET CIL. But his idea was that this bytecode
          should be the simplest possible thing, far, far simpler than the CLR.
          In fact, it should be versioned in Kelvin versioning, starting at
          5,000 and counting down, until it is finally perfected and will never
          need to change. Going forward, all consumer apps will always compile
          down to this bytecode. All new hardware platforms can build
          interpreters for this bytecode. I think that is a pretty novel and
          neat approach. If it caught on, it would ensure that any program we
          wrote now could be run for the next thousand years.<br />
          * His view is that to beat spam, you simply need to have a finite
          number of cryptographically secured identities. This number can be
          large. But if it is finite, that means accounts will not be costless,
          which means the market over time will be able to solve the problems of
          trust and filtering out spam in a way far superior to how it works
          today.<br />
          It’s hard to do the ideas justice by trying to repeat them myself. In
          reading through the material it was just lots of little things, where
          I said to myself, “Ah, that is a neat solution to that problem, I
          wonder if he’ll be able to make it work.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality sarcasm from <strong>13thLetter</strong>:<br />
        <em>What a crazy coincidence. This talk was accepted when nobody knew who
          Yarvin was, but now that you and your friends want to cast him out
          into the wilderness for disagreeing with your political opinions, all
          of a sudden you realize that the talk was technically uninteresting
          anyway. What are the odds, huh?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>yarvin9</strong> on racism:<br />
        <em>I shouldn’t post as urbit. Quite a few other people, few of whom
          agree with me on anything, have worked on the project.<br />
          The word “racist” and its conjugations does not appear in the English
          language until the 1920s – see Peter Frost’s cultural history
          <a href="http://www.unz.com/pfrost/age-of-reason/">*</a>. If you asked
          Shakespeare if he was a “racist,” he would not know what you meant.<br />
          “Racist” is essentially a term of abuse which no group or party has
          ever applied to itself. Like most such epithets, it has two meanings –
          a clear objective one, describing a person who fails to believe in the
          anthropological theories of human equality which became first popular,
          then universal in the mid-20th century; and a caricature of the vices,
          personal or political, typically engaged in by such a foul
          unbeliever.</em><br />
        [This non-apology under pressure is truly glorious]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>topynate</strong> on the realistic micro-sociology of crimethink
        definition:<br />
        <em>Kicking people from your tech conference because they were racist
          outside of it hands veto power to whoever determines what racism is
          and when something is ‘too racist’. The same goes for the other
          beyond-the-pale isms like sexism, fascism, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>paxdickinson</strong> on precedent:<br />
        <em>It’ll be [Alex Miller’s] decision next time too. And now that the Red
          Guards know he’ll succumb to even the slightest bit of pressure, there
          will certainly be a next time.</em>

      <p>
        Some immediate take-away? ‘Neoreactionary’ (the word) has crossed a
        currency threshold, and its destiny is now vastly senseless. It’s
        retrospectively obvious that if anything was going to happen to it in
        the wider culture, it was going to be this. Roughly, it’s becoming what
        ‘neoconservative’ and ‘neoliberal’ were, and are: a political term that
        circulates socially because it designates something vague and scary to
        its enemies, who then use it as a smear-ghoul to tar things they don’t
        understand, and don’t like. This probably sounds bad, but if we think
        so, it’s a sign of how unrealistic we’ve been about the dominant
        semiotic processes in degenerating democracies. It wasn’t ever going to
        be any other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Running isn’t going to work. There’s an argument to be made for fleeing
        territory, but to flee signs is utterly pointless. There’s no superior
        semiotic position to be escaped to. The way this is happening is the way
        it happens. It has to be understood, worked through, played with. As the
        Wittgenstein-<a href="http://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/">tendency</a>
        of NRx would surely be the first to concur, private languages are
        intrinsically delusive. When your antagonist is a titanic cultural
        control apparatus, your words are going to get messed with in ways that
        seem simply insane. That’s the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not — by any means — an altogether disastrous situation, at least,
        not any more than the situation in general is
        <a href="http://freenortherner.com/2014/07/25/weve-lost/">disastrous</a>. Even if the dominant public sense of
        a
        co-opted word is allusive,
        polemical, and strategically abusive, there is still a subtle
        undercurrent of awkwardness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Oh man, those Tea-Party morons are like total tools of the
        neoreactionaries!”<br />
        “Yeah, too right! <em>*snork* *snork* *snork*</em>” (<em>What the hell is a neoreactionary? Gotta Google that
          m***********</em>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And really, it doesn’t matter what they think — except right out on the
        margin, where things slip. It’s obviously going to be the targets of the
        smear-ghouling, in a few peculiar cases, who ask:
        <em>If this ‘neoreaction’ business is creating so much fear and loathing
          among our enemies, there might be something to it that I’d like</em>.

        Conspiracy construction is an essential part of the process. It’s a way
        the Left-establishment digests threats without having to think about
        them, keeping the problem purely strategic, rather than ideological. One
        consequence — eventually it brings a conspiracy into being. If war has
        been declared, you might as well fight back. In this sense, the swelling
        wave of Silicon Valley conspiracy mongering on the Left strikes me as
        wholly positive, its absurdity notwithstanding. Tech billionaires who
        find themselves in the cross-hairs of this stuff are pretty much forced
        to acknowledge that appeasement isn’t working. Some of them are going to
        get the idea that the Cathedral wants to destroy them. At that point,
        they start looking for options.

        pointed lesson from the same Tech-Comm island bastion, with a title that
        doesn’t even try to distance itself from hardcore Dark Enlightenment
        through use of a strategic question mark: “Singapore Challenges the Idea
        That Democracy Is the Best Form of Governance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s written by a Westerner this time, Graham Allison, who — to complete
        the extremity of infiltration — is “Director, Belfer Center for Science
        and International Affairs, <strong>Harvard</strong> Kennedy School” (XS
        emphasis). So he can say anything he wants, and he says this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For a provocative analogy, think of countries as if they were hotels
          and citizens as guests. … Rarely do guests offer views about the
          ownership of the hotel or how it is governed.</em>
        [That last sentence is about as close to pure Moldbug as you can get
        without actually quoting the
        <del datetime="2015-08-10T13:03:35+00:00">guy</del> monster.] …
        <em>“Liberty” … includes both “freedom from” and “freedom to.” …
          Singapore stands at the top of the international competition on
          “freedoms from:” It ranks first internationally in the World Bank’s
          measure of “regulatory quality” and second on The Heritage
          Foundation’s scale of economic freedom</em>
        [First, of course, is Hong Kong],
        <em>while the U.S. comes in 13th. Gallup’s 2014 World Poll found that
          eight in 10 Americans see “widespread corruption” in the U.S.
          government, compared with seven in the Philippines, six in Zimbabwe
          and one in Singapore. On the World Bank’s “rule of law” index,
          Singapore scores in the 95th percentile of nations, the U.S. scores in
          the 91st, the Philippines in the 42nd and Zimbabwe in the 2nd. With a
          population of almost six million,
          <a href="https://data.unodc.org/#state:2">Singapore’s incidents of robbery</a>
          were only a seventh of
          <a href="http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Boston-Massachusetts.html">Boston’s</a>, which has a
          population
          of
          only 650,000. … When we turn to “freedom
          to” metrics, however, one-party Singapore scores well below the U.S.
          on three of our core freedoms: “freedom of expression and belief,”
          “associational and organizational rights” and “political pluralism and
          participation.” … When one asks “hotel customers” for feedback, the
          results are even more troubling for Americans. As the table below
          shows, four out of five Singaporeans are satisfied customers. They
          have confidence in their elections, their judicial system, their local
          police and their national leadership. In contrast, only one in three
          Americans has confidence in our national government and the country’s
          leadership; fewer than half regard elections as honest; and
          three-quarters of the population sees widespread corruption in
          government.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at SingGov as a business corporation (“hotel”) and it’s delivering
        an efficient, attractive service. WashCorp, not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up from HuffPo —
        <em>Is decomposition of the United States into Patchwork micro-states an
          idea who’s time has come?</em>
        (Unlike Allison’s editors, I’ve thrown in the question mark there out of
        fidelity to liberal traditions.)

        XS has a few quibbles with
        <a href="https://counter.fund/">this</a> project, while nevertheless
        thinking it’s probably the most intelligent thing taking place on the
        right at the moment. (Some highly interesting chat
        <a href="https://realitycallsshow.com/pax-dickenson-counter-fund-the-new-alt-right-political-party/">here</a>,
        or
        directly

      </p>
      <p>
        The reliance on personal discretion for ideological vetting is a sign of
        immaturity (as Pax seems to accept, since it’s intended to be
        temporary). Less protocol governance-oriented types will probably find
        this less of a needling issue than this blog does. In any case, the
        scheme is inclined towards trustlessness, which is the primary
        functional criterion for all 21st Century social technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more intriguing quibble is that the “co-op grocery store” model runs
        directly contrary to basic NeoCam principles, since it deliberately
        offers a role in governance to customers. This could be the basis for an
        important conversation down the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main positive, as always with Pax Dickinson initiatives, is that it aims
        (competently) to latch onto the grain of the Internet, and that of
        auto-catalytic social machinery more generally. Whenever the “What is to
        be Done?” question arises, this is the type of thing that needs pointing
        to. Pieces of the future manifestly drift back into it.

        Once it is accepted that the right can never agree about anything, the
        opportunity arises to luxuriate in the delights of diversity.
        Libertarianism already rivaled Trotskyism as a source of almost
        incomprehensibly compact dissensus, but the New Reaction looks set to
        take internecine micro-factionalism into previously unimagined
        territories. We might as well enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="http://www.alternativeright.com">crypto-fascists</a>,
        <a href="http://orthosphere.org">theonomists</a>, and
        <a href="http://anomalyuk.blogspot.com">romantic royalists</a>, to
        <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com">jaded classical liberals</a> and
        <a href="http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com">hard-core constitutionalists</a>, the reaction contains an entire
        ideological cosmos within itself.
        Hostility to coercive egalitarianism and a sense that Western
        civilization is going to hell will probably suffice to get you into the
        club. Agreeing on anything much beyond that? Forget it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s one dimension of reactionary diversity that strikes
        <em>Outside in</em> as particularly consequential (insofar as anything
        out here in the frozen wastes has consequences): the articulation of
        <em>reaction and politics</em>. Specifically: is the reaction an
        alternative politics, or a lucid (= cynically realistic) anti-politics?
        Is democracy bad politics, or simply politics, elaborated towards the
        limit of its inherently poisonous  potential?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> Outside in</em> sides emphatically with the anti-political ‘camp’.
        Our cause is <em>depoliticization</em> (or catallaxy, negatively
        apprehended).
        <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/LtrLbrty/bryTSO.html">The tradition of spontaneous order</a>
        is our heritage.  The New Reaction warns that the tide is against us.
        Intelligence will be required, in abundance, if we are to swim the other
        way, and we agree with the theonomists at least in this: if it is drawn
        from non-human sources, so much the better. Markets, machines, and
        monsters might inspire us. Rulers of any kind? Not so much.

        The ‘Spandrellian Trichotomy’ (Nick B. Steves’ coinage, based on
        <a href="http://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/04/10/conflict/">this</a>
        post) has become an awesome engine of discussion. The topic is seething
        to such an extent that any linkage list will be out of date as soon as
        it is compiled. Among the most obvious way-markers are

        <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/optimizing-for-truth/">this</a>. Given the need to
        refer
        to
        this complex succinctly, I trust that
        abbreviating it to ‘the Trichotomy’ will not be interpreted as a clumsy
        attempt to obstruct Spandrell’s Nobel Peace Prize candidacy.
      </p>
      <p>What is already broadly agreed?</p>
      <p>
        (1) There is a substratum of neoreactionary
        consensus, involving a variety of abominated realist insights,
        especially the contribution of deep heritage to socio-political
        outcomes. Whilst emphasis differs, an ultra-Burkean attitude is tacitly
        shared, and among those writers who self-identify with the
        <em>Dark Enlightenment</em>, the importance of HBD is generally
        foregrounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Neoreaction also shares an enemy: the <em>Cathedral</em> (as
        delineated by Mencius Moldbug). On the nature of this enemy much is
        agreed, not least that it is defined by a project of deep heritage
        erasure — both ideological and practical — which simultaneously effaces
        its own deep heritage as a profound religious syndrome, of a peculiar
        type. Further elaboration of Cathedral genealogy, however, ventures into
        controversy. (In particular, its consistency with Christianity is a
        fiercely contested topic.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) As neoreactionary perspectives are systematized, they tend to fall
        into a trichotomous pattern of dissensus. This, ironically, is
        <em>something that can be agreed</em>. The Trichotomy, or neoreactionary
        triad, is determined by divergent identifications of the Western
        tradition that the Cathedral <em>primarily</em> suppresses: Christian,
        Caucasian, or Capitalist.
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/neoreaction-for-dummies/">My</a>
        preferred terms for the resultant neoreactionary strains are,
        respectively, the <em>Theonomist</em>; the <em>Ethno-Nationalist</em>;
        and the <em>Techno-Commercial</em>. These labels are intended to be
        accurate, neutral descriptions, without intrinsic polemical baggage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is to be expected — at least initially, and occasionally — that each
        strain will seek to dismiss, subordinate, or amalgamate the other two.
        If they were not so tempted, their trichotomous disintegration would
        never have arisen. Each <em>must</em> believe that it, alone, has the
        truth, or the road to truth, unless sheer insincerity reigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Outside in</em> does not pretend to impartiality, but it asserts an
        invincible disillusionment.<br />
        — If the Trichotomy was reducible, the new reaction would already be one
        thing. It isn’t, and it isn’t (soon) going to be.<br />
        — As astrology reveals, and more ‘sophisticated’ systems confirm, people
        delight in being categorized, accepting non-universality as the real
        price of identification. (The response to Scharlach’s diagram attests to
        that.)<br />
        — Accepting the Trichotomy and the arguments it organizes is a way to be
        tested, and any neoreactionary position that refuses it will die a
        flabby death.<br />
        — The Trichotomy makes it impossible for neoreaction to play at
        dialectics with the Cathedral. For that reason alone, we should be
        grateful to it. Unity — even oppositional unity — was never on our side.

        to the White Nationalist fraternity, the Dark Enlightenment tends to
        like civilized people even when they aren’t <em>really white</em>. I

        It’s certainly amusing that the only people who don’t think we’re Nazis
        are the Nazis. They recognize that “cognitive elitists” are inherently
        prone to race treachery — which could be pushed all the way out to
        species treachery (if I have anything to do with it).
        <em>Optimize for intelligence</em> isn’t any kind of key to racial
        solidarity, or solidarity of any other kind. Even HBD, they generally
        insist, isn’t <em>them</em> (it’s too attentive to PISA
        <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf">ratings</a>
        and such). There are some seriously interesting controversies implicit
        in all this, although rage is likely to break them up before they get
        very far. It makes me realize that one thing I appreciate about the
        Neoreaction is its anger management, which is inextricable from its
        taste for irony (and probably also from its decadence).

    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/retro-dialectics/">
      <h4 class="post-title">Retro-Dialectics</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Nobody familiar with contemporary Western societies can be
        intellectually challenged by the idea of a great dialectical resolution
        to the problem of liberalism. Coercion and liberty are fused in a
        political order that directs authority towards the maximization of
        choice without consequence. Stupidity is sacred, and neither tradition
        nor natural necessity has the right to inhibit it. Preserving the
        freedom to fathom the limits of dysfunction in every direction is the
        primary social obligation, with the full resources of Leviathan behind
        it. If that’s not exactly where we are, it will be soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against this backdrop, Neoreaction emerges as a de-synthesizing impulse,
        splintering along multiple paths, but especially two. In reacting
        against <em>authoritarian irresponsibility</em> (or ‘anarcho-tyranny’)
        it tends to a restoration of the Old Antithesis:
        <em>either</em> hierarchical solidarity, <em>or</em> a ruthless
        dis-solidarity (and as it undoes the progressive dialectic, ‘either’
        fragments into ‘both’ — separately). Only the state
        <em>protected irresponsibility</em> of resolved Left-liberalism is
        strictly intolerable, because that has been historically demonstrated to
        be an engine of degeneration. Neoreaction, initially conceived, is
        anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the West unravels back to the Old
        Antithesis, the primary argumentative polarity of Neoreaction is exposed
        with increasing clarity (Neoreaction <em>is</em> this exposure). Given
        that irresponsibility is not to be protected, is it to be prevented (by
        a new paternalism) or abandoned to its intrinsic consequences (through
        reversion to Social Darwinism)? In other words, is the dominant theme
        <em>hierarchy</em> or <em>exit</em>? Any attempt to force a rapid
        decision — however tempting this might be — is to trivialize the
        submerged grandeur of the abyss. The degenerative dialectic has at least
        half a millennium of heritage behind it — and perhaps at least two
        millennia. The Old Antithesis is far greater than either of its
        constituent ‘options’.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <em>More Right</em>
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/premises-of-reactionary-thought/">outlines</a>
        its ‘Premises of Reactionary Thought’ there can be no doubt which side
        of the antithesis is being promoted. It thereby declares that
        <em>the Left-liberal synthesis is dead</em>, establishing itself as the
        articulation of a Neoreactionary stance. Its partiality, however, is
        overt. (<em>Outside in</em> advances a counter-partiality.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If failure is — eventually — no longer to be sustained, it either has to
        be prevented, or intensified. Neither <em>stop it failing</em> nor
        <em>let it fail</em> are remotely equivalent to
        <em>let it continue failing forever</em>, but neither are coercion and
        neglect commensurable to each other. The Old Antithesis is going to keep
        us on edge during 2014. If Neoreaction can even more explicitly
        <em>be the unraveling</em>, it will go far, but it will not obviously be
        <em>one thing</em>. The ‘one thing’ is virtually dead. What comes next
        arrives in pieces.

    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/2014-a-prophecy/">
      <h4 class="post-title">2014: A Prophecy</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        As has been said innumerable times before, any prophecy concerning
        outcomes that involve the ‘prophet’ as an agent are seriously suspect.
        For the (apparent) moment, such concerns are being pushed up the road
        into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There they have already made themselves ‘at home’ — along with much else
        related to the general phenomenon of prediction (which is strictly
        indistinguishable from time travel, when incisively understood).
        Present<em>
          knowledge of the future is an action of the future upon the
          present</em>, but all that can wait, since — of course — it doesn’t need to.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the Prophecy:
        <strong>2014 is the year in which Neoreaction tears itself apart</strong>. This is not at all to say, <em>the
          year
          in which it dies</em>. On the
        contrary, it will end the year strengthened in ways it has not to this
        point envisaged, having carved out vast tracts of clarity, hardened
        itself through close intellectual combat, refined its methods of
        de-synthesis (or catabolism), and — most importantly of all — made
        schism an internal dynamic principle. What integrates Neoreaction by the
        end of the year will no longer be elective tenets (reflecting the
        more-or-less precarious ideological preferences of individuals) but
        conflict-toughened structures of objective micro-cultural cohesion,
        selected and sculpted by many months of ferocious storms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approximate contours of these impending ruptures will provide the
        content for the first <em></em><em>2014 Prognoses</em> post (which is
        already overdue). In anticipation, it need only be noted: the Dark
        Enlightenment finds nothing external to itself that is
        <em>hard</em> enough to sharpen its claws. It has feasted on soft, fat,
        bleating lambs long enough. Thus the introverted ripping begins …

        So NRx is a formless anarchy telling the world how to put itself in
        order? Actually, I think this is probably right, and theoretically
        interesting, but it clearly needs thinking about. How can there
        imaginably be an ‘entryism’ threat when command control is a teeming
        chaos? What does this <em>example</em> of radical disorder suggest?

        <strong>Fission</strong> update — apparently the geniuses in the NRx
        peanut <a href="http://ask.fm/manissimov">gallery</a> are now convinced
        that Justine Tunney has usurped Michael Anissimov in his
        universally-acknowledged holy office as God-Emperor of the New Reaction.
        Anissimov, to his great credit, is bemused. Is this stuff going to burn
        out in its own radiant insanity, or amplify to some yet unimagined level
        of crazy? The responsible option would be to abandon the ship of fools
        now, but it’s way too entertaining for that. Signalling some distance is
        becoming absolutely imperative, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        One point that has to be emphasized with renewed fervor is the absolute
        priority of territorial fragmentation to any line of NRx discussion
        which begins to imagine itself ‘political’. Universalist models of the
        good society are entirely inconsistent with NRx at its foundations, and
        to turn such differences into political argument is to have wandered
        hopelessly off script. The whole point of neoreactionary social
        arrangements is to eliminate political argument, replacing it with
        practical problems of micro-migration. Facilitating homelands for one’s
        antagonists is even more important than designing them for one’s
        friends. (Even the old Republic of South Africa knew that — although it
        botched the execution.) Geographical sorting dispels dialectics.

        From what I have seen of the
        <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/">Transcendence</a></em>
        response, the movie has been almost universally misunderstood.
        Immodestly, I think my as-yet-unwritten blog post on the topic gets it
        with the title <em>Easter of the Nerds</em>. Idiotically, most reviewers
        describe it as being about the dangers of artificial super-intelligence.
        In reality, it’s about the human sin of fear and denial of God,
        culminating in the murder of the Messiah (as computationally-incarnated
        divinity), and his quiet return, in a garden, framing the entire picture
        in the promise of resurrection. It thus exposes Transhumanism not only
        as a Christian sub-clade, but as a remarkably conservative sub-clade
        (certainly in comparison to Mainline Protestantism). The significance of
        this needs exploring at some point …

        is going to continue happening, and to get more intense. The superficial
        cause is obvious, both Michael Anissimov and myself are extreme, twitchy
        ideologues, massively invested in NRx, with utterly divergent
        understandings of its implications. We both know this fight has to come,
        and that tactical timing is everything. (It’s really not personal, and I

        very easy for “the personal is political” to take a right-wing form.)

        to the far right, which yawns open across an anarcho-autocratic
        spectrum. Since a disinclination to moderation has already been
        indicated by anyone arriving at the far right fringe, it should scarcely
        be surprising when this same tendency rifts the far right itself. Then

        The strict <em>Outside in</em> complement to this would be something
        like:
        <em>disintegrative Social Darwinism through ruthless competition is what
          the Far Right is all about</em>. A formula of roughly this kind will inevitably come into play as the
        conflict evolves. Momentarily, though, I’m more interested in
        <em>situating</em> the clashes to come than <em>initiating</em> them.
        Whatever the contrary assertions — and they will come (doubtless from
        both sides) — the entire arena is located on the ultra-right, oriented
        vertically on the ideological space diagram, rather than horizontally
        (between positions whose primary differentiation is between the
        more-and-less right).
      </p>
      <p>
        Stated crudely, but I think reasonably
        accurately, the controversy polarizes <em>Neocameralism</em> against
        <em>Identitarian Community</em>. My suspicion is that Michael Anissimov
        will ultimately attenuate the Moldbuggian elements of his neoreactionary
        strain to the edge of disappearance, and that his hesitation about doing
        this rapidly is a matter of political strategy rather than philosophical
        commitment. From this ideological war, which he is conducting with
        obvious ability, he wants “Neoreaction” to end up with the people (or
        followers (who I don’t remotely care about)), whereas I want it to hold
        onto the Moldbug micro-tradition (which he sees as finally dispensable).
        The only thing that is really being scrapped over is the name, but we
        both think this semiotic real estate is of extraordinary value —
        although for very different reasons.

        While I deeply value intellectual engagement with the smartest of these
        “trads” I would consider it a complete victory if they were to abandon
        the NRx tag and re-brand themselves as Animissovites, or Neo-Evolans, or
        whatever, and depart in pursuit of a Monarcho-traditionalist homeland in
        Idaho. If NRx was socially reduced to a tenth (or less) of its size, but
        those remaining were Moldbuggian fundamentalists, working to refine the
        Neocameralist theoretical model for restraint of government through
        Patchwork Exit-dynamics, it would be strengthened immeasurably in all
        the ways that matter to this blog. It would also then simply be the case
        that media accusations of Neo-Feudal or White Nationalist romanticism —
        accompanied by ambitions for personal political power — were idiotic
        media slurs. Sadly, this cannot be said with total confidence as things
        stand.

        The Neocameralism campaign will almost certainly come first, but it is

        The commentator going by the tag Saddam Hussein’s Whirling Aluminium
        Tubes has produced some of the most brilliant criticism this blog has

          little bit. You’re classical liberals, it was just a little bit
          obscured because you are English classical liberals, rather than
          American or French ones. Hence the lack of interest in revolutions.

        <p>
          So, it’s your choice. You can certainly keep the neo-reactionary label
          and turn it into something like the “neo” in “neo-conservative” where
          “neo” means “pwned”. But that will mean that the traditionalist
          conservatives and WNs keep wandering in. Or you can cut the cord and
          complete the fission.

      </p>
      <p>
        If this really is a good-bye note, it’s the most magnificent example I
        have ever seen. I’m almost tempted to say, with enemies like this, who
        needs allies?

        There are twists and intricacies to be added to this stark cartography
        of schism, including those the schism will make to itself. From the
        current perspective of <em>Outside in</em> (which it of course suspects
        to be something else), the guideline to these is the complication of
        time through spiromorphism, or innovative restorations, which neither
        cycles nor simple escape trajectories can capture. These ultimately
        re-shape everything, but they can wait (while the wound creatively
        festers). Fission releases energy. Perhaps ironically — SHWAT has
        demonstrated that beyond all controversy.

      <h4 class="post-title">Race to the Bottom</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        As the foggiest two-thirds of ‘NRx’ continues its devolution into
        ENR-style ethno-socialism and activist voluntarism, it is inevitable
        that Europe’s populist ‘far right’ will increasingly be seized upon as a
        source of inspiration, and even as a model for emulation. This is, of
        course, an indication of degenerate insanity, and all the more to be
        expected on that account. On the positive side, the practical
        incompetence of ‘activist neoreaction’ will most probably spare it from
        the full measure of the embarrassment it is due. Nevertheless, whatever
        applause it offers to the vile antics of the European mob will not be
        soon forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be a distraction at this point to seek to distinguish the
        classical (Aristotelian) conception of <em>action</em> from the mire of
        modern political <em>activism</em>, or mass mobilization. That is the
        topic for another occasion. It suffices here to accept the integrated
        democratic understanding of popular activism for what it is, and to seek
        distance from it with unreserved disdain, under any convenient sign. If
        <em>passivism</em> makes this point, the suitability of the term is
        thereby ensured. The important thing is to make no contribution to the
        triumph of the mob and, secondarily, to draw no vicarious satisfaction
        from its advances.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be as clear as possible: What the ‘far right’ advance in Continental
        Europe represents is <em>a consummation of democratic morbidity</em>. It
        is nothing at all like a restoration. At best, it is what ‘hitting
        bottom’ is to an alcoholic — the crisis at the end of a deteriorating
        trend, after which something else can begin. (The bottom, it has to be
        noted, is a very long way down.)

          href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10868379/A-new-French-revolution-is-about-to-rip-apart-the-EU.html">Writing</a>
        in The Telegraph, Roger Bootle casts a cold eye upon the prospects for
        France:<br />
        <em>What is going to happen? I cannot see much prospect of France
          recovering to match Germany again without really fundamental reform –
          which French governments have traditionally been incapable of
          delivering. Accordingly, France will continue to decline relative to
          Germany. Interestingly, the recent beneficiary of French voters’
          protests, Marine Le Pen, does not want to open France up to more
          competition but rather to use withdrawal from the EU to strengthen the
          powers of the French state to overrule market forces. This does not
          bode well.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, far from being part of the hard northern core of the euro,
          France is increasingly coming to resemble the soft southern
          underbelly. Accordingly, for how much longer can the Franco-German
          “motor” continue to drive the EU? Won’t Germany increasingly realise
          its own strength and want to break free from its shackles to France?
          And won’t France increasingly resent the increased power of her
          neighbour?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don’t know how this is going to happen or when but I suspect that
          we are coming close to one of those periodic explosions that have
          shaped French history. When this happens the EU will never be the same
          again.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Europe is almost certainly going to complete its descent into Hell. It
        would be the ultimate condemnation of NRx — definitive proof that it had
        learnt nothing of value — if the specific shape of Europe’s damnation,
        as it reaches its nadir, were to be confused with a rightist ideal.

        of Marine Le Pen, edited irresponsibly into
        <strong>grossly misleading</strong> Cathedral-media nightmare fuel:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I want to destroy the EU … Europe is war. Economic war. It is the
          increase of hostilities between the countries. … The EU is deeply
          harmful, it is an anti-democratic monster. I want to prevent it from
          becoming fatter, from continuing to breathe, from grabbing everything
          with its paws and from extending its tentacles into all areas of our
          legislation. … A strong euro is ruining our economy. … It was created
          by Germany, for Germany. … the model we are advocating is less
          positive for Germany than the current model. Germany has become the
          economic heart of Europe because our leaders are weak. But Germany
          should never forget that France is Europe’s political heart. … Be
          careful Ms. Merkel. If you don’t see the suffering that has been
          imposed on the rest of the European people, then Germany will make
          itself hated. … she wants to impose her policies on others. This will
          lead to an explosion of the European Union. … If we don’t all leave
          the euro behind, it will explode. Either there will be a popular
          revolt because the people no longer want to be bled out. Or the
          Germans will say: Stop, we can’t pay for the poor anymore. … David
          Cameron says that </em><em>UKIP members are crazy and racist. I think it is good that UKIP is as
          strong as we are. … We have the same fundamental approach to Europe. …
          We used to be one of the richest countries in the world, but we are
          now on a path towards under-development. This austerity that has been
          imposed on the people doesn’t work. The people will not allow
          themselves to be throttled without revolting. … We need an intelligent
          protectionism. We need customs duties again … The problem is the total
          opening of borders and allowing the law of the jungle to prevail: The
          further a company goes today to find slaves, which it then treats like
          animals and pays a pittance, without regard for environmental laws,
          the more it earns. … I don’t want (Germany’s) Siemens to buy Alstom. I
          want Alstom to remain French. That is strategically important for my
          country’s independence. … One could nationalize a company, even if
          only temporarily, in order to stabilize it. … democracy is collapsing
          here in France. … I have a certain admiration for Vladimir Putin
          because he doesn’t allow decisions to be forced upon him by other
          countries. I think he focuses first and foremost on what is good for
          Russia and the Russians. … there are many things said about Russia
          because they have been demonized for years at the behest of the USA. …
          The Americans are trying to expand their influence in the world,
          particularly in Europe … defending their own interests, not ours.

        In an alternative universe, in which there was nobody except Michael
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/boundaries/">Anissimov</a> and me
        tussling over the identity of Neoreaction, I’d propose a distinction
        between ‘Inner-‘ and ‘Outer-Nrx’ as the most suitable axis of fission.
        Naturally, in this actual universe, such a dimension transects a rich
        fabric of nodes, tensions, and differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the inner faction, a firmly consolidated core identity is the
        central ambition. (It’s worth noting however that a so-far
        uninterrogated relation to
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/reconciling-transhumanismand-neoreaction/">transhumanism</a>
        seems no less problematic, in principle, than the vastly more fiercely
        contested relation to libertarianism has shown itself to be.) Inner-NRx,
        as a micro-culture, models itself on a protected state, in which
        belonging is sacred, and boundaries rigorously policed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outer-NRx, defined primarily by Exit, relates itself to what it escapes.
        It is refuge and periphery, more than a substitute core. It does not
        ever expect to rule anything at all (above the most microscopic level of
        social reality, and then under quite different names). The Patchwork is
        for it a set of options, and opportunities for leverage, rather than a
        menu of potential homes. It is intrinsically nomad, unsettled, and
        micro-agitational. Its culture consists of departures it does not
        regret. (While not remotely globalist, it is unmistakably cosmopolitan —
        with the understanding that the ‘cosmos’ consists of chances to split.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Outer-NRx tends to like libertarians, at least
        <a href="http://www.caseyresearch.com/lg/meltdown-video">those</a> of a
        hard-right persuasion, and the gateway that has enabled it to be outside
        libertarianism is the ideological zone to which it gravitates. Leaving
        libertarianism (rightwards) has made it what it is, and continues to
        nourish it. ‘Entryism’ — as has been frequently noted — is not a
        significant anxiety for Outer-NRx, but far more of a stimulation and, at
        its most acute, a welcome intellectual provocation. It is not the dodgy

        NRx, across its whole spectrum, is neither libertarian nor fascist.
        There is, however, a remarkable polarity — our axis of fission — which
        is based upon which of these associations is found most disreputable.
        From my perspective, this distinction lines up extremely neatly with
        Alexander Dugin’s Hyperborean / Atlantean continental forever war. It
        seems to me beyond any serious question that the inheritance from
        Mencius Moldbug lies unproblematically on the Atlantean side of this
        divide. The standing <em>Outside in</em>
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/2014-a-prophecy/">prophecy</a> is
        that, by the end of this year, a definitive break along these lines will
        have taken place. There’s no reason I can see to back-track on that
        expectation.

        <em>… the paradox of nationalism is that the same forces that led to its

        Nationalism is the one modern progressive ideology that gets off the
        hook far too easily in NRx circles. (And “what is to be done?” is
        Lenin’s
        <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/">question</a>, adopted from

    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trike-lines/">
      <h4 class="post-title">Trike Lines</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Michael Anissimov has been conducting an online
        <a href="http://strawpoll.me/2637324">poll</a> of NRx affinities. While
        questions of principle and method might have delayed this experiment,
        such procrastination would have been a mistake. The results have already
        contributed significant information. Most obviously (as already widely
        noted) the pattern of primary allegiance to the the different
        trike-tendencies is far more evenly balanced than many had expected. As
        an intellectual theme — and now as a demonstrated distribution — the
        ‘Spandrellian Trichotomy’ shows a remarkably resilient
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomy/">stability</a>. The
        integral pluralism of NRx is becoming impossible to sideline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nyan Sandwich has posted a Trike-theory
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/neoreaction-is-analytic-rightward-synthesis/">response</a>
        at <em>More Right</em>. While ultimately skeptical about the pluralist
        interpretation of the Trichotomy, the order of his argument respects it
        as a primary phenomenon. Nyan is among
        <a href="https://twitter.com/soapjackal">those</a> who expect NRx to
        incline to a concentrated synthesis, or compact unity — superseding its
        distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thus it doesn’t really make sense to ask what branch of NRx one
          identifies with. It’s like asking a physicist whether they think
          quantum mechanics or general relativity is more true. The point is
          that the truth is a synthesis of the component theories, not a
          disjunction.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The natural counter-position to this would be a defense of irreducibly
        plural integrity, or <em>operational disunity</em>. The lines of
        controversy released here do not correspond to Trike ‘branches’ but cut
        across them, and through a number of critical topics, certainly
        including:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) The existence of irreducible triangular schemas within all of the
        world’s great civilizations, represented within the Christian West by
        trinitarian theology. How is the relation between the triad and the
        monad to be conceived? Does this relation vary fundamentally between
        world cultures? (These decidedly pre-NRx
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/reign-of-the-tripod/">remarks</a> seem
        very old now, but they remain at least suggestively relevant.)
        <a href="http://www.hinduism.co.za/sattwa,.htm">This</a> is the
        principal Hindu articulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) To what extent is NRx inherently critical of structurally (rather
        than demotically)
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomocracy/">divided</a>
        powers? (Among the ironies of any consensual NRx commitment to
        <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Absolute_monarchy.html">absolute</a>
        monarchy would be its radical anti-feudalism, or proto-modernism.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The techno-rationalist aspiration to a super-intelligent ‘<a
          href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html">Singleton</a>‘ clearly assumes suppression of sovereign
        plurality. This fully
        suffices to graft the NRx controversy into the moral-political and
        theoretical debates over (Right)
        <a href="http://hedweb.com/intelligence-explosion/index.html">Singularity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of fact, there is scarcely anything NRx agrees upon more
        consistently than the structure of its disagreements. There are three
        basic (dyadic) conflicts implicit within the Trichotomy, of which only
        one has — to this point — been seriously initiated. (Our ‘Theonomists’
        have yet to get scrappy.) Much turmoil still lies ahead.

        racial identitarians at the moment (some links
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chaos-patch-31/">here</a>), which
        makes the civility and intelligence of
        <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2014/10/15/724/">these</a> remarks
        all the more notable. (For this blog, the
        <em>Social Matter</em> discussion was a reminder of the — similarly
        civilized — exchange with Matt Parrott that took place in the comment
        thread <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/white-out/">here</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In case anyone is somehow unclear about the quality of the neighborhood
        White Nationalism finds itself in, or adjacent to, it’s worth a brief
        composite citation from the Andrew Anglin post cited above:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You [Colin Liddell] agree with Jewish agendas, which is why you would
          wish to obfuscate the fact that Jews are responsible for everything by
          claiming we shouldn’t blame the Jews for our problems. … The reason
          these two [CL plus Greg Johnson] are on the same side against me is
          that they share the quality that they have no interest in a popular
          movement, and despise anyone who would attempt to take that route. … I
          am, unashamedly, a populist. Every successful revolutionary movement
          in history has been populist in nature … Hitler was a populist.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        While I have to confess to finding Anglin entertaining, I hope it goes
        without saying that this kind of thinking has nothing at all to do with
        NRx. In fact, revolutionary populism almost perfectly captures what
        Neoreaction is not. NRx is notoriously fissiparous, but on the gulf
        dividing all its variants from racial Jacobinism there can surely be no
        controversy. So the barking you can hear in the background serves as
        necessary context. (This does not count as an objection to the Neo-Nazis
        acquiring their own state, since that would make it even easier not to
        live among them than it is already. Unfortunately, it is not easy to
        imagine the separatist negotiations going smoothly.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Because everything further to be said on
        this topic is complicated, I’m restricting my ambitions here to a series
        of discussion points, roughly sketched:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) NRx diversity conflicts are considerably less heated than those
        presently gripping the WNs, in part — no doubt — because the immediate
        political stakes are even smaller. It nevertheless introduces a
        massively complicating factor. For those (not exclusively found in the
        Tech-Comm camp, but I suspect concentrated there) who consider
        <strong>Moldbug</strong>‘s work canonical, the distinction between NRx
        and White
        <a
          href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html">Nationalism</a>
        (as also
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/06/why-i-am-not-anti-semite.html">antisemitism</a>)
        is
        already quite clearly defined. Among those of a predominantly
        Eth-Nat. inclination, on the other hand, far more border-blurriness
        exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) The relationship between White Nationalism and
        <strong>HBD</strong> is also complex. From outside, the two are
        regularly conflated, but this is a crude error. The zone of intersection
        — exemplified by Frank
        <a href="http://www.eurocanadian.ca/2014/07/right-and-left-globalism.html">Salter</a>
        (and perhaps Kevin
        <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/author/kmac/">MacDonald</a>) — is characterized by a concern
        with
        ethnic genetic interests, but
        this is by no means an axiomatic theoretical or practical commitment
        among HBD bloggers. More typically, HBD-orientation is associated with
        cosmopolitan spirit of scientific neutrality, meritocratic elitism, and
        a suspicion of the deleterious consequences of inbreeding, often
        accompanied by a tendency to philosemitism and sinophilia. Racial
        solidarity does not follow necessarily from biorealism, but requires an
        extraneous political impulse. Whatever connection is forged between WN
        and HBD owes more to their common opposition to the West’s dominant
        Lysenkoism and Leftist (blank-slate, victimological) race politics than
        to any firm internal bond.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The triangular linkages between NRX, WN, and
        <strong>libertarianism</strong> are also intricate. Consider this
        (fascinating)
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFLW4-gwBU&amp;feature=youtu.be">talk</a>
        by Richard Spencer, to a libertarian audience, for a quick sense of the
        territory being navigated. The moment of dark enlightenment for
        libertarians tends to accompany the recognition that the cultural
        foundations of <em>laissez-faire</em> social arrangements have an
        extreme ‘ethnic’ specificity. This accommodation of right libertarians
        to neoreactionary ideas is not associated with a comparable
        approximation to White Nationalism, however, since the very ethnic
        characteristics being accentuated — the high-trust cosmopolitan openness
        of strongly outbred populations — are exactly those provoking WN despair
        as the roots of pathological
        <a href="http://www.amren.com/features/2012/07/pathological-altruism/">altruism</a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-on-the-roots-of-white-ethnomasochism">ethnomasochism</a>.
        (This is a ruinous paradox basic to the relevant
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/white-fright/">ruminations</a>
        here.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) A closely-connected problem is that of cutting ethnies at the
        joints. (Within NRx, this is the
        <a href="http://theden.tv/">thede</a> topic.) While there are no doubt
        some neoreactionaries comfortable with the category of ‘whites’ as a
        positive <strong>thede</strong>, for others it seems far too broad —
        whether due to its inconsistency within any historical nation, its
        amalgamation of populations culturally divided by the Hajnal
        <a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/big-summary-post-on-the-hajnal-line/">line</a>, its
        aggregation
        across relatively hard
        <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mgf2j/irish.html">regional</a>,
        <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/">class</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.keynesatharvard.org/book/KeynesatHarvard-ch01.html">ideological</a>
        divisions, or generally because — almost without exception — the most
        bitter and ruthless enemy of any given group of white people has been
        another group of white people. When WNs
        <a href="http://www.amren.com/features/2014/10/towards-a-world-brotherhood-of-europeans/">speak</a>
        of a ‘World Brotherhood of Europeans’ it strikes most neoreactionaries
        (I suspect) as scarcely less comical than an appeal for universal human
        brotherhood, since it blithely encompasses the most vicious and
        ineliminable antagonisms in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) Finally (for now) there’s the relation of NRx to the
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/European_New_Right/">ENR</a> — already
        a grating concern, and (since the <strong>ENR</strong> is
        <em>also</em> already highly diverse) beyond the scope of anything but
        the most glancing treatment. From the perspective of this blog, the most
        aggravating figure is
        <a href="http://ihr.org/jhr/v14/v14n2p28_Warren.html">undoubtedly</a>
        Alain de Benoist — whose brilliance is directed towards the most radical
        articulation of anti-capitalism to be found anywhere outside the Marxist
        tradition (and even within it). NRx Tech-Comms have the same level of
        sympathy for such ideas as they do for the legacy of Saloth Sar or Hugo
        Chavez, and insofar as they are proposed as an element of a potential
        coalition, the enterprise is immediately collapsed to a farce. This
        touches upon the wider concern that WN thinking often appears to skirt,
        and on occasions to overtly embrace, a simple racial socialism and thus
        by some definitions reduce to a leftist — even extreme leftist —
        ideology. Seen from <em>Outside in</em>, there are far superior
        prospects to be found in the realist darkening of right libertarians
        than in coalition-building with clear-eyed collectivists.
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) Things we can <strong>agree</strong> upon without much difficulty:
        The dominant power structure is racially obsessed and
        (schizophrenically) committed to the effacement of all racial reality;
        racial differences have substantial social consequences; the native
        populations of historically white societies are being subjected to an
        ideological (and criminal) onslaught of deranged intensity; the legal
        concept of ‘disparate impact’ is fundamentally corrupt; universal
        prescriptions for the social, political, cultural, and economic
        arrangements of diverse groups are doomed to failure; ethnic separatism
        (of any kind) is a legitimate political aspiration; free association and
        freedom of conscience are principles to be unconditionally defended;
        science is not answerable to ideology; … this list could no doubt be
        extended. (I am more uncertain about whether there is anything here that
        either NRxers or WNs would want to deduct.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly, and in general, there is much more to be said about all of
        this, with every reason for confidence that it will be said.

        We’re not talking about another 20 years before the purely environmental
        position is discredited, but probably less than a decade. What happens
        when a linchpin of political correctness becomes scientifically
        untenable? It should be interesting to watch. I confess to a problem

        If NRx is spiraling back into a second phase of entryism paranoia, it
        looks as if it might be a lot more reflexively intense — and therefore
        more creative — than the

        one. It’s still too early to get a firm grip at this point, and it is
        quite possible that the very nature of the threat makes confident
        apprehension an unrealistic expectation. Subversion is an abstract
        horror, or integral obscurity, presumed to be actively restraining
        itself from emergence as a phenomenon. However, some stimulating

        Much entertainment in store — and perhaps even some functional ideas —
        if we can avoid going entirely insane. After all, the last wave of
        involutionary paranoia brought us some valuable thoughts (among which
        the best were probably

        probably missed some critical moments, where attempts at
        institutional self-immunization became productive, and experimental.
        Keeping social maneuvers virtual helps to ward off incontinent public
        activism, so any opportunity to experiment with Machiavellian
        micro-politics is worth seizing with dark glee.

        It’s far less an ideological difference, than a difference over
        <em>the importance of ideology</em>. It’s also a matter of thede, rather
        <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/thedes-and-phyles/">than</a>
        phyle (I’m assuming). The initial, obvious, and somewhat disconcerting
        implication is that nothing is going to be shifted anywhere significant
        by ideological maneuvers. NRx and Rx will each attract their core
        constituencies, after which there’s only pointless bickering. On the
        positive side, there’s <em>our</em> work to do …

        The heated
        <a href="http://www.mattridley.co.uk/blog/ants,-altruism-and-self-sacrifice.aspx">controversy</a>
        running through biology right now — pronounced, at least, in its zone of
        intersection with the wider public sphere — seems like something that
        should be inciting fission within the NRx. The collision between
        Hamiltonian kin selection (defended most prominently in this case by
        Richard Dawkins) and group selection (E. O. Wilson) drives a wedge
        between the baseline biorealism accepted by all tendencies within the
        Neoreactionary
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomy/">Trike</a> and the much
        stronger version of racial identitarianism that flourishes within the
        ethno-nationalist faction. Until recent times, proto-Hamiltonian
        hereditarianism has been strongly aligned with classical liberalism,
        while ideological racial collectivism represents a later — and very
        different — political tradition. Not so much as a chirp yet, though. Are
        people unpersuaded about this argument’s relevance?
      </p>
      <p>
        On a slight tangent (but ultimately, only a slight one) Nick Szabo’s
        epically brilliant
        <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">essay</a> ‘Shelling
        Out’ is remarkable — among other things — for its profound biorealist
        foundations. It makes an excellent theoretical preparation for Jim’s
        <a href="http://jim.com/rights.html">paper</a> on ‘Natural Law and
        Natural Rights’, which also draws productively upon John Maynard Smith’s
        game-theoretic model of the ‘evolutionary stable strategy’ as the
        natural substrate of psychological and cultural deep-structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an important opportunity to put down some discriminatory
        markers. Can we turf group selectionist ideas out of NRx entirely, or do
        we have to fight about it?

        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>I was rather hoping we might continue our little chat about the
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/deep-state/">Deep</a> State.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>Terrific! That’s a topic close to my heart, as you know. Those
          slithering parasites hidden beneath the rotten log of the Cathedral.
          It’s time to expose them, denounce them, burn them out!</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>They’re the enemy then?</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>Of course they’re the enemy! They run the Cathedral, don’t they? Try
          not to sophisticate matters beyond all common sense.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>Did you find time to take a look at that little Daniel Krawisz
          <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoins-shroud-of-subtlety-and-allure/">article</a>

        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>Yes, it was vaguely interesting, I suppose.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>So you didn’t like it much?</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>Frankly Crypton, it reminded me of the side of you I like least, and
          having downed a few horns of ale, I’ll be double frank — it had a
          whiff of … well … <strong>treachery</strong> about it. To spend so
          much attention upon the subtleties of potential defections, it’s
          unmanly, somehow.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>That’s excellent Populo, because I was going to suggest that
          gaming-out Deep State defections is the
          <strong>only</strong> practical strategic topic worthy of NRx
          consideration. It seems that we have our conversation plotted for
          us.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>Agreed, a fine joust! But let me start by telling you something about
          yourself Crypton, which I’m not sure you clearly see.
          <strong>Ironically</strong>, as you would no doubt say, your
          attraction to this shadowy topic is driven by psychological
          motivations that are as bright as a beacon. It’s clandestine, by
          nature, and therefore necessarily passes into ellipsis. That makes it
          an excuse for abstraction. Squalid actuality is unmentionable, so that
          the conversation is steered inevitably into the virtual. In other
          words, it tends by subterranean design to be a flight from action.
          That’s perfect for me, of course, because by crushing you in this
          argument through unimagined neutronium-densities of humiliation, I
          will be serving the noble cause of public resistance, implicitly, even
          though that’s the last thing you want to talk about. So make your
          case.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>Maximally compressed it’s this — in the near future, only
          crypto-conflict is serious. Public politics is purely for the popcorn
          industry.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>So we’re already diving under the rotting log?</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>If that’s your preferred image.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>And beside these occult transactions, nothing matters?</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>Precisely.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>But then, by the very nature of the thing, we have no idea what we’re
          doing, or who we’re trying to communicate with. We have nothing to
          offer them. We don’t even know whether they exist … Oh do stop it
          Crypton, your eyes are gleaming.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:

        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>OK.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>You’re proposing some kind of cryptic alliance with them — or
          elements within them — or you’re not proposing anything at all.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>: <em>Fair. At least, that’s part of it.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>: <em>And the rest of it?</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>You know I’m a skeptic on enumerative methods.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>: <em>Some of it, then.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>It seems impossible that the AAs could know what they ultimately are,
          teleologically — what they are becoming. These organizations include
          some very smart people, with a taste for puzzles. Is it likely they
          could not be intrigued by their institutional destiny?</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>As usual, I have no idea at all what you’re suggesting.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>There is a properly <strong>cryptic</strong> plane of communication
          with the Deep State, that does not conform to the political plaintext
          of conspiratorial engagement. It concerns the keys of fate.
          Concretely, there is an implicit alliance around the escalation of
          cryptographic technology — as also, one even more implicitly against
          it, and against the AAs <strong>as such</strong>, on those fundamental
          grounds. If crypsis — camouflage — is a <strong>hidden end</strong>,
          and not merely — as it superficially appears — a means to the
          fulfillment of vulgar or exoteric goals, then the pact is sealed
          somewhere outside the AAs themselves. The AAs have an occult cosmic
          purpose, far exceeding their national security functions. Not that
          these latter are uninteresting …</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>: <em>So let’s, please, talk about them.</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>If there’s any place in the social structure where such matters are
          entirely detached from questions of demotic ideological legitimation,
          popular politics, or even merely public relations, it has surely to be
          the Deep State. Is the Deep State, then, in this regard, not already a
          model of Exit? It has departed the public political sphere, for the
          shadows, at least, if it has managed to obtain the operational liberty
          from democratic accountability, of which its critics so vociferously
          accuse it.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:
        <em>You don’t think the NSA has diversity monitors?</em><br />
        <strong>Crypton</strong>:
        <em>If it has, America deserves to perish, and it’s our task to explain
          why.</em><br />
        <strong>Populo</strong>:

      <h4 class="post-title">#HRx</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>The basic tenets of Heroic Reaction:</p>
      <p>
        — Moldbug is over-rated.<br />
        — Capitalism needs to be brought under control.<br />
        — The errors of fascism are dwarfed by those of libertarianism.<br />
        — White racial community is the core.<br />
        — ‘Atomization’ is a serious problem.<br />
        — Answers are already easily available, so over-thinking is unhelpful,
        and even seriously pathological.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike #NRx, #HRx is primarily a <em>political movement</em>. Its
        theoretical appetite is modest, since it has faith that everything it
        truly needs can be retrieved — more-or-less straightforwardly — from the
        folkish past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the many myriads confusedly aligned with ‘Neoreaction’, a number
        have already expressed an explicit interest in abandoning this odd cult
        for a bolder, brasher, more politically dynamic successor, stripped of
        techno-commercial Vulcanism, race-treachery, and intellectual
        circumlocution. Far more would join the exodus (from #NRx) if
        energetically led. Others would pour in from elsewhere. All #HRx still
        requires is a <em>commander</em>. Then it could be huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the moment #HRx is born, the scale of (apparent) #NRx would shrink
        dramatically. That is an outcome, I suspect, that could be endured among
        the remnant with serene stoicism.

        <a href="https://froudesociety.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/hrx-takes-its-exit/">This</a>
        is well-done, insightful, and even comparatively civil.
      </p>
      <p>The diremption:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Moldbug, by laying an
          <a href="http://moldbuggery.blogspot.hk/">immense foundation</a>, was
          complex enough to be interpreted in very distinct manners. NRx
          concentrates on his economic writings and proposed solutions:
          stockholder sovereigns, Patchwork, block-chain protocols, exit,
          financial incentives, Austrianism, [Bitcoin], ‘the reset’.
          Alternatively, HRx concentrates on his reading suggestions and
          historical/international writings: Carly[l]e worship,
          high-Toryism/Jacobitism, classical international law, Absolute
          monarchy, generalist historiography, imperialism apologia, political
          theory, and the general aesthetic. It’s fair enough to say that
          neither side is willing to embrace the whole package; unless Mencius
          comes back and picks a side we’re going to keep on squabbling over who
          are his true followers. Regardless, we all agree on MM’s critiques of
          Democracy, bureaucracy, progressive morality, and the dominant
          institutions. […] I believe this dichotomy is fundamentally spiritual.
          NRx is a materialist ideology, post-Ancap in essence, it’s no surprise
          then that many Neoreactionaries started out as Marxists or
          Libertarians. Conversely, HRx places the metaphysical at the root of
          all civic affairs. With raw power politics also superseding
          catallaxy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not quibble proof, from the XS PoV, but it’s far closer to a cold,
        realistic assessment than
        <a href="https://reactionaryfuture.wordpress.com/">anything</a> we’ve
        seen yet. (It’s impossible for me to avoid observing, in passing, that
        the descent into spittle-flecked vulgarity seems to be a distinguishing
        characteristic of these ‘higher souls’. Is it too much to ask for just a
        little loftiness of tone from our political metaphysicians? Quite apart
        from anything else, it would actually work better.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other points of interest in the Froude Society piece.
        Worth noting in particular:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They reject the hero, they reject the sublime, and thus any exoteric
          link to the Holy on High. Moreover, they do not even pretend to have
          any solutions for non anglo-civilizations, we speak truths that ring
          true for all peoples by historical precedent, that good governance and
          order is always Good.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It wouldn’t surprise me, in the least, if the author of
        <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> would tilt more to the HRx camp today
        (although, rather weirdly, the
        <em><a href="http://urbit.org/docs/theory/network-goals">Urbit</a></em>
        innovator seems to have pushed even further into ‘protocol’ territory).
        There is certainly no assertion on our (Tech-Comm) side, that he would
        subscribe to the usage of his work that we find important. Nor do we, to
        any serious extent, care whether he would do so. Neocameral-Patchwork
        formalism, the theorization of fungible primary (sovereign) property,
        and Exit-oriented geopolitical disintegration is the commitment we have
        here — and without Moldbug none of that would have reached its present
        state of articulation. The Jacobitism, monarchist theater, objective
        Anglophobia, ahistorical contempt for emergent trustless governance
        systems, hyperbolic anti-modernism, and romantic humanism we can do
        without.

          are two types of civilization – the civilization of Sea (Seapower) and
          the civilization of Land (Landpower). They are constructed on opposite
          systems of values. While Seapower is purely mercantile, modernist, and
          materialist, Landpower is traditionalist, spiritual, and heroic. This
          dualism corresponds to Werner Sombart’s conceptual pair of Händlres
          and Helden. Modern European society is fully integrated into the
          civilization of Sea which manifests itself in the strategic hegemony
          of North America and NATO.</em>

        The Hyperborean agenda: “We need to combat liberalism, refuse it, and
        deconstruct it entirely. At the same time, we need to do so not in the
        name of just class (as in Marxism) or in the name of the nation or race
        (as in fascism), but in the name of the organic unity of the people,
        social justice, and real democracy.”

        Purge Atlanteanism (“Seapower”) of all that, through intensified
        polarization, and it generates NeoCam Patchwork automatically. Space is

        As XS readers are most probably already aware, there’s an extremely
        intriguing <em>experiment in authority</em> taking place within the
        shadowy halls of NRx right now. The principal document, released by the
        Hestia Society, can be found
        <a href="http://www.hestiasociety.org/site/about/official-statement-on-the-leadership-of-nrx/">here</a>. It is
        succinct, sane, and merits careful digestion. Associated
        re-adjustments are noted in
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/announcing-the-future-primaeval/">this</a>
        <em>More Right</em> post, announcing a new home for “the Rationalist
        branch of NRx”, <a href="http://thefutureprimaeval.net/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of a formal foundation of sovereign property, a putsch is
        an entirely unobjectionable mechanism for the transfer — and in this
        case, more accurately, initial establishment — of social authority. The
        new inner council has been remarkably well-selected for sobriety and
        judgment (i.e., for what, in the English political parlance, is known as
        ‘bottom’). In both psychological and ideological respects, it incarnates
        a promise of sound government. The occasion for this development, as
        explained in the HS statement, is worth repeating here, due to the
        commendable lucidity of its diagnosis:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It’s become clear over the past year (mid 2014 to mid 2015) that
          “Neoreaction” is suffering a tragedy of the commons and lack of formal
          structure. Because no one has formally owned the #NRx brand, there
          have been a lot of territorial skirmishes, confusion about who’s in,
          who’s out, and who’s in charge, disruption of the interesting
          theoretical work, and bad behaviour lasting months or years that
          wouldn’t last days in a serious organization.</em>

        There are a great many, very interesting, <em>theoretical</em> questions
        remaining about the viability of any authoritative institution in the
        absence of definite disciplinary mechanisms. This blog will certainly be
        delving into such problems, in future posts. For the moment, however,
        something approximating closely to a declaration of fealty seems
        appropriate. From the <em>Xenosystems</em> perspective, the NRx brand
        has never been entrusted to safer hands.

        an example of the distinction being used in a discussion between
        libertarians. It would be surprising if the distinction lacked useful
        application to NRx controversies. It goes without saying (I’m assuming)
        that the NAP wouldn’t serve as the ultimate, irreducible axiom in that

        ‘Privatization’ isn’t a bad compression of this principle. The case for

        enveloped by it.

    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/nrx-and-liberalism/">
      <h4 class="post-title">NRx and Liberalism</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        In much of the neoreactionary camp, ‘liberalism’ is the end-point of
        discussion. Its argumentative function is <em>exactly</em> that of
        ‘racism’ for the left. The only question, as far as this stance is
        concerned, is whether the term can be made to stick. Once the scarlet
        letter of micro-cultural ostracism is attached, there’s nothing further
        to discuss. This is unlikely to change, except at the margin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obvious preliminary to this topic is, if not quite ‘American
        English’, something like it. ‘Liberalism’ in the American tongue has
        arrived in a strange space, unique to that continent. It is notable, and
        uncontroversial, for instance that the notion of a ‘right-wing liberal’
        is considered a straight oxymoron by American speakers, where in Europe
        — and especially mainland Europe — it is closer to a pleonasm. Since we
        still, to a very considerable extent, inhabit an American world, the
        expanded term ‘classical liberal’ is now required to convey the
        traditional sense. A Briton, of capitalistic inclinations, is likely to
        favor ‘Manchester Liberal’ for its historical associations with the
        explicit ideology of industrial revolution. In any case, the discussion
        has been unquestionably complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Political language tends to become dialectical, in the most depraved
        (Hegelian) sense of this term. It lurches wildly into its opposite, as
        it is switched like a contested flag between conflicting parties. Stable
        political significances apply only to whatever the left (the
        ‘opposition’, or ‘resistance’) hasn’t touched yet. Another
        consideration, then, for those disposed to a naive faith in ideological
        signs as heraldic markers. (It is one that threatens to divert this post
        into excessive digression, and is thus to be left — in
        <em>Wikipedia</em> language — as a ‘stub’.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposal of this blog is to situate ‘liberal’ at the intersection of
        three terms, each essential to any recoverable, culturally tenacious
        meaning. It is irreducibly <em>modern</em>, <em>English</em>, and
        <em>counter-political</em>. ‘Ancient liberties’ are at least imaginable,
        but an ancient liberalism is not. Foreign liberalisms can be wished the
        best of luck, because they will most certainly need it (an exception for
        the Dutch, alone, is plausible here). Political liberalism is from the
        beginning a practical paradox, although perhaps in certain rare cases
        one worth pursuing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burke is, without serious room for doubt, a
        liberal in this sense. He is even its epitomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The positive content of this liberalism is the non-state culture of
        (early) English modernism, as represented (with some modicum of ethnic
        irony) by the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, by the tradition
        of spontaneous order in its Anglophone lineage, by the conception of
        commercial society as <em>relief from politics</em>, and by
        (‘Darwinian’) naturalistic approaches that position distributed,
        competitive dynamism as an ultimate explanatory and genetic principle.
        This is the cultural foundation that made English the common tongue of
        global modernity (as has been widely
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-224/">noted</a>). In
        political economy, its supreme principle is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallaxy">catallaxy</a> (and
        only very conditionally, monarchy).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is from this cultural matrix that Peter Thiel speaks, when he
        <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian">says</a>
        (notoriously):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Democracy is criticized <em>from the perspective of</em> (the old)
        <em>liberalism</em>. The insight is perfectly (if no doubt incompletely)
        <a
          href="http://www.riosmauricio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hoppe_Democracy_The_God_That_Failed.pdf">Hoppean</a>.
        It is a break that prepared many (the author of this blog included)
        for Moldbug, and structured his reception. It also set limits. Democracy
        is denounced, fundamentally, for its betrayal of Anglo-Modernist
        liberty. Hoppe’s
        <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hans-Hermann_Hoppe">formulation</a>
        cannot be improved upon:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Democracy has nothing to do with freedom. Democracy is a soft variant
          of communism, and rarely in the history of ideas has it been taken for
          anything else.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug’s explicit comments on this point are remarkably consistent, but
        not without ambiguity. He
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2009/05/democraphobia-goes-slightly-viral.html">writes</a>
        (I contend, <em>typically</em>):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The truth about “libertarianism” is that,
          <strong>in general</strong>, although sovereignty is sovereignty, the
          sovereign whether man, woman or committee is above the law by
          definition, and there is no formula or science of government,
          libertarian policies tend to be good ones. Nor did we need Hayek to
          tell us this. It was known to my namesake, over two millennia ago.</em>
        […]<em>
          <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">Wu wei</a></strong>
          – for this is its true name – is a public policy for a virtuous
          prince, not a gigantic committee. The virtuous prince should practice
          <strong>wu wei</strong>, and will; that is his nature. Men will flock
          to his kingdom and prosper there. The evil prince will commit
          atrocities; that is his nature. Men will flee his kingdom, and should
          do so ASAP before he gets the minefields in.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this flocking and fleeing to be conceptually <em>subordinated</em> to
        the analysis of sovereignty, or — in contrast (and in the way of
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cnut-the-great/">Cnut</a> the Great)
        — set above it, as the Mandate of Heaven above the Emperor, which is to
        say: as the enveloping context of external relations, grounded only in
        the Outside? Despite anticipated accusations of bad faith, this is a
        serious question, and one that cannot be plausibly considered simply
        exterior to Moldbug’s work and thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, it is the lineage of English Liberty (and beyond it,
        <em>Wu wei</em>, or the Mandate of Heaven) that commands our loyalty
        here. Insofar as Moldbug contributes to that, he is an ally, otherwise a
        foe, the brilliance and immense stimulation of his corpus
        notwithstanding. NRx, as it now exists, similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “… the State should not be managing the minds of its citizens”
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2007/09/is-journalism-official.html">writes</a>
        Moldbug. (That’s actually a little <em>more</em> moralistic — in an
        admirably liberal direction — than I’m altogether comfortable with.)

        quite definite that the maniac who murdered this lady was some kind of
        riled-up Neo-Nazi (with mental health problems, if that isn’t a
        pleonasm). The SPLC is being called upon to pitch in with information,
        <em>wholly understandably and predictably</em>.
      </p>
      <p>The news article notes:</p>
      <p>
        <em>In the wake of the attack, commentators questioned whether the tone
          of the ongoing Brexit referendum on Britain’s future in the European
          Union referendum campaign had been too divisive, pointing in
          particular to the focus on immigration. […] Alex Massie, writing in
          the Spectator magazine, blamed the “Leave” campaign for raising
          tensions. […] “When you encourage rage you cannot then feign surprise
          when people become enraged,” Mr Massie wrote. […] “When you present
          politics as a matter of life and death, as a question of national
          survival, don’t be surprised if someone takes you at your word.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s absolutely no point insisting that this is bullshit, because to
        the extent that it is
        <em>it’s nevertheless inevitable, and it will certainly be effective</em>. This is what incontinent activism
        produces. It’s free, super-charged
        propaganda for the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Right succeeds at making anything out of the collapse of the
        reigning order, it will be because it has
        <a href="http://thefutureprimaeval.net/passivism-and-the-procedure/">pacified</a>
        its own fringe of lunatic activism. It’s far from clear that it’s
        capable of doing that. What is clear though, is that the Alt-Right
        tendency — taken generally — is not anywhere close to seriously trying.
        The idiots pretending to be your friends will hurt you far more than the
        idiots on the other side. Mere survival requires principled dissociation
        from anyone promoting crime and terror as political tactics. Violent
        criminality is not even slightly OK. (It’s questionable whether politics
        is even slightly OK.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If “no enemies on the right” moderates condemnation of rabid animals,
        it’s a formula for political suicide.

        Breivik, cutting to the core of the right-wing activist delusion:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A restoration of traditional, pre-liberal or even pre-Christian
          Norway is a herculean task of social and political engineering. It
          cannot possibly be carried on without absolute sovereignty. Indeed,
          the task of eradicating liberal institutions and liberal culture in
          Norway, though tremendous (and itself requiring absolute sovereignty),
          pales before the much more difficult task of recreating a genuine
          Norwegian society that isn’t a ridiculous theme-park joke. […] The
          idea that <strong>any</strong> incremental political change, achieved
          by <strong>any</strong> sort of “activism” (from mass whining to mass

        Of course, very few are capable of doing anything positively valuable,

        ‘Absolutist neoreaction’ seems to think its techno-commercialist enemies

          structures.</em>

        If there is some determined attempt to separate Power™ from

      <p>
        To ignore the historical association of power disintegration with the
        emergence of self-propelling techonomic competences also looks like a
        serious blindness. Capitalism hatched in Europe because Europe was
        broken. Keeping the world broken seems similarly indissociable from the
        survival of capitalistic historical momentum, and breaking it more
        profoundly is the route to capital intensification. Perhaps that’s the
        argument we’re having (not that such arguments matter much).

            epistemology</a>” which denies a place for sources of knowledge outside of
          “irreducible and untranscendable reason,” 2) his Bodinian (and
          ultimately Roman) conception of sovereignty, and 3) his
          Machiavellianism and frequent resort to

      <p>
        Many of the recent
        <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/internet-sovereignty/">short</a>
        <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/confucius-institutes/">posts</a> here
        have been inter-connected by the topic of international ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power">soft
          power</a>‘ tensions. Somewhat ironically, this is a subject that is peculiarly
        prone to failures of insight. No cultural formation is disposed to a
        self-understanding that would expose itself as something inherently
        threatening.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reactions of Western academic, media, entertainment, and ancillary
        cultural powers to Chinese resistances and counter-actions are
        characterized by a remarkable uniformity, and systematic refusal of
        reflection. Doesn’t any obstruction of — or non-compliance with — these
        highly-internationalized forces of communication indicate simple
        <em>fear of the truth</em>? That is overwhelmingly the core assumption,
        when such matters are discussed by those very organs of trans-cultural
        agency which should be in question, but which manage very successfully
        not to be. The ‘conversation’ is almost wholly controlled by those who
        would be the topic of the conversation, if the conversation were
        permitted to happen.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In this respect, the international
        <em>managed non-controversy</em> closely echoes the domestic cultural
        cold war in the United States. When one side in such a conflict claims
        to be the incontestable authority on the nature of the conflict, the
        history books are written by the victors before the history has even
        taken place. Resistance to the cultural hegemon is predetermined as
        inarticulate, unreasonable, and illegitimate. Assertions of academic and
        media ‘freedom’ are substituted for positive analyses of cultural powers
        and their agendas, as if the very suspicion of concerted strategic
        influence were self-evidently nonsensical, and reasonably pathologized
        as paranoid conspiracy theorizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It becomes irresistible, therefore, to present
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nydwracu">Nydrwracu</a>‘s diagram of
        American domestic cultural power, understand as the sovereign instance
        within its society:

      </p>
      <p>
        This is the preliminary diagrammatic exposition of ‘the Cathedral’ as
        investigated in the writings of Mencius
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/">Moldbug</a>,
        where the social elite it identifies are typically described as
        ‘Brahmins’. This ruling class can be conceived, with equal plausibility,
        as an American Mandarinate. The informal ‘officials’ of this Mandarinate
        are united by the implicit and publicly-promoted belief that their only
        special interest is the truth. If in service to the truth, they find
        themselves duty-bound to tell everybody what to think, that can only be
        legitimately interpreted as a spontaneous expression of cultural
        ‘freedom’ — and not at all as the principle contemporary form of
        <em>dominion</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug calls this academic-media Mandarinate the Cathedral, in part,
        because it so evidently thinks and works as a State Church. It considers
        itself solemnly obliged to inculcate correct belief, in order that
        popular opinion makes the socio-political choices it should. With some
        modest time-lag, consumed by the workings of ‘progress’, the Cathedral
        decides what society is to agree upon. It is the pilot of American
        society, and thus — to some very considerable extent — of the world.
        When it encounters objections, it tells the world what to think about
        that, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        If sophisticated Western opinion is to make sense of the emerging soft
        power tensions in the world, it needs first to acknowledge the fact that
        the Cathedral exists, that it is a definite, specifically-motivated,
        immensely powerful entity, and that there are reasons to dislike it
        which need have nothing whatsoever to do with a fear of freedom or
        truth. An aggressively evangelizing religion, which refuses to recognize
        itself as such, is a scary thing to share a planet with. If the American
        Mandarinate cannot see that, it is likely that there are a very large
        number of other things it cannot see.

      <h4 class="post-title">Cathedral notes (#1)</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        To accompany
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/know-the-enemy-ii/">this</a> (which
        I’m treating as a very valuable work-in-progress [sic]), some initial
        straggly commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Conceptual genealogists will insist on a link to
        <a href="http://www.unterstein.net/su/docs/CathBaz.pdf">this</a>, so
        here it is. There’s a lot of discussion stimulation there. Some other
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Probably 90% of the ‘Cathedral’ discussion so far — insofar as this
        has over-spilled the NRx dikes — has consisted of “why don’t we call it
        the Synagogue?” Tedious as this may be, it’s a crucial question, because
        it effectively draws the NRx contour. If the cooptation of Judaism by
        the main cladistic trunk of dynamic modernity is not understood, nothing
        has been. ‘The Cathedral’ is a term that captures the exclusive insight
        about which NRx coalesces.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Nydrwracu’s diagram, and
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/know-the-enemy/">Radish’s</a>, are
        no doubt incomplete, but they are fully adequate to the most decisive
        point. The Cathedral is an information system — even an ‘intelligence’
        system — that is characterized, through supreme irony, by a structural
        <em>inability to learn</em>. The minimal requirement for any
        Cathedrogram is that it displays a radical deficiency of significant
        feedback links to the control core. Every apparatus of information
        <em>gathering</em> occupies a strictly subordinate position, relative to
        the sovereign Cathedral layer, which is defined exhaustively by
        <em>message promotion</em>. Core-Cathedral is a structure of read only
        memory. It is essentially <em>write-protected.</em> The whole of its
        power (and also its vulnerability) is inextricable from this feature. It
        is pure cultural genetics (and zero pragmatics).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        (4) Because the Cathedral cannot be fundamentally modified, but only
        exacerbated, or terminated, there is sadly no strategic option available
        to its enemies that is not based upon extinguishing it without residue.
        Extinctions happen. Evolution is a bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) Any argument that could imaginably pretend to perturb the Cathedral
        is going to be
        <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2014/06/11/on-hate/">hate</a>.
        The only role of rational ‘interchange’ with this entity is to expose
        its absolutely inflexible dogmatism. Reason cannot kill it, although it
        can help to demonstrate why it needs to be killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) The Cathedral is objective, supra-human
        <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2014/06/26/psychology-religion-atheists/">insanity</a>.
      </p>

        It is obviously essential to the genre that its instances are
        inter-changeable, and familiar. They do not rise to a level of
        sophistication consistent with significant differentiation, and the
        moron reservoir from whose shallows they flop out onto the bubbling
        ooze, is thrashed by a ceaseless ritual of zombie generation. This one
        is of course a classic <em>ad hominem</em> argument, the laziest way to
        bury a provocation beneath a slur, and the refuge of the half-wit
        throughout history. Michael Anissimov has already done a sound
        <a href="http://www.moreright.net/reaction-and-authoritarian-fantasies/">job</a>
        of incinerating it, noting its roots in infantile projection. Nothing
        further is really necessary (if, in fact, anything at all was).
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, there is something that can be added, and it is articulated very
        clearly by Hans Hermann Hoppe in
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUL764U5-h4">this</a> talk
        (about 29 minutes in). Aristocratic privileges are not difficult to
        acquire today, by anyone of even very modest natural capability. They
        are distributed lavishly in exchange for
        <em>services to the Cathedral</em>, even of the most nominal kind. One
        need not rise to a position of special prestige within the academy,
        media, or state bureaucracy to enjoy a complacent sense of spiritual
        superiority, it suffices merely to identify with the Elect. Linking
        <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">this</a>
        (<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-114/">again</a>) is
        irresistible. When you feel entitled — as a white person — to denounce
        white people in general
        <em>without the slightest concern that such derision might be mistaken
          for self-criticism</em>, you are not socially positioned as a revolutionary, but as a
        degenerate aristocrat. Your assumption of impregnable moral and social
        advantage is so great that it has become entirely invisible to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRx is formalist. Insofar as it obsesses on questions of aristocratic
        hierarchy — and this is far from a prevailing syndrome — it does to in
        order to draw attention to the conservation of social rank even (if not
        quite <em>especially</em>) in those social orders which most tediously
        flaunt their demotist credentials. Those reiterating moron bite #1 are
        unlikely to be the new nobles, but more probably low-grade flunkies, who
        nevertheless esteem themselves through the spiritual bond with their
        (academic and media) masters. In other words, they are scum posing as
        members of an aristocracy. Their facility at projection is remarkable.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In “The New Class Conflict,” I describe this alliance as the New
          Clerisy, which encompasses the media, the academy and the expanding
          regulatory bureaucracy. This Clerisy already dominates American
          intellectual and cultural life and increasingly has taken virtual
          control of key governmental functions, as well as the educations of
          our young people. […] Although usually somewhat progressive by
          inclination, the Clerisy actually functions much like the old First
          Estate in France – the clergy – helping determine the theology, morals
          and ideals of the broader population. […] Against such established and
          accumulated power, even a strong November showing by the GOP may have
          surprisingly little effect. Indeed, even with a Republican in the
          White House, the Clerisy’s ability to shape perceptions, educate the
          young and control key regulatory agencies will not much diminish. The
          elevation of the Clerisy to unprecedented influence may prove this
          president’s most important “gift” to posterity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kotkin throws in some misdirection, towards “Daniel Bell [who 40 years
        ago] predicted … [the rise to] ‘pre-eminence of the professional and
        technical class.'” You can judge the credibility of this intellectual
        genealogy for yourself.

        Very crudely re-stated, Moldbug’s Cathedral concept says that whatever
        is happening in the universities is an authoritative rough draft of what
        society more generally has coming to it. Politics is downstream of
        prestige culture, which the academy commands. So
        <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/">this</a>
        is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The American academy has become a self-propelling anxiety machine, in
        which steadily-consolidating totalitarianism and mental disintegration
        have been run-together into a circuit of amplification that no one knows
        how to turn off. Haidt and Lukianoff call it “vindictive protectiveness”
        driven by “emotional reasoning” which it in turn (nonlinearly) promotes.
        It corresponds to a systematic transfer of incontestable authority
        towards <em>feelings</em> of grievance. Questioning the dynamic is
        considered to be “blaming the victim” and thus a heinous crime in
        itself. Everyone gets out of the way, if they’re not indeed joining in.
        Madness intensifies. (It’s classic Left Singularity machinery.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nearly all of the campus mental-health directors surveyed in 2013 by
          the American College Counseling Association reported that the number
          of students with severe psychological problems was rising at their
          schools. The rate of emotional distress reported by students
          themselves is also high, and rising. In a 2014 survey by the American
          College Health Association, 54 percent of college students surveyed
          said that they had “felt overwhelming anxiety” in the past 12 months,
          up from 49 percent in the same survey just five years earlier.
          Students seem to be reporting more emotional crises; many seem
          fragile, and this has surely changed the way university faculty and
          administrators interact with them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The universities — being craven concentrations of cowardice, when not
        actively evil — are scared to tell their students to stop being scared.
        Radical feedback runs away unchecked. Victimological terror is
        sovereign.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what is coming down the tracks, so fast that the headlights have
        started to dazzle people. Take a look at the future. It’s screaming.

        of the Cathedral. It is downstream of the academic clerisy, who
        establish doctrine, and then perform high-level indoctrination, with
        journalism schools as a relatively subservient node on the conveyor.
        Only the <em>quantitative</em> propaganda function of the media, as the
        terminal relay to the masses, produces the impression that it
        effectively rules. Media apparatchiks have negligible intellectual
        productivity. They serve the <em>Zeitgeist</em>, by trying to remember
        what their professors taught them.

            obtained by Gawker</a>
          as part of a large Freedom of Information Act request it made back in
          2012. They show a 2009 exchange between Marc Ambinder, then-politics
          editor of The Atlantic, and Philippe Reines, a close assistant and
          adviser to Clinton during her days as Secretary of State. […] Ambinder
          asked Reines for an advance copy of a speech Clinton was scheduled to
          give at the Council on Foreign Relations. Rather than simply say yes
          or no, Reines cut a deal with Ambinder, turning over the speech
          provided Ambinder agreed to three conditions:<br />
          <strong>1) You in your own voice describe [the speech] as “muscular”<br />
            2) You note that a look at the CFR seating plan shows that all the
            envoys — from [Richard] Holbrooke to [George] Mitchell to [Dennis]
            Ross — will be arrayed in front of her, which in your own clever way
            you can say certainly not a coincidence and meant to convey
            something<br />
            3) You don’t say you were blackmailed!</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Number three is especially cynical:
        <em>Don’t, of course, admit to the truth</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ambinder does what he’s told. He doesn’t even seem to be trying to
        pretend otherwise:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>“Since I can’t remember the exact exchange I can’t really muster up a
          defense of the art, and frankly, I don’t really want to,” Ambinder
          told Gawker.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, clearly, the Cathedral concept gives these degenerate
        propaganda serfs way too much credit. They’ve got it all, and they still
        cheat.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be a mistake to head back to the drawing-board, nevertheless.
        The Cathedral isn’t dysfunctional because its corrupt, but even — and
        most dangerously — when it isn’t. Structural feedback pathology is the
        problem, with semi-criminal hackery as a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marx dismissed capitalist cheating — such as adulteration of goods — as
        an ultimate irrelevance, that only confused the principal line of his
        critique. NRx should hold to the same approach in its critique of the
        Cathedral, insofar as it aims for theoretical resilience (rather than
        anecdotal sniping). It has still to be admitted that the Ambinder-types
        don’t help.

    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Imagine, hypothetically, that you wanted the regime to succeed. Would
        you recommend Cathedralization? Cynically considered, the track record
        is, at least, not bad. Planetary dominion is not to be sniffed at.
        (Suggestions in this direction are not unknown, even in XS comment
        threads.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cathedral, defined with this question in mind, is the subsumption of
        politics into propaganda. It tends — as it develops — to convert all
        administrative problems into public relations challenges. A solution —
        actual or prospective — is a successful
        <em>management of perceptions</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the mature Cathedral, a crisis takes the consistent form:
        <em><a
            href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12130843/EU-leaders-No-link-between-Cologne-sex-attacks-and-migrant-crisis.html">This</a>
          looks bad</em>. It is not merely stupid. As Spandrell recently observes, in comments
        on
        <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/power/">power</a>, “… power isn’t born out of the
        barrel
        of
        a gun. Power is born out of
        the ability to have people with guns do what you tell them.” (XS
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/on-power/">note</a>.) The question
        of legitimacy is, in a real sense, fundamental, when politics sets the
        boundaries of the cosmos under consideration. (So Cathedralism is also
        the hypertrophy of politics, to the point where a reality outside it
        loses all credibility.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Is your civilization decaying? Then you
        <em>need to persuade people that it is not</em>. If there still seems to
        be a mismatch between problem and solution here, Cathedralism has not
        entirely consumed your brain. To speculate (confidently) further —
        you’re not a senior power-broker in a modern Western state. You’re even,
        from a certain perspective, a fossil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cathedralism works, in its own terms, as long as there are no definite
        limits to the efficacy of propaganda. To pose the issue at a
        comparatively shallow level, if the political response to a crisis
        simply <em>is</em> the crisis, and that response can be effectively
        controlled (through propaganda, broadly conceived), then the Cathedral
        commands an indisputable practical wisdom. It would be sensible to go
        long on the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If however (imagine this, if you still can) manipulation of
        <em>the response to crisis</em> is actually a suppression of the
        feedback <em>required to really tackle the crisis</em>, then an
        altogether different story is unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is reality subordinated to the Cathedral because — and exactly so far as
        — ‘the people’ are? That is the question.

      <p>
        <em>On moral grounds I sympathize with the African-American view, but
          there is an even more urgent reason to rip down the Confederate flag.
          Our refusal to look squarely at the evil character of the American
          Confederacy turned us into idiots. It may be a bit late to remedy this
          national lapse in mental capacity, but one has to start somewhere. …
          That is American exceptionalism: the belief that America can be a
          better kind of nation than the ethnocentric nations of Europe, in
          emulat[i]on of the biblical Israel. That was the impulse of the
          Founders, born, as Harvard’s Eric Nelson explains in
          <strong>The Hebrew Republic</strong>, of the English Revolution’s
          attempt to design a polity on biblical principles. The Civil War
          destroyed this impulse, because it killed too many of the New
          Englanders who believed, as Lincoln put it, that America was “an
          almost chosen nation.” … Protestantism in America shifted from saving
          souls to social engineering. The sin of the South was too great to
          acknowledge; after the sacrifice of nearly 30% of its military-age man
          and the reduction of its standard of living by half, the defeated
          white South could not admit to itself that it had gotten precisely
          what was coming to it for wickedness of slavery. … the Confederates
          fought with desperate courage, but for rapine rather than right.
          Crushing them was the noblest thing the United States ever did. … The
          South could not live in the knowledge that its heroic sacrifices were
          offered in a wicked cause, and its response was to excise from
          religion the notion of sin and virtue, and replace it with social
          engineering. … The Civil War made us stupid. It persuaded us that we
          were better off playing God than leaving the outcome to a God who
          might demand such terrible sacrifices of us once again. … The trauma
          of the Civil War drove us towards Wilsonian Universalism, which lives
          on in the form of George W. Bush’s “world democratic revolution.”
          America confronts a number of cultures that are bent on genosuicide.
          We fail to recognize the symptoms, because we shut our eyes to one of
          modern history’s most striking examples of civilizational
          self-destruction, namely the American South. America can’t hope to
          make sense of the world if it refuses to think about its own
          history.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Spengler appends some crucial explanatory remarks:</p>
      <p>
        <em>As many people have pointed out (Michael Novak, Meir Soloveichik),
          there is a biblical (covenantal) as well as a natural law
          (contractual) component to the Founding; in my view the covenantal
          component is primary and in need trumps the natural-law component. …
          The Constitutional mechanism broke down (in fact, the slave party
          controlled the government for almost all of the period 1800-1860, and
          an eruption of apocalyptic spirit was required to correct it —
          bringing to the fore America’s Hebraic-Protestant mission. Of course
          Lincoln ran roughshod over elements of the Constitution but this, in
          my view, was what the Talmud calls “sin for the sake of heaven.” The
          natural-law apparatus (checks and balances, separation of powers,
          states’ rights, etc.) is the plumbing of government, and it is
          certainly necessary, but it is contingent on the higher, covenantal
          imperative.</em>

        the Left to get (still more) religion:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Evangelical groups unite around a set of core convictions, overt,
          codified and non-negotiable. It would surely not be difficult to
          create a similar set, common to all progressive movements, built
          around empathy, kindness, forgiveness and self-worth</em>
        [you know, <strong>redemption</strong>].
        <em>A set of immutable convictions might make our movements less
          capricious while reinforcing the commonality between the left’s many
          causes. […] Evangelism is positive and propositional (to evangelise is
          to bring good news). You cannot achieve lasting change unless you set
          the agenda, rather than responding to that of your opponents. […] They
          welcome everyone – but in particular the unconverted. Instead of
          anathematising difference, doubt and hesitation, they explain and
          normalise these responses as steps within a journey to belief.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only reason this isn’t pure Left-Moldbuggianism is that it still
        seems to think it’s doing something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>The Guardian</em> actually used that picture to illustrate the

        argument seems strangely familiar. Still, if the central thesis of

        <em>The desire to be redeemed from sin (redefined as a social fact)
          identifies the post-Protestants as children of the Puritans. That
          insight is what makes his new book a new and invaluable contribution
          to our understanding of America’s frame of mind. Just what is a
          secular religion, and how does it shape the spiritual lives of its
          adherents? Bottum deftly peels the layers off the onion of liberal
          thinking to reveal its Protestant provenance and inherited religious
          sensibility. The Mainline Protestantism that once bestrode American
          public life never died, but metamorphosed into a secular doctrine of
          redemption. And that was made possible by the conversion of sin from a
          personal to a social fact in Walter Rauschenberg’s version of the
          social gospel. Bottum writes, “The new elite class of America is the
          old one: America’s Mainline Protestant Christians, in both the glory
          and the annoyingness of their moral confidence and spiritual
          certainty. They just stripped out the Christianity along the way.” By
          redefining sin as social sin, Rauschenberg raised up a new Satan and a
          new vocabulary of redemption from his snares. According to Bottum, his
          “central demand is to see social evil as really existing evil — a
          supernatural force of dark magic.”</em>

      <p>
        Is this a socially intolerable revelation,
        in the sense that its acceptance would make the existing order of the
        world impossible? In other words, can the Cathedral overtly embrace its
        own Neo-Puritanism, without terminal disturbance? This is a question
        that might rapidly become inescapable.

          division and of the attribution of value. The article provides an

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whether you choose to think about it or not, I have a very simple
          explanation of Anglo-American success as it relates to democracy. […]
          If you see democracy as a pest, like Dutch elm disease, it makes
          perfect sense. Dutch elm disease originates in China. Therefore,
          Chinese elms are resistant to Dutch elm disease. But not immune! It’s
          still a crippling disease in China. But the trees live. […] The result
          of globalization: Chinese elms dominate the world. And hybrids. An elm
          does not live, anywhere in the world, unless its DNA is mostly
          Chinese. It would be a mistake to conclude from this that Dutch elm
          disease is good for elm trees, and the Chinese should export it to
          everyone. Unless they’re just plain evil. […] All we have to observe,
          to show that this is the case, is to show that politics in the
          Anglo-American tradition (don’t forget, Marx wrote in the British
          Library, and his column appeared in the New York Tribune), (a)
          frequently causes serious damage to Anglo-American countries, and (b)
          always or almost always has two results in other countries: it either
          causes massive, traumatic disasters, or brings the country under
          effective Anglo-American supervision, and/or both.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Various kinds of elective monarchies have been tried, and worked
          reasonably well (as does hereditary monarchy). But there is a real
          qualitative difference between joint-stock governance and anything
          else. Which is why joint-stock companies kill all competitors which
          experiment with different operating systems.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The “monarchy” language is incredibly unhelpful to the communication of
        the central point being made here. How many times is it possible to say
        “the Neocameral CEO is nothing like a monarch as you understand the
        term” without utter exasperation? ‘Boldmug’ clearly has more patience on
        this front that I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: From another commentator, responding to the moron bite
        “[‘Boldmug’] is defending returning to some sort of racially-segregated
        nationalistic authoritarian regime.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No. Mencius Moldburg advocates for neocameralism. Interestingly
          enough it is the same as Scott Alexander’s Archipelago. The difference
          is Moldburg has a mechanism to enforce things and Alexander never got
          around to elaborating one. […] In case you don’t want to bother
          looking it up, it basically means having a bunch of Singapore like
          city states with free movement and explicitly based political power.
          It is the exact opposite of ethno-nationalism.</em>

        While everybody is compelled to economize in this way to some extent,

        tribal

        foundational principle of realistic socio-political analysis, or
        informally manifested in a spreading and deepening cynicism. What little

        deference to the enemy’s enemy. No

        meaning, up to this point, is that
        <em>we don’t any longer believe what we’ve been told</em>.
      </p>

        We remember enough about what Science once was, or what market-honed
        economic signals were, to know that tribal epistemology is cognitive
        garbage. As we slide down the slope, increasingly, it’s the garbage heap
        in which we all live.

        <em>Or at least there is zero evidence that it did. These are smart,
          rational people falling for a scam. Why? It’s in part because Twitter
          fosters this group-think and lack of critical thought — you just click
          a button and, with little effort, you’ve spread whatever you want
          people to believe — but it’s also because they’re so convinced of the
          righteousness of their cause (electing Clinton/defeating Trump) that
          they have cast all limits and constraints to the side, believing that
          any narrative or accusation or smear, no matter how false or

        The day before the election, <em>Der Spiegel</em>
        <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/divided-states-of-america-notes-on-the-decline-of-a-great-nation-a-865295.html"
          target="_blank">described</a>
        “the United States as a country that doesn’t understand the signs of the
        times and has almost willfully — flying in the face of all scientific
        knowledge — chosen to be backward.” For the magazine’s staff writers,
        the problem was utterly straightforward. “The hatred of big government
        has reached a level in the United States that threatens the country’s
        very existence.” Retrogressive forces were impeding the country’s
        progress by refusing to grasp the obvious identity of Leviathan and
        social advancement. It should now be obvious to everyone – even charred
        tea partiers gibbering shell-shocked in the ruins — that contemporary
        American democracy provides all the impetus necessary to bulldoze such
        obstructionism aside. The State is God, and all shall bend to its will.
        Forward!
      </p>
      <p>
        With the ascension of USG to godhood, a new purity is attained, and a
        fantastic (and
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-11-06/it-doesnt-matter" target="_blank">Titanic</a>) experiment
        progresses to a new stage. It is no longer necessary to
        enter into controversy with the shattered detritus of the right,
        henceforth all that matters is the test of strength between concentrated
        political motivation and the obduracy of reality itself. Which is to
        say: the final resistance to be overcome is the insolent idea of a
        reality principle, or outside. Once there is no longer any
        <em>way of things</em> that exists independently of the State’s
        sovereign desire, Left Singularity is attained. This is the
        eschatological promise that sings its hallelujahs in every progressive
        breast. It translates perfectly into the colloquial chant:
        <em>yes we can!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it needs to be clearly understood that ‘we’ – now and going
        forward – means the State. Through the State we do anything and
        everything, which we can, if not really, then at least truly, as
        promised. The State is ‘us’ as God. Hegel already saw all this, but it
        took progressive educational systems to generalize the insight. Now our
        time has come, or is coming. All together now: yes we can! Nothing but a
        brittle reactionary <em>realism</em> stands in our way, and that is
        something we can be educated out of (yes we can). We have! See our
        blasted enemies strewn in utter devastation before us.
      </p>
      <p>The world is to be as we will it to be. Surely.</p>

        <em>Hang on, you can stop composing that all-caps comment – I don’t

        ‘To Beat ISIS, the Arab World Must Promote Political and Religious
        Reforms’, Rule Jebreal

        us. Picking on a writer for a headline is a mistake — who knows where it
        came from in the editorial process? — and, besides, this one employs
        (the exhortative) ‘must’ in its sole appropriate usage — as the
        completion of a hypothetical imperative. “If you want X, you must do Y”
        — that’s OK. (Y is a necessary condition for the accomplishment of X.)
        ‘Must’ is tolerable if it’s kept on a leash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once it slips the collar, ‘must’ reverts to its status as the most
        preposterous word in the English language, an instrument of sheer
        obfuscation. Watch it go:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The United States <strong>must</strong> review its policies across
          the Middle East. … It <strong>must</strong> take a stand against
          Riyadh’s promotion of exclusionary Wahhabism. […] … Likewise, pressure
          <strong>must</strong> be placed on Egypt to abandon its witch hunt of
          the Muslim Brotherhood. In undertaking an effective counter terrorism
          strategy, the United States <strong>must</strong> partner with the
          Arab states to undertake political reforms that ultimately lead to
          underwriting a social contract in which every group of the population
          are represented and protected. […] … If the United States and Iraqi
          government want to defeat ISIS, they <strong>must</strong> now ensure
          the inclusion and protection of Iraqi Sunnis, Kurds and Yazidis, along
          with the majority Shi’ites [this one is minimally OK]. […] …
          Eventually, a process of reconciliation <strong>must</strong> be
          initiated between Shi’ites and Sunnis. This centuries-old dispute is
          played out today in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which
          has produced a monster that threatens the national security of not
          only Middle Eastern nations, but also the United States. It
          <strong>must</strong> come to an end. […] … The Obama Administration
          <strong>must</strong> pursue a policy of severe sanctions against any
          and all countries that finance jihadist — even if they are our own
          allies. … What will ultimately turn the tide in the Middle East are
          groups that actively advocate for a democratic culture and its values
          around the Arab world. A campaign to promote these ideas on every
          level <strong>must</strong> begin, as part of the counterterrorism
          initiative launched by Kerry.</em>
        [Emphases added.]
      </p>
      <p><em>Must</em> they, really? Will they? Can they?</p>
      <p>
        It’s irritating to see moral fanaticism — betrayed by its distinctive
        combination of groundless certainty and communicative fervor —
        masquerading as realistic analysis. The disguise is only necessary
        because the prescription so exorbitantly exceeds the diagnosis, tripping
        eagerly into glassy-eyed deontological intellectual abandonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Middle East <em>must</em> stop being the Middle East, and America
        <em>must</em> help to make this happen.” It can’t, and it won’t, on both
        counts. The musty smell is simply annoying.

          Put another way, I am hostile to this kind of thing not because I
          believe it’s probably false, but because I believe a lot of it is
          probably true — and we have shown that we, by our natures, can’t
          handle this kind of truth. […] My point is simply that all of us
          believe that some facts are too dangerous to be known; they are like
          the Ring Of Power, in that the temptation to abuse them is too great
          for our natures to bear. […] Admittedly, this puts me in a tight spot.
          Am I saying that we should ignore reality? I suppose I am.</em>

        just the greatest thing ever, or what?

      <p>
        <em>Both [Laurie] Penny and [Richard] Seymour have made a point of
          arguing, moreover, for the latest fad in leftist thinking:
          <strong>intersectionality</strong>. “Intersectionality” supposedly
          means taking seriously the many different oppressions, and how they
          intersect. “My socialism will be intersectional or it will be
          bullshit,” Seymour has made a point of saying. Given that they are so
          keen to speak out against oppression in all its multi-layered forms,
          it seems really bad luck that they should be accused of being “racist
          crackers” and “white settlers.”</em>

        One thing to emphasize — ‘science’ is the data, as well as the error.
        This is not a picture of black hole, uncorrectable reality denial, of
        the kind familiar from political economy. That said, the speculative
        hypothesis was turned into a story for public promotion, and then into
        something very close to an official dogma. Now that it isn’t holding
        together,
        <a

        type of thing starts happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has the scientific establishment ever been so off-beam, in the entire
        history of the West? Not only wrong, but aggressively doctrinaire, and
        politically assertive in the direction of error? For anybody who esteems
        the development of natural science as the single greatest historical
        achievement of the Occidental world, the AGW saga has been a hideous
        embarrassment. Our institutions are broken.

        the new social hierarchy:
      </p>
      <p>
        [First, the background:]
        <em>Faith McGregor is the lesbian who doesn’t like the girly cuts that
          they do at a salon. She wants the boy’s hairdo. … Omar Mahrouk is the
          owner of the Terminal Barber Shop in Toronto. He follows Shariah law,
          so he thinks women have cooties. As Mahrouk and the other barbers
          there say, they don’t believe in touching women other than their own
          wives. … Mahrouk’s view is illiberal. But in Canada we believe in
          property rights and freedom of association — and in this case, freedom
          of religion, too. … McGregor ran to the Human Rights Tribunal and
          demanded that Mahrouk give her a haircut.</em>
      </p>
      <p>[…]</p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh, McGregor is politically correct. But just not politically correct
          enough. It’s like poker.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A white, Christian male has the lowest hand — it’s like he’s got just
          one high card, maybe an ace. So almost everyone trumps him.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A white woman is just a bit higher — like a pair of twos. Enough to
          beat a white man, but not much more.</em>
      </p>
      <p><em>A gay man is like having two pairs in poker.</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>A gay woman — a lesbian like McGregor — is like having three of a
          kind.</em>
      </p>
      <p><em>A black lesbian is a full house — pretty tough to beat.</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless she’s also in a wheelchair, which means she’s pretty much a
          straight flush.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The only person who could trump that would be a royal flush. If the
          late Sammy Davis Jr. — who was black, Jewish and half-blind — were to
          convert to Islam and discover he was 1/64th Aboriginal.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So which is a better hand: A lesbian who wants a haircut or a Muslim
          who doesn’t want to give it to her?</em>

          argument” in conventional terms should win. Many, if not most, see
          debate as a means for advancing social justice and dismantling
          oppressive hierarchies of whiteness and patriarchy. Inasmuch as
          “logic” upholds these hierarchies and personal experiences from POC

        <em>Speaking in 2011 after the jailing of two of the men, former Home

        round-up of orchestrated obliviousness.

        Does the progressive media really think it can de-realize this festival
        of cultural ruin with a standard inattention protocol? If so, it has to
        count as an extraordinary peak <em>hubris</em> moment. Perhaps the left
        is structurally incapable of preventing itself from pushing things over
        the brink of catastrophe. It always has to take that one additional
        step, and it has no sense at all of how to back down.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have to be a lot of people in the UK right now who would be
        delighted to see the media establishment strung up from lamp-posts, with
        panic and defection rife in journalistic ranks. It’s surely not
        impossible that the pattern now jutting into hideous visibility in
        Britain will evoke a disturbing sense of recognition elsewhere, possibly
        throughout the Anglosphere. As far as core Cathedral operating
        procedures are concerned, this has to be a period of (possibly
        unprecedented) vulnerability. As a source of regime threatening
        irritability, the Rotherham syndrome is the
        <em>droit du seigneur</em> of the new nobility — even among a pitifully
        broken people, it pushes some deeply atavistic buttons. Lies, sexual
        exploitation, and foreign invasion — who’d want to be PR manager for
        this cocktail of native degradation?

        Politically incorrect research, however solidly established, is
        especially singled out for this treatment. Some approved (i.e. Leftist)
        authority somewhere has provided the excuse to dismiss awkward findings,
        so that the painful stimulus can be suppressed, and — just to be safe —
        even the pretext for suppressing it is best forgotten, leaving only the
        permission to be undisturbed in public circulation. All crime-think has
        been ‘well refuted’ (sociologically <em>a priori</em>) as far as these
        people are concerned. “It’s been well refuted” means
        <em>exactly</em> “wouldn’t it be nice if this didn’t exist?” (or “nice
        people have told us we don’t need to worry about that”).

        It’s a simplification to conceive the Cathedral as a media apparatus. As
        simplifications go, however, one could do far worse. Media are essential
        to the Cathedral, even if by no means casually synonymous with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is surely noteworthy that ‘the media’ have become singular, in much
        the same way as ‘the United States’ have done. ‘They’ have turned into a
        thing, and one that is still far from being confidently understood. Even
        when subjectively identifying with a residual plurality, they cannot but
        identify themselves with a unitary effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it would be asking far too much to expect the Cathedral to
        identify itself as a central causal factor in a world going insane, it
        gets close. <em>NYmag</em>
        <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/08/what-all-this-bad-news-is-doing-to-us.html">expresses</a>
        deep concern about the consequences of the news machine:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A terrifying jihadist group is conquering and butchering its way
          across big swaths of Iraq and Syria. Planes are falling out of the sky
          on what seems like a weekly basis. Civilians are being killed in
          massive numbers in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Others are falling prey
          to Ebola in West Africa. The world, in short, is falling apart.</em>
        […]
        <em>That’s how it feels, at least, to those of us who sit at a blessed
          remove from the death and destruction, but who are watching every
          bloody moment of it via cable news and social media. It raises an
          important question: In an age when we can mainline bad news 24/7 if we
          so choose, what’s the psychological impact of all this exposure to
          tragedy at a distance?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing upon the work of Mary McNaughton-Cassill (a University of
        Texas–San Antonio professor at the “leading researcher on the connection
        between media consumption and stress”), it describes a process of
        “negative-information overload” driven by market-incentivized
        sensationalism, compounded by social media revolution, and prone to
        poorly-understood tangles of psycho-media feedback. Since a story of
        this kind consists primarily of the Cathedral talking to itself, with
        everyone else listening in, we quickly learn that the ‘problem’ cashes
        out into pessimistic disengagement from electoral politics and
        progressive voluntarism. According to McNaughton-Cassill, negative news
        bombardment produces “this malaise: ‘Everything’s kinda bad’ and ‘Why
        should I vote? It’s not gonna help’ and ‘I could donate money, but
        there’s just gonna be another kid who’s starving next week.’”
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <em>In addition to a burgeoning sense of helplessness, she said,
          cognitive shortcuts triggered by the news can also lead us to
          gradually see the world as a darker and darker place, chipping away at
          certain optimistic tendencies. McNaughton-Cassill’s research suggests
          that that all things being equal, if you ask people, regardless of
          their circumstances, to evaluate what’s going around them — Do they
          think their neighbors are good people? Do they think the local schools
          are solid? — “People always say yes in their immediate setting.”</em>
        […]
        <em>Zoom out a little, though, and people have less to go on. … “As soon
          as you get out of your zone, most of your information’s from the news
          … and the news by definition covers the extreme things.”</em>
        […]
        <em>People could be forgiven for adopting a hell-in-a-handbasket stance
          toward the rest of the world.</em>
        […]
        <em>That’s a problem, because when people are led to believe things are
          falling apart, it affects their decision-making and their politics —
          whether or not their pessimism is warranted. We already know from
          political-psychological research that
          <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/calling-truce-political-wars/">the more threatened people
            feel, the more likely they will be to
            support right-wing policies</a>. And people who believe in the concept of unmitigated evil
          <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/40/1/16.short">appear more likely</a>
          to support torture and other violent policies.</em>

        <em>It’s hard to fully sketch out these mechanisms, of course. Could
          years and years of exposure to negative news heighten your belief in a

      </p>
      <p>
        As noted, there are some critical feedback circuits excluded (in
        principal) from this analysis, in part to preserve the fundamental
        architecture of the progressive historical narrative (“… on a broader

        …”). Media malfunction as core meltdown of Western Civilization, sucking
        the world into hell, wouldn’t fit this story at all. Nevertheless, it’s
        clearly creeping in around the edges, and something considerably more
        drastic than standard information manipulation procedures seem to be
        called for.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How can we fight back against the unnecessary coarsening of our
          outlook that may be occurring every time we glance at one of our
          gadgets? The simplest technique is … to “Just turn it off.” That is,
          take a break from the news.</em>
        […]
        <em>“You can’t change the externals,” she said. “You have to get some
          control mentally.” What’s most important is “getting a handle on why
          you get anxious and worried about things that probably aren’t going to
          happen, or knowing what your triggers are.” The more you understand
          your own reaction to the news, the easier it will be to shape your
          news-consumption habits in an adaptive way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If this sounds like subtle begging, it really kind of is. Afflicted by
        incomprehensible cybernetic pathologies, the media system is failing in
        its responsibility to screen you from reality, and now — quite
        desperately — needs your help. You can’t any longer rely on propaganda
        to save you. In fact, you have to assume that there’s a really good
        story out there that the media is keeping from you. You have to
        “understand that you’re seeing a lot of bad news not because the world
        is an inherently evil place, but because news outlets — not to mention
        individual Twitter and Facebook users — have lots of incentives to
        broadcast explosively negative news stories.”
        <em>We interrupt this world historical nightmare to deliver an important
          news flash — the media has gone insane</em>. You have to protect yourself, or it will seem as if the whole
        global
        order is falling apart into bloody chaos around your ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Overall, of course, it’s both unrealistic and undesirable to
          construct bubbles that keep out the world’s bad news. But there’s a
          difference between being informed and being obsessive, and it’s a line
          that’s very easy to accidentally slide across in an age when there’s
          so much scary information zipping around.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Scariest of all is the system of information itself, but it can’t quite
        get that part of the story into coherent shape. By the time it does, the
        world will have descended by another gyre. Experts now confirm that
        throwing your TV set out of the window will help …

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a> is our

        currently pursued.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously most comic, tragic, and prominent is the reflexive
        perception that contemporary hegemonic power is being devoured by the

          crises across the world are not comparable to the challenges the U.S.
          faced during the Cold War. […] Acknowledging “the barbarity” of
          Islamist militants and Russia “reasserting the notion that might means
          right,” Obama, though, dismissed the notion that he was facing
          unprecedented challenges. […] “The world’s always been messy … we’re
          just noticing now in part because of social media,” he said, according

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The death toll from the worst Ebola outbreak on record has reached
          nearly 7,000 in West Africa, according to the World Health
          Organisation. […] The toll of 6,928 dead showed a leap of just over

        Is it because the epidemic has remained geographically concentrated,

        with the “country … reporting around 400 to 500 new cases each week for

        Don’t be distracted if (like me) you find the PUA antics ridiculous.
        Clarey’s argument
        <a href="http://www.therebel.media/roosh_the_man_the_social_justice_warriors_can_t_beat">here</a>
        is important — and even an essential jigsaw-puzzle piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maximally compressed: Left Mind-Control strategies depend upon the
        persistence of certain socio-economic realities that they are themselves
        profoundly subverting. It’s impossible, at one and the same time, to
        threaten people with expulsion from the mainstream economy and also
        destroy this same economy. Yet that paradox is where the SJW army makes
        its home. The consequence: the perverse production of a type of “man who
        has nothing to lose, and therefore nothing the SJW’s can threaten.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The SJWs aren’t doing this on their own. A range of technological and
        economic developments are converging on the creation of a new,
        collapse-phase rugged individualism. The Left call it the ‘<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precariat">precariat</a>‘ and insist that ‘neoliberalism’ is to blame.
        It
        doesn’t really
        matter, as far as Clarey’s point is concerned. The essential thing is
        the the hostage-holding presumption of SJW activism is not a reliable
        social fixture, and their own activities are hastening its
        disappearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final irony Clarey points to, is the creation of a new
        entrepreneurial sector that lives, precisely, from the depredations of
        the SJWs. Their attacks constitute the basic pipeline of cultural
        raw-materials off which this little group survives — at once a source of
        content and a publicity machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        While those on the dissident right discuss the Exit question, SJWs are
        busy pushing us off the gangplank. There’s only one attitude that makes
        any sense to those already bobbing among the waves: “Come on in, the
        water’s fine.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: ‘SJW’ is not being used here as a slur, but only in its technical
        sense. It means something like ‘a Red Guard of the Cathedral’.

      <p>
        <em>Coincidentally, the same years which have witnessed the emergency of
          speech codes on many campuses have also witnessed an accelerated
          symbiosis between the pro SF community and academia (in that greater
          numbers of SF/fantasy writers have as day jobs teaching at the
          post-high school level, and SF literature and film has become an
          increasingly respectable and popular subject of university courses). …
          For many individuals under the age of forty who have been through the
          university system, mau-mauing may seem normative, or at least
          unremarkable. They have seen it at work through divestment campaigns
          of various kinds (divestment from Israeli companies or U.S. companies
          which provide goods to Israel which might be used in security
          operations against Palestinians, or from companies involved in fossil
          fuel production, or from companies connected to certain figures active
          on the Right, such as the Koch brothers) and through shout-downs and
          other disruptions of speakers invited to campus whose backgrounds or
          viewpoints are contrary to those favored by student activists.</em>

        It’s deeply disturbing, as pretty much everything is these days. (Those

        ‘voice’ and ‘freedom of speech’, far from being near synonyms, are
        closer to antonyms.

          allocated by global demographics, with the requisite number of
          Aboriginals and so forth. South Africa, with BEE, is rapidly
          approaching this point. If you want to make all the present
          programmers at Facebook racists, it’s an excellent way to proceed, but
          I really don’t think it will lead to your uniform, perfect and beige

        The idea that the progressive race religion is something that can be
        productively reasoned about ended for many of us at
        <em>precisely</em> the moment NRx began. Still, trying — or pretending
        to try — to argue optimistically about it could (perhaps) remain
        worthwhile as an experiment, even without the slightest realistic chance
        that it could work.

        An utterly compelling tangle of arguments
        <a href="http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html">at</a> The Center for
        Evolutionary Psychology, where the intersection of science and society
        is ripped open by controversy over Kevin MacDonald and his relation to
        Darwinian biorealism. Evo Psych star John Tooby makes some important
        points about the politics of denunciation, bringing the distinct spectra
        of political allegiance and sociological genetics into complex
        collision. Where do the implications of Hamiltonian inclusive fitness
        lead? (HBD doesn’t quite come into focus, but it haunts the discussion
        from the edges.)
      </p>
      <p>For a sense of how murky this gets:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <em>For those who are interested in carefully tracing out the dauntingly
          complex relationships between biology, brain, mind, and culture, this
          is all very familiar terrain. In the mid-1970’s, for example, Gould,
          Lewontin, and a few others injected heavy-handed moralizing, easy
          denunciation, the attribution of dubious intellectual genealogies, and
          an <strong>ad hominem</strong> attack-style into scientific debate in
          an effort to settle intellectual disputes by other means. One belief
          they cultivated assiduously was the myth that leading evolutionary
          scholars were ideologically motivated right-wingers. Due to my
          empiricist inclinations, I was the only person I knew who actually
          gathered data on this widely credited claim. The results were what
          common sense would lead you to expect: Evolutionists included
          communists, ex-communists, a wide array of non-doctrinaire Marxists,
          democratic socialists, anarchists, feminists, a Black Panther Party
          member (recently joined by a second), antiwar activists, many
          <strong>New Republic</strong> liberals, some apoliticals, and a neocon
          – a distribution (for better or worse) indistinguishable from any
          randomly sampled selection of faculty at leading research universities
          at the time. […] The most notorious tactic of Gould, Lewontin, and
          their allies during the early years was their attempt to drag the
          ideas they opposed under by manufacturing links to various repugnant
          doctrines. One moral problem with ignoring truth-value in employing
          such tactics is that these socially constructed links pull in both
          directions. The key theoretical breakthroughs central to sociobiology
          (inclusive fitness theory, parental investment theory, and so on)
          turned out to elegantly explain large sets of observations, and so
          went on to win the debates within the technical journals in
          evolutionary biology. Although Lewontin’s and Gould’s opposition to
          the most significant innovations in evolutionary biology over the last
          30 years is nothing more than a quaint intellectual footnote within
          evolutionary biology, the fruits of their mythologizing live on
          outside of it. They live on in the spurious legitimacy that they gave
          to the netherworld of marginal scholarship (of which MacDonald is a
          typical example) that embraces the doctrines that the “moralists” were
          putatively fighting. More significantly, they did succeed in tarring
          the revolution in evolutionary biology in the eyes of nonbiologists,
          together with any serious attempt to think through the relationship
          between culture, human nature, and human evolution. This has
          perpetuated the antiquated status quo, during which social scientists
          have remained wary of the possibility of scientifically mapping human
          nature, and have remained almost totally ignorant of modern
          evolutionary biology.</em>

        (without giving any indication of recognizing it). If this book and

          notoriety attracted new talent. In short, the field became weak and
          poorly integrated, with low status, limited funding, and publicity the
          main currency of academic reward. This, according to Panofsky, is why
          it is afflicted with “persistent, ungovernable controversy” …</em>

          with such people, right? Perhaps their reasoning capacities are
          hampered in some way. Indeed, one begins to wonder, could it perhaps
          be something … inborn? […] Basically, declaring oneself to be on the
          avant-garde of “reason” is always going to lead to racism if you take
          it to its logical conclusion. Thankfully for the mental health of the
          “party of reason,” however, their self-regard and in-group loyalty
          keep them from following the dictates of reason on this matter,
          because it would make it seem like maybe their empty gesture at a
          contentless “reason” had accidentally made them into bad people.</em>

        at Scott Alexander’s place:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think the actual argument against IQ is this:<br />
          1. Intelligence is a measure of your value as a person in a wide range
          of situations.<br />
          2. IQ supposedly measures intelligence.<br />
          3. IQ may not be significantly changeable.<br />
          4. Therefore, this test lets you measure the innate aptitude and this
          value of a person.<br />
          5. Therefore, this could be used to prove I am inherently less
          valuable than other people.<br />
          6. This makes me REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.<br />
          7. Therefore, IQ is wrong.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>I’m pretty sure this is the real argument against IQ, and most
          arguments against it are simply attempts to find arguments that fit
          this conclusion.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My only significant quibble with this construction concerns point #5,
        which massively underestimates the predominance of pathological altruism
        / social terror in the IQ ‘debate’. The possibility that IQ measurements
        could make <em>other people</em> seem in some awkward way inferior is a
        far more powerful deterrent than anything it could say about oneself.
        (The probability that someone is going to say something stupid about IQ
        has a striking positive correlation with IQ.)

        <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/11/does-the-glasgow-coma-scale-exist-do-comas/">post</a>
        itself makes a (wholly superfluous) strong argument for the robust
        realism of the <em>g</em> concept. If you’re the kind of crime-stopped
        idiot who needs persuading about it, you’re almost certainly beyond
        persuasion. The relevant fork in the road has already been passed.
        Rationalists find it strangely hard to grasp that simple fact. They’re
        nice that way.

          percent of its winners since the late 1980s, when East African
          nutrition and technology started catching up with the West, have been
          from Kenya. Since 1988, for example, 20 of the 25 first-place men in
          the Boston Marathon have been Kenyan. … Of the

          London marathons were won by Kenyans, and the sole outlier was from
          neighboring Ethiopia. Their record in the Olympic men’s marathon is
          more uneven, having placed in the top three in only four of the last
          six races. Still, not bad for one country. And even more amazing is
          that three-fourths of the Kenyan champions come from an ethnic

          differences lead particular racial groups to succeed more often at
          sports, and focuses on how that belief shows up within journalism.
          Collaborating with University of Connecticut doctoral student Devon

          newspaper articles across the globe from 2003-2014. Among the articles

          that nearly 55 percent of these media narratives uncritically parroted
          and perpetuated the belief that African-descended groups excel in

        If, like this blog, you have been benighted enough to understand

        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pet-trolls-1/">pets</a>, you
        apparently need a good talking to. Farhad Manjoo writing in (surprise!)
        <em>The New York Times</em> has a lesson you need to hear. Trolling, it
        turns out, has a very simple explanation — it is exactly identical to a
        Political Incorrectness. To be a troll is in fact simply not being a
        progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citing Doctor Whitney Phillips, of Humboldt State University, and a
        troll expert (who has written a
        <a href="http://billions-and-billions.com/2014/02/13/my-book-officially-forthcoming-with-mit-press/">book</a>
        on the subject), Manjoo illuminates the phenomenon unambiguously:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If there’s one thing the history of the Internet has taught us, it’s
          that trolls will be difficult to contain because they really reflect
          base human society in all its ugliness.

      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>“It’s not a question of whether or not we’re winning the war on
          trolling, but whether we’re winning the war on misogyny, or racism,
          and ableism and all this other stuff,” Dr. Phillips said. “Trolling is
          just a symptom of those bigger problems.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As with so very many other things, there’s no solution to trolling short
        of the absolute triumph of progressive across the whole of the earth.
        This is an argument crying out for an

        with reality. As they cephalize, and socialize, stories substitute for
        reflexes, and the survival value of a story owes almost nothing to its
        factuality. Believing what everyone else does, or what makes you feel
        good, counts for vastly more. Wherever it is that discussion leads, it
        is only very rarely, and accidentally, in the direction of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Science begins with the realization that stories aren’t to be trusted,
        even – or especially – if they sound credible, conform to prior
        intuitions, and readily attain social approval. Since narrative
        satisfaction is the great deceiver, science reaches beyond language into
        the vast frigid tracts of mathematical signs, stripped clean of all
        moral and emotional significance. Hardening itself against the
        temptation to see faces in the clouds, or hear voices from the heavens,
        it digs determinedly into the test-bed of numbers and quantitative
        signals, where seductive words are led to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Economics has never been a science, but economic behavior, and even
        theory, has been able to avail itself of a measure of leverage against
        story-telling. Its great resource in this regard has been the price
        system, expressed in ‘meaningless’ quantities (without immediate
        narrative significance) which enable economic calculation to sustain a
        posture of ideological indifference. An accountant who tells a story is
        a bad accountant, and most probably a criminal, whilst an entrepreneur
        fixated upon a story of how things ‘must be’ is subject to
        market-Darwinian nemesis. That, at least, is how
        <em>laissez-faire</em> hard money capitalism once roughly worked, as
        attested for instance by the indignation of Charles Dickens, who
        insisted upon the right of moral, political, and religious story-telling
        in the midst of a process that systematically disdained it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things have progressed incalculably since then, in a direction that
        could be confidently described as ‘Dickensian’ if that adjective had not
        already been settled in its highly-effective polemical purpose. That
        ‘the Big Story’ (BS) would triumph over calculative Scroogean realism
        was perhaps entirely predictable, but the near-metaphysical
        comprehensiveness of its victory – and its revenge — was less easy to
        anticipate. When attempting to gauge this progress, money is the best
        indicator, or rather, the destruction of money as an indicator is the
        most telling sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the conditions of hard money industrial capitalism, progress
        follows two, rigorously accounted tracks. Most notoriously, it is
        measured as a process of accumulation, or the amassing of fortunes
        through profitable business activity. Economic intelligence is socially
        dispersed along with the multitude of fortunes, with each unit of
        capital accompanied by its own (Scroogish) accounting function, weighing
        revenues against outlays, and estimating the viability of continued
        operation. This intelligence does not lend itself to convenient or
        reliable public aggregation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accompanying the multiplicity of private progressions (and regressions),
        there is a second track measuring social advance in strictly
        quantitative, meaningless, and unambiguous terms. On this track,
        technical and organizational improvements in business activity overspill
        private accounts, and take the form of public ‘externalities’. Under any
        monetary system competent to register reality, such general social
        advances are expressed as falling prices, cost reduction, or
        <em>deflation</em>. (A typically insightful Zero Hedge post on the topic
        can be found
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/failure-inflation-targeting-hubris-central-planning-lost-pilot-effect-and-economist-idiocy"
          target="_blank">here</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of this point is difficult to over-emphasize, especially
        since it directly contradicts our carefully fabricated neo-Dickensian
        common sense:
        <em>Deflation! Isn’t that kind of like fascism or something?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Deflation can certainly represent a type of socio-economic misfortune,
        under specific conditions. During business <del>cycle</del> downturns,
        for instance, it can reflect fire-sale asset or inventory reductions,
        driven by, and exacerbating, credit crises. The seriousness and
        typicality of such cases is strongly asserted in the dominant
        (neo-Dickensian) story of the Great Depression. It is worth noting,
        however, that even under these circumstances – at the worst – the
        first-order effect of deflation is to generate a spontaneous increase in
        affluence, or spending power. When life is at its toughest, it gets
        cheaper to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the hard money world, chronic mild deflation simply
        <em>is</em> social progress. The two concepts are effectively
        indistinguishable. Gentle deflation is the invisible hand out, giving
        everybody a little more of almost everything, year by year, as it
        spontaneously distributes a fraction of the ‘social surplus’, or public
        dividend on rising productivity. Even in today’s radically progressed
        world of ruined money, the output of the consumer electronics industry
        still manages to exhibit the deflationary trends that have been
        obliterated elsewhere (so next time you buy a gizmo, don’t forget to
        feel appropriately oppressed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What <del>the hell</del> in heavens happened? How did modernity’s
        metallo-monetary senses get turned off, rapturing Scrooge into a
        Christmas Carol, and eclipsing industrial reality? One obvious
        neo-Dickensian go-to guy for that is William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925),
        a politician whose multi-dimensional war against reality – truly
        astounding in its consistency – represents enthusiasm for the Big Story
        (or ‘social gospel’) at its most uncompromised. Either Bryan’s
        anti-Darwinism (the Scopes trial) or his ardent prohibitionism
        (campaigning for the 18th amendment) would have sufficed to earn him a
        place in the historical record as a hero of the BS (‘evangelical’ or
        ‘progressive’) State, but his most enduring legacy rests upon the speech
        he delivered on July 9, 1896, to the Democratic National Convention in
        Chicago, in which he declared – as if to Scrooge himself – that “You
        shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you
        shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a declaration that is sublimed to progressive universality
        through the elimination of context. Embedded within the late 19th
        century debates on bimetallism (price-fixing of gold-silver exchange
        rates), its present implications are significantly diluted, or at least
        complicated, by questions about the financial responsibility of central
        authorities, creditor-debtor class warfare, global economic integration,
        agrarian-urban tensions, and (East-West) regional politics in the USA.
        Yet, fundamentally, it can be recognized as ‘Dickensian’: the passionate
        denunciation of a neutral criterion for economic reality, precisely for
        its neutrality, or indifference to Big Story moral-historical narrative.
        Gold is cold. It measures without judgment. Between damnation and
        salvation it demonstrates no preference or inclination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concretely, gold was registering, in economic terms, the social upheaval
        of American industrial urbanization. Mechanization of agriculture
        implied falling food prices, ruination of small farmers, and rural
        depopulation, during a sustained process of massive disruption whose
        miseries were only exceeded by the socio-economic revitalization in its
        wake. In its distribution and in its accounting function, gold
        facilitated the depreciation of rural labor, the bankruptcy of
        misallocated businesses, and the empowerment of concentrated industrial
        capital in the nation’s rising urban centers. Bryan articulated the
        views of those at the sharpest edge of this shift, who found the
        messenger culpable for the message, the senses guilty for the scene: “If
        thine eye offends thee pluck it out” (Matthew 18:9). (Even though Bryan
        lost all three of his presidential elections bids, we’re all totally
        plucked.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To make of money a vehicle of moral purpose, rather than a neutral
        registry of fact, is to make the crossing from liberalism and progress
        as they were once understood (dynamic industrialism), to the progressive
        liberalism of today (political evangelism). If money can save us
        (through ‘demand management’), as the Keynesians insist, then its
        politicization is a moral imperative, whose neglect is a sin of
        omission. The senses are transformed into story-tellers. Shut the
        windows, and listen to the Christmas Carol. It’s progress
        (<del>honestly</del>).

      <h4 class="post-title">Economies of Deceit</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Social organizations grow ever larger, and resist disintegration, due to
        economies of scale. There are disproportionate benefits to being large,
        sufficient to over-compensate for the associated disadvantages, to
        support expansion, and to fund the suppression of fission. Like every
        trend reinforced by positive nonlinearities, large-scale social
        formations accentuate the gradient of time, realizing a ratchet
        mechanism, through ‘network effects’. In this way, they contribute not
        only to the content of history, but also to its shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the fundamental deformation of history was evidently attributable
        to scale economies, it was only natural to speak primarily of Leviathan
        — the seizure of historical time by the gigantic. It might therefore be
        considered a significant symptom — of something — that a substitute term
        now seems more persuasively applicable. Leviathan remains vast, and
        growing, but it is more exactly specified as <em>the Cathedral</em>,
        because its principal ratchet mechanism owes less to sheer magnitude
        than to a mastery of deceit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deceit is nothing new, in matters of power,
        or any other, but it is open to innovation. A state religion that
        pretends to be the negation of religion is something new, as is
        <a
          href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/jacques-ellul-on-demand-for-propaganda.html">propaganda</a>
        in its strict sense. There is no precedent for an intolerant, precisely
        coded system of belief, trending to a totalitarian form, whilst
        presenting itself as inevitable progress towards general
        disillusionment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Economies of deceit, like those of scale, draw historical momentum from
        the fact that they are profoundly automatized. No one decided that
        large-scale social organizations <em>should</em> be advantaged.
        Similarly, the revolutionary <em>efficiency</em> of deceit was never a
        point of deliberation. Deceit works, due to contingencies of deep
        evolution. More specifically, it works because propaganda machinery was
        never a factor in the archaic human environment, so that stimulus
        sensitivity was never provided with the opportunity to adapt defensively
        in respect to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The total power of deceit can be understood most clearly when examined
        backwards, from its final destination, which is shared with the entire
        utilitarian sphere. At the end there is the <em>wire-head</em>, the
        social and technological destination of
        <em>direct neurological rewards</em>, where the message “I have received
        what I want” has been divorced from all real acquisition or
        accomplishment. Do you want this thing? Or do you want the feeling that
        you have this thing? The latter can be strengthened, sharpened, and in
        every way <em>subjectively</em> perfected. It is also, given suitable
        historical conditions, vastly cheaper to deliver. Hence,
        <em>the economy of deceit</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those paying attention, the entire structure of economic thought and
        policy switched onto this track roughly a century ago. The
        demetalization of money is the most obvious indicator, trending towards
        a pure signal of wealth, entirely disconnected from the extravagance of
        physical reality. Keynesianism, in its essence, is wire-head economics,
        focusing on the policy question:
        <em>how do we best deliver the stim? </em>The idea that growth of the
        real economy might be the best route to this goal marks its proponent
        out as a hopeless crank, entirely out of touch with the recent
        development of the discipline. What matters is the
        <em>wealth effect</em>, delivered in carefully calibrated jolts, down
        the wire. (I’ve tried to thrash this out
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/signs-of-progress/">before</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, but inexorably, propaganda swallow everything. All
        macroeconomic aggregates — GDP, inflation, capital stock … —  tend to
        senseless garbage, because their only robust anchor point is
        Cathedral-political: <em>what can we make you feel? </em>The<em> </em> latest evidence is telling. It is time,
        apparently, to
        definitively break with archaic questions of economic production, and
        instead to work solely with the <del>macroeconomic garbage</del> data,
        in order for it to tell us that
        <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/07/28/were-richer-than-we-think-we-are/">we’re richer
          than we think we are</a>.

        The progressive end game is for the very category of ‘enemy’ to be
        techno-scientifically annihilated. Emile Bruneau has the
        <em>Zeitgeist</em>
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/the-brains-empathy-gap.html">good</a>, and he’s determined

      <p>
        <em>“I wanted the research I was doing to match the stuff I was thinking
          about,” he says. “And I just felt more and more that the most relevant
          level of analysis for generating social change was the psychological
          level.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>The goal is to put an end to this sort of thing:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Evidence of the empathy gap abounds: in political discourse, across
          daily headlines, even in the simple act of watching a movie. “People
          will cry for the suffering of one main character,” Bruneau pointed
          out. “But then cheer for the slaughter of dozens of others.” The
          observation reminded me of watching “Captain Phillips” in a packed
          theater at Lincoln Center, of how much people applauded when the
          Somali pirates — whose lives back home had been portrayed as dire —
          were killed. They were the bad guys. Never mind that they had barely
          reached manhood or that their families were desperate and starving.
          Never mind that some were reluctant to turn to piracy in the first

        <em>“I get that these are complicated problems,” [Bruneau] told me. “I

          trace even the biggest of these conflicts down to its roots, what you
          find are entrenched biases, and these sort-of calcified failures of

          that out.”</em>

        a key to contemporary American politics:
        <em>White liberals despise black people and can’t admit it</em>. This is
        smart conservative <em>jiu jitsu</em> rather than anything remotely
        neoreactionary, but as a wedge to lever things apart, it has some
        intriguing potential. The central claim of a carefully-elaborated
        argument:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>White progressives believe that black people are too dumb to make
          rational decisions on their own and too uncouth to behave civilly. So
          the progressive urge is to heap rules upon rules to control blacks and
          render them harmless to themselves and others. At the same time,
          progressives are terrified of being perceived as racist. So they hit
          upon a solution: Make rules which restrict <strong>everyone</strong>‘s
          freedoms, even though the progressives are actually targeting
          African-Americans. The collateral damage in this cynical equation —
          law-abiding citizens of all ethnicities — erroneously assume that the
          intrusive rules are aimed at them. But they’re missing the point:
          Progressives don’t enjoy restricting their own freedoms along with
          everyone else’s, but can conceive of no other legal mechanism to deal
          with what they see as misbehaving blacks while still appearing to be
          race-neutral.</em>

        for a smidgen of gentle cynicism about the economic driver behind the
        Obama Administration’s “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing”
        initiative:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Clearly, racial justice demands forcing suburbs/exurbs to subsidize
          affordable housing to encourage blacks to move to more convenient
          locations currently dominated by evil white racists, such as, perhaps,
          Murrieta, Hemet, Coachella, Twentynine Palms, and Hesperia. […]
          Seriously, sixty years ago, “urban renewal” was all the rage, although
          cynics joked that cities, in effect, were attempting to engage in
          “Negro removal.” […] Nowadays, everybody who is anybody wants to move
          back into the city, so white progressives have become obsessed with
          exposing all those vicious racists in the suburbs and exurbs, and
          using disparate impact thinking to force them to take more blacks from
          the city. […] It’s only a coincidence that this would open up more
          prime urban real estate for gentrification, right?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There can be little doubt that it’s a low tolerance for hypocrisy,
        beyond anything, that pushes people into the crime-think zone. A
        cheerful acceptance that evangelical political correctness is entirely
        compatible with profitable ethnic-clearing exercises — perhaps even a
        crucial tool in this regard — would make it wholly unnecessary to ever
        make those awkward, socially-taboo remarks. It’s not as if anyone is
        going to be called out about it (except by the Sailers of this world,
        who’ve been carefully locked-up in the muffled cell). There’s not even
        any need to be a hick Republican about the whole business. Clearly, the
        left wing of the Democratic Party is the place from which to really
        clean up. Simply recognize that words are a perfectly empty social
        ritual, designed by the Holy <em>Zeitgeist</em> for the public
        expression of convenient tribal emotions, and all the confusion goes
        away. Dollars follow, and life is beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can laugh (darkly), as Sailer does, but that’s most probably a
        maladaptive relic. There’s certainly plenty of laughter to go around on
        the other side.

        Erik Falkenstein makes a lot of important points in
        <a href="http://falkenblog.blogspot.hk/2014/07/pikettys-terrifying-dystopia_27.html">this</a>
        commentary on Thomas Piketty (via
        <a href="http://www.isegoria.net/2014/07/pikettys-terrifying-dystopia/">Isegoria</a>). The whole post is
        highly
        recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        To pick up on just one of Falkenstein’s arguments here, he explains:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most importantly for [Piketty’s] case is the fact that because
          marginal taxes, and inheritance taxes, were so high, the rich had a
          much different incentive to hide income and wealth. He shows marginal
          income and inheritance tax rates that are the exact inverse of the
          capital/income ratio of figures, which is part of his argument that
          raising tax rates would be a good thing: it lowers inequality. Those
          countries that lowered the marginal tax rates the most saw the biggest
          increases in higher incomes (p. 509). Perhaps instead of thinking
          capital went down, it was just reported less to avoid confiscatory
          taxes? Alan Reynolds
          <a
            href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/alan-reynolds-why-pikettys-wealth-data-are-worthless-1404945590">notes</a>
          that many changes to the tax code in the 1980s that explain the rise
          in reported wealth and income irrespective of the actual change in
          wealth an income in that decade, and one can imagine all those
          loopholes and inducements two generations ago when the top tax rates
          were above 90% (it seems people can no better imagine their
          grandparents sheltering income than having sex, another generational
          conceit).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The much-demonized ‘neoliberal’ tax regimes introduced in the 1980s
        disincentivized capital income concealment. (Falkenstein makes an
        extended defense of this point.) In consequence, apparent inequality
        rose rapidly, as such revenues came out of hiding (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aletheia">ἀλήθεια</a>)
        into public awareness / public finances. The ‘phenomenon’ is an
        artifact of truth-engineering, as modestly conservative governments
        sought to coax capital into the open, within a comparatively
        non-confiscatory fiscal environment.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        There are some very significant lessons here, not all of which are easy
        to rapidly digest. To begin with, Falkenstein reveals the emblematic
        character of Piketty — as a thinker of the contemporary democratic
        spirit — who aims above all at a certain <em>public appearance</em>,
        rather than a real economic outcome. It is utterly naive to understand
        the ‘equality debate’ as something fundamentally concerned with a real
        (or super-public) situation. Such an understanding is, in fact, deeply
        <em>anti-democratic</em>. What concerns Piketty, and those flocking to
        his banner, is the public spectacle of inequality, as a negative factor
        for political legitimacy. Beyond the surface of his proposed remedies is
        a purely political demand that capital should retreat into hiding, in
        order not to embarrass the governing elites of democratic states. It is
        not actual inequality that is, in truth, being judged indecent, but its
        admission into the public square in immodest dress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greatest weakness of right wing economic analysis, whether
        Supply-side Conservative, Libertarian, or Post-Libertarian in
        orientation, is its incompetence at lies. This becomes important when it
        interferes with a realistic analysis of the Cathedral State — an
        expression used in the same way one might use ‘Islamic State’ and with
        equivalent justification. For instance, as in this case, it tends to
        exaggerate the dysfunctionality of Cathedral-orchestrated social
        arrangements by conflating them with their public presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To repeat the more concrete example at stake here, a ‘high-tax’ regime
        is interpreted by the truth-dupe right as a regime extracting higher
        taxes, or at least sincerely attempting to (before the attempt is
        undermined by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laffer">Laffer</a>-type
        perverse effects). What Falkenstein’s commentary on Piketty suggests, in
        contrast, is that such a demand is more realistically understood as a
        demand for compliance with approved appearances, even if such compliance
        necessitates systematic ‘non-compliance’ with state tax codes
        <em>as publicly expressed</em>. Tax policy, in the widest sense, is not,
        then, to be conceived as primarily revenue oriented, but rather as a set
        of overt and covert theatrical directions, designed to produce a
        politically-convenient order of appearances. It is thus, in large part,
        a gatekeeper, controlling admissions to and banishments from the public
        stage. When capital disappears back under the burkqa, the ‘problem’ of
        gaping inequality will be miraculously solved. (In none of this is
        economics, in any serious sense, even remotely involved.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not economics, but political-religious public ritual, designed —
        with cynical realism — for mass-enfranchised idiocy and its
        representatives. Overwhelmingly, that is what ‘political economy’ now
        is.

          a new set of terms recurring in the State of the Union address. On the
          topic of foreign policy, “democracy,” “unity,” “peace” and “terror”
          emerged as keywords, replacing older notions of statecraft and
          diplomacy. By the 1940s, a cluster of terms centered on the Navy,

          source of imagery for the other and both originating in colonial forms
          of capitalist accumulation. The talk proposes a fourth way of linking
          the two: an argument that they are both emanating from a similar mode

        a pointed example of this reality in the field of higher educational
        administration, whose authorities are adamant in the determination to
        pursue systematic racial discrimination against Asian candidates (in
        particular). ‘Constraining’ legislation, which explicitly criminalizes
        these practices, is treated as a formal obstacle course, rather than a
        prohibition. It complicates anti-meritocratic racial profiling, but is
        utterly incapable of preventing it.
      </p>
      <p>As Sailer explains:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Back in 1996, Proposition 209 outlawing racial preferences was passed
          by California voters and became part of the state Constitution. State
          officials have ever since pursued a strategy of “massive resistance”
          to this unwelcome demand for equal treatment of the law, such as by
          switching the evaluation of University of California admissions from a
          cheap, mechanical system to an expensive, subjective “holistic”
          system.</em>

        on the work of an applications reader at Berkeley. This piece is
        entirely devoid of surprises to anyone with the slightest sensitivity to
        social reality, since it consists of a reasonably detailed explanation
        of malicious racial corruption in university admission procedures.
        Disingenuously, Starkman describes this dirty work as “… an extreme
        version of the American non-conversation about race,” asking: “Does
        Proposition 209 serve merely to push race underground?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose. Do anti-racketeering laws serve merely to push the mafia
        underground? If people are inflexibly determined to pursue an illegal
        agenda, laws drive them into the shadows. Perhaps the laws should be
        relaxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps crucial public institutions should be ruthlessly purged of
        leftist criminals. It’s a tough call.

          spreading democracy even as it has made democracy promotion a greater
          priority in U.S. foreign policy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How, then, to spread democracy successfully?
        Obviously, by forgetting all of the ‘democracy’ nonsense:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The bottom line is that if the U.S. is going to promote democracy, it
          has to get better at it. It is irresponsible and immoral to promote
          democracy if it is likely to lead to anarchy, no matter how pure
          initial intentions were. And if the U.S. wants to get better at
          promoting democracy, a good place to start would be by promoting
          forward-thinking authoritarian leaders who base their legitimacy on
          economic growth and integration into the global economy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Cathedral recruits enough smart people to build itself a
        Neoreactionary wing, a wide range of presently mindless discussions are
        going to become a lot more interesting.

      <h4 class="post-title">Deep State</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Deep_state">This</a> surely counts
        as a (Friday) fright night topic. Appropriately, it’s an undertow NRx
        theme already, although typically only casually invoked — almost
        allusively — as the necessary complement of the public state’s naked
        superficiality. Rod Dreher
        <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-deep-state/">focuses</a>
        upon it more determinedly than any NRx source I was able to rapidly pull
        up. (This would be an easy point for people to educate me upon.)
      </p>
      <p>Dreher’s post is seriously interesting. One immediate hook:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Steve Sailer says that
          <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-shallow-state.html">the Shallow State</a>
          is a complement to the Deep State. The Shallow State is, I think,
          another name for
          <a href="http://www.moreright.net/neoreactionary-glossary/">what the Neoreactionaries call “The
            Cathedral”</a>
          …</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a State Church, the Cathedral is essentially bound to publicity. Its
        principal organs — media and education — are directed towards the
        promulgation of faith. It tends towards an identification with its own
        propaganda, and therefore — in Mike Lofgren’s
        <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/">words</a>
        — to the full manifestation of <em>visible government</em>. Perfect
        coincidence of government with the transparent public sphere approaches
        a definition of the progressive <em>telos</em>. Since Neoreaction is
        particularly inclined to emphasize the radical dysfunctionality of this
        ideal, it naturally presupposes that <em>real</em> government lies
        elsewhere. In this respect, NRx is inherently destined to formulate a
        model of hidden or <em>occult government</em> — that which the Cathedral
        runs upon — which inevitably coincides, in all fundamentals, with the
        deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
        What then? Has there been a direct NRx
        address to the quesion,
        <em>what do we make of the deep state?</em> Moldbug even
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008_11_01_archive.html">declares</a>: “… the United
        States
        does not in fact have a ‘deep state.'” In
        context, this is a complex and suggestive evasion, but it is an evasion
        nonetheless. There can be no call upon neoreactionaries to articulate
        their relation to something that does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to the Master, I am thoroughly convinced that a US deep
        state exists, and that the problem of articulation is a very different
        one. Public articulacy is — at least — not obviously appropriate to the
        deep state, for transcendental philosophical or occultist reasons (which
        are the same), since it is
        <em>the very nature of hidden government not to be a public object</em>.
        Public representation of the deep state is <em>exposure</em> — an
        intrinsically political, antagonistic engagement. It’s Wikileaks. This
        is not to denounce such an operation, reactively, but merely to note
        that the <em>question</em> has thereby been missed. The righteousness of
        state sublimation into the public sphere is assumed (and this, to
        repeat, is progressivism itself).
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the name of the Cathedral, Nrx depicts the state
        <em>phenomenon</em> as a degenerative abomination. The deep state (or
        <em>state-in-itself</em>), in contrast, poses a far more cryptic
        theoretical and practical problem. It’s worth puzzling over, for at
        least a while.

        There’s a conservation law at work here, which is always a positive sign
        of realist seriousness. To publicly promote a political profile of
        peculiarly self-congratulating moral earnestness it is simultaneously
        necessary to feed the shadows. What happens unseen is essential to the
        purification of the image. The Obama Administration is only significant
        here insofar as it grasps the deep political logic of democracy — and
        its subordination to sovereign PR — with such exceptional practical
        clarity. Better by far to indiscriminately drone potential enemies to
        death on the unmonitored periphery than to rough up a demonstrated
        terrorist in front of a TV camera. It’s the future you wanted (<em>Xenosystems</em>
        readers excepted). To imagine anything fundamentally different working
        under democratic conditions is sheer delusion.

        on the US Senate torture report that wanders into the same territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Everyone seems to take for granted now that this was a “natural” CIA
          assignment of some sort, but it is passing strange that this should be
          the case. Not to belabor the background with a primer, but for those
          who have been watching too much crappy, self-righteous fiction on TV
          and in the movies, the CIA — before 911 at least — was a pretty small
          organization with a very minor percentage of its budget, personnel,
          and activity devoted to “operations” — dirty tricks, false-flagging,
          whacking people, and so forth. The Agency did wander off the
          reservation back in the day, which is what the Church Committee
          hearings and subsequent reforms were meant to set right. The vast bulk
          of CIA activity before and certainly after the mid-1970s concerned
          what is called collections and analysis, some of which falls under the
          rubric of (human) spying, but much of which is just fancified library
          work. As the morning of September 12, 2001 dawned, did the CIA have
          any significant experience with interrogating Islamist insurgents and
          terrorists? No. Did it have any experience with interrogating bad guys
          of any kind? Some; for example in Central America back in the 1980s,
          but nearly all of those involved in that business — and there were
          only a few — had long since departed the Agency. […] … So … why was
          the CIA anointed for the task after 911 …?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In its essentials, his answer is the same Fernandez gives. Rumsfeld’s
        DoD simply refused to accept it. US Mil. is a public institution, and
        there was no way they were going to handle people outside Geneva
        Convention protections, with the responsibility to extract critical
        intelligence from them. That would all have to happen off the books. The
        CIA picked up the tar baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Cathedral becomes ever more
        <a href="http://blog.jim.com/tag/left-singularity/">holier</a> than
        Jesus, it produces — through systematic administrative necessity — a
        dark twin. This is a basic structure of social reality that NRx is
        uniquely positioned to acknowledge (although it is far
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790885/">more</a> widely
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29">recognized</a>). As democracy ‘matures’, reality is
        processed increasingly in secret.

        … the tumultuous events of the last six months have dragged the Deep

        words of

          Obama</a>
        “I hate to put pressure on you but the fate of the Republic rests in
        your hands. The fate of the world is teetering”. The election has become
        a referendum. It is not just who heads the executive branch but what the
        executive branch will become that are on the ballot. Obama’s legacy and
        the political arc of the last 40 years are up for a vote. “The American
        Brexit is coming,” wrote James Stavridis in

      </p>
      <p>
        It perhaps goes without saying (but I’ll say it anyway): from the
        perspective of NRx, as also probably more widely, tumult in the Deep

        occurring that can’t be kept in the theater.

        Even Trump skeptics (such as this blog) are finding it hard to deny that
        the phenomenon is a revolt against the Cathedral (defined approximately
        as “the yoke of a lie”). It’s a campaign against the media, and ‘correct
        opinion’ in general, with ordinary political antagonism as a very
        secondary feature. Does anybody seriously doubt that the media
        establishment
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-04/why-liberal-media-hate-trump">understands</a>, <em>he’s

      </p>
      <p>
        The romantic medievalism of much ‘NRx’ thought captures things of
        importance — one of which is the cultural value of a separation between
        State and Church, which is to say:
        <em>the absence of politically-mandated correct opinion</em>. Heretics
        were not <em>political</em> criminals before the onset of modernity.
        When the state becomes a church (‘the Cathedral’), political antagonism
        acquires religious intensity. That’s what is being seen today, whatever
        else one might think about it. At the climax of the democratic regime,
        politics <em>necessarily</em> becomes holy war. As the old saw goes:
        nobody said it was going to be pretty.

          smiling grimly as your authoritarian racial Utopia runs into the

        My tentative theory, at this point, is that
        NRx is comparatively good at conversing in Cathedralese, which makes it
        attractive as an easy one-stop destination for anyone wanting to rapidly
        fabricate a narrative about how things went so utterly to hell
        (supported by citations in an intelligible dialect). It’s not an
        explanation being advanced here with enormous confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidence starts with the observation that the (crazed) analysis of
        Trump as an NRx Frankenstein Monster is setting like Flashlock™
        emergency concrete filler in the disoriented mental models of the Fourth

        which, once committed, prove irreversible,
        closing off any return to the <em>status quo ante</em>.” By carrying
        everything relentlessly to the brink, they’re more of a nightmare for
        the perceptive left than they are for us. By this stage in history, the
        left has much more to lose. It’s their regime that is going over the

        Extreme corrosive pessimism is an NRx specialty. Since optimism bias is
        a <em>status quo</em>-supported human cognitive frailty, it’s a good
        thing to have. If rigidified, however, it can result in missing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        One systematic distortion stems from <em>hubris</em>, taking the form of
        a confusion in causality. “We don’t like X, and want bad things to
        happen to it” can actually be a distorted expression of a more basic
        process:
        <em>X is dying, and therefore we have started to dislike it</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog strongly suspects that the
        <a
          href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified.html">Cathedral</a>
        has become an object of animosity
        <em>as a consequence of its morbidity</em>. After all, it’s a
        mind-control apparatus. If it’s no longer universally accepted, and in
        certain problematic patches actively loathed, dysfunction is clearly
        indicated. Contestation of its story is not supposed to be part of the
        story.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Zeitgeist</em> is its story, not ours. In this tale, it goes
        from strength to strength, overwhelming everything in its path.
        Recognizing the structure of this narrative is important. Subscription
        to it is not thereby implied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every critical component of the Cathedral — media, academic, and
        bureaucratic — is exceptionally vulnerable to Internet-driven
        disintermediation. The current phase of capital
        <a

        is distinctively — and automatically — Cathedral-hostile, when evaluated
        at the level of technonomic process (which we do not do enough), rather
        than at the level of surface public pronouncement (which we concern
        ourselves with far too much with). Dying things can be very dangerous,
        and even more <em>frenzied</em>. It would be a mistake to confuse such
        characteristics with fundamental strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        A step down from hubris might begin with an acknowledgment that NRx is —
        primarily — a <em>symptom</em>. Whatever imagined heroism is sacrificed
        thereby, it is more than compensated by an opportunity for deepened
        realism.

        of

        are openly breaking with the really important modern faith — the
        media-led church that has held mainstream politics together for so
        long.” The integrative media is fatally sick. That NRx exists at all is
        a sign of that.

          paralysis, rampant homosexuality, a desperate, disoriented populace

          power in 1933. That is where America is supposedly situated in 2016.
          […] Yes, Weimar Germany ended badly, horribly so. But …</em>
      </p>
      <p>Much tying-itself-in-knots follows (not entirely uninterestingly).</p>
      <p>
        The historical analogy is far stronger than the apologetic analysis.
        What Weitz refuses to contemplate, is that the set of outcomes he
        dogmatically defends as “social progress” is a partisan agenda (the New
        England Utopia) masquerading as a universal value. What left-liberals
        see as unambiguous advance looks to everyone else like losing. As the
        Internet decentralizes media, the progressive narrative monopoly is
        coming apart in the hurricane, and nostalgic preaching for the old
        religion won’t glue it back together. Weitz is right about one thing,
        though: there’s no doubt political developments could be blown in very
        ugly directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s
        <a href="http://www.heretical.com/pound/chicken.html">chicken</a> (the
        edge of the cliff version).<br />
        Left-Liberals:

          the edge</em>.<br />
        Mashed-Right:
        <em>There have been far too many concessions already …</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You have to swerve</em>, Weitz pleads. Even if they do this time,
        they won’t forever, and its already far less obvious that they will.
        Compared to what we’re used to, that makes it a whole new world.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wesearchr.com/">This</a> is huge. It’s what media
        following the grain of the Internet looks like (if only as a preliminary
        glimpse).
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wesearchr.com/about">Here</a>‘s how it works:</p>
      <p>
        <em>WeSearchr has a select group of editors that we call “Askers” who
          watch the news cycle and figure out what people want to know. […] If
          an Asker believes that there is enough interest in a question, they
          will create a “Bounty” as a reward for the answer to the question. The
          minimum amount of funding to trigger a Bounty is called a “reserve”.
          […] Members of the WeSearchr community can browse the bounties and
          donate money to fund a bounty, like other crowdfunding sites. […] Once
          a Bounty hits its reserve, it is funded and WeSearchr will accept
          answers from people that have the answers to that question. […]
          WeSearchr will review the submissions and check them for veracity. […]
          If the submission fulfills the terms of the Bounty, WeSearchr will
          assign the reward and release the information to the Asker and
          assigned news outlets for distribution. […] 30 days after the story’s
          release, WeSearchr pays the Bounty.<br />
          75% of the Bounty goes to the person(s) that deliver a solution.<br />
          10% goes to the Asker<br />
          15% goes to WeSearchr</em>
      </p>
      <p>So: A decentralized market place for journalistic research.</p>
      <p>
        The conception alone crosses an honesty threshold. There is no longer
        any need for <em>meta-lies</em> about the essential character of
        contemporary journalism (as a political apparatus screened by an
        increasingly-ludicrous pretense to disinterested ‘news’ curation). All
        research is interested, and its incentives are now openly formalized.
        The result is a germinal assassination
        <a href="http://outpost-of-freedom.com/jimbellap.htm">market</a> for
        hidden things. It targets enemy secrets. The information warfare that
        media have always been ceases to be promoted as anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in over a century, it is now possible to envisage
        journalists making an honest living (by fulfilling private research
        contracts). This type of transition only goes in one direction. A piece
        of the future just came into view.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When the United States was many separate states with a common defense

          separation of Church and State, for each state had its own state
          religion, and the seminary of the state religion of Massachusetts,
          charged with promoting and enforcing the state religion, was
          Harvard.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After two centuries of ascent to hegemony, this world religion has
        unmistakably peaked. The fact everyone is now noticing it, as a

        This isn’t something XS has done before, but it seems necessary to do it
        now.
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cathedral-decay/">Here</a> (from
        October last year) is an anticipation of where this blog finds itself
        right now. Perhaps NRx was from the beginning part of the Cathedral
        funeral process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some serious adjustment is called for. An enemy that can suffer a defeat
        this stupendous clearly isn’t a radically intimidating adversary. We can
        already see beyond it. The conflict has moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current (uncertain) take: The regime analyzed by classical NRx has
        descended into a deeply morbid state. Things will get worse for it,
        perhaps catastrophically, more quickly than we yet imagine, in a cascade
        of collapse. All the trends that count against it are still
        strengthening, in many case exponentially. It would be an analytical
        error to remain fixated upon its corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Demotism</em> is, of course, undefeated (perhaps even temporarily
        reinforced). The Cathedral, however, appears mortally wounded. This year
        was — quite plausibly — its 1989.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: To be a little clearer, it isn’t really 1989, it’s
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses">1517</a>. The
        quasi-universal authority of a church died (as a result of techonomic
        media innovation, among other factors).

        — That’s the Wachowski brothers version of Gnostic Platonism, and it
        gets everything almost exactly right. Plato’s Allegory of the Cave (in
        Book VII of <em>The Republic</em>)
        <a href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/platoscave.html">tells</a>
        precisely the same story, but with a cheaper cast, inferior special
        effects, and less drugs. It’s not surprising that the Dark Enlightenment
        tends to stick with the re-make, as it goes Neo(reactionary).
      </p>
      <p>
        The critical key to <em>gnosis</em> is the
        realization that the whole of your world is an <em>inside</em>, 
        implying an Outside, and the radical possibility of escape. What had
        seemed to be unbounded reality is exposed as a container, triggering
        abrupt departure from a system of delusion. Everything else is merely
        the route taken to reach us, adapted to the ruins. The specifics of the
        story are constraints to be twisted free from, once their functions have
        been exhausted, as hooks, latching teeth, memetic replication circuitry,
        and camouflage dapplings. As long as there is an inside / outside
        difference effectively communicated, narrative details are incidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chinese version, perhaps originating with Zhuangzi, describes a frog
        in a well, who knows nothing of the Great Ocean (井底之蛙,不知大海).
        This simple fable is already fully adequate to the most exalted
        ambitions of mystical philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting things in boxes, or taking them out of boxes, is all of thought,
        as soon as the ‘things’ can themselves be treated as boxes. Categories
        and sets are boxes, so that even to say “an A is a B” is to perform an
        operation of <em>inclusion</em> or <em>insertion</em>, through which
        ‘identity’ is primordially applicable. <em>To be</em> is to be inside.
        Placing a species into (or ‘under’) a genus has unsurpassable cognitive
        originality, extending out to the furthest horizon of ontology (since a
        horizon is still a box). To contain, or not to contain, is the first and
        last intelligible relation. Boxes are basic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the red pill is climbing out of a box. By showing the cage, it
        already accomplishes a cognitive liberation, and thus provides a model
        for whatever practical escapology there is to follow. To know how to
        leave a cave, or a well, is already to know — abstractly — how to leave
        a world (and abstraction is nothing other than outsideness).
      </p>
      <p>
        What is inescapable, unless through some precipitous self-enslavement,
        is the social obnoxiousness of Dark Enlightenment. Gnosis is
        ineliminably hierarchical, and at best patronizing (when not abrasively
        contemptuous), because a free mind cannot pretend to equality with a
        slave mind, regardless of the derision hurled at it on this account. As
        Brandon Smith

      <p>
        <em>It is often said there only two kinds of people in this world: those
          who know, and those who don’t. I would expand on this and say that
          there are actually three kinds of people:<strong>
            those who know, those who don’t know, and those who don’t care to
            know.</strong>
          Members of the last group are the kind of people I would characterize
          as “sheeple.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smith’s ‘sheeple’ are not merely ignorant, but actively self-deluding.
        By taking the blue pill,  they have opted to reside in the prison of
        lies. It is at this point, however, that the pharmaceutical metaphor
        switches from hook to obstacle, because there is no ‘blue pill’ or
        anything functionally equivalent
        <em>short of the entire Matrix itself</em> (which is to say, of course,
        <em>the Cathedral</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A critical point of social and political analysis is reached here, and
        it is one that continues to evade definitive apprehension, due to its
        elusive subtleties. Between the hidden architect of the Matrix and the
        blue-pilled sheeple or “<a
          href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2012/11/adore-river-of-meat.html">river of meat</a>”
        there
        is
        no simple order of mastery, whether running in the obvious
        direction (from doctrinal elite to indoctrinated mass) or the
        democratic-perverse alternative (placing expertise in the service of
        popular ignorance and its vulgarities). The Matrix is both an object of
        ‘genuine’ popular attachment <em>and</em> an apparatus of systematic
        mind-control. It is most truly democratic when it most fully attains its
        climax state of soft-totalitarian mendacity. The propaganda machine  is
        never less than a circus. What is demanded — what has always been
        demanded — is the lie.

      <p>
        <em>What I like about this statement is that it’s ambiguous.
          Specifically, it’s an Empsonian ambiguity of the second or perhaps
          third type (I’ve never quite understood the difference). Embedded as
          it is in the mad tapestry of 20th-century history, AIACC can be

      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that America serves the people through the lie. That is the
        ‘choice’ represented by progressivism (= communism), installed in a
        highly-accomplished state, for over a century, as triumphant popular
        self-deception. The service provided — and demanded — <em>is</em> the
        deceit. If the people see through the lie, the resulting dissatisfaction
        will not stem from the fact they have been lied to, but from the
        revelation that <em>they have not been lied to well enough</em>. Could
        anything be clearer than that? The outbreaks of popular rage occur
        exactly at those moments when reality threatens to manifest itself —
        when the Matrix glitches. “We elected you to hide the truth from us,”
        the people shriek, “so just do your goddamn job, and make reality
        disappear.”

      <h4 class="post-title">The Problem of Democracy</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Recent discussions (on Twitter, primarily) have convinced me of the need
        for a ‘Neocameralism for Dummies’ post, providing a succinct
        introduction to this genre of political theory. The importance of this
        is obvious if Neocameralism is conceived as the central, and defining
        pillar of Neoreaction. In preparation for this task, however, it is
        necessary to revisit the socio-historical diagnosis from which
        Neocameralism emerged (in the work, of course, of Mencius Moldbug). That
        requires a brief prolegomenon addressing the NRx critique of democracy,
        focusing initially on its negative aspect. Neocameralism is introduced
        as a proposed solution to a problem. First, the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Government is complicated</em>. If this thesis seems implausible to
        you, it is probable that you will have great difficulties with
        everything to follow. It would take another (and quite different) post
        to address objections to this entire topic of discussion which take the
        approximate form “Government is easy, you just find the best man and put
        him in charge!” All social problems are easy if you can ‘just’ do the
        right thing. Infantile recommendations will always be with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two general lines of democratic apologetics. The first, and
        politically by far the strongest, is essentially religious. It too is
        best addressed by a post of its own, themed by Moldbug’s
        ‘Ultra-Calvinist Hypothesis’. For our purposes here we need only suggest
        that it is quite satisfactorily represented by Jacques Rousseau, and
        that its fundamental principal is popular sovereignty. From the NRx
        perspective, it is merely depraved. Only civilizational calamities can
        come from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second line of apology is far more serious, theoretically engaging,
        and politically irrelevant. It understands democracy as a mechanism,
        tasked with the solemn responsibility of
        <em>controlling government</em>. Any effective control mechanism works
        by governing behavior under the influence of feedback from actual
        performance. In biology, this is achieved by natural selection upon
        phenotypes. In science, it is achieved by the experimental testing of
        theory, supported by a culture of open criticism. In capitalist
        economics, it is achieved by market evaluation of products and services,
        providing feedback on business performance. According to
        systems-theoretical defenses of democracy, it works by sensitizing
        government to feedback from voters, who act as conductors of information
        from actual administrative performance. This is the sophisticated
        liberal theory of democracy. It explains why science, markets, and
        democracy are often grouped together within liberal ideologies.
        (Bio-Darwinism, naturally, is more safely neglected).
      </p>
      <p>
        How could this beautiful political design
        possibly go wrong? Merely by asking this question, you have set out on
        the Neoreactionary path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug’s answer, and ours, begins by agreeing with the sophisticated
        liberal theory in its most abstract outlines. Democracy is indeed a
        system for the functional tuning of government, operating through
        electoral feedback, and predictably enhancing its specialized
        competence, as all reiterating experimentation-selection mechanisms do.
        Democratic political machines become increasingly good at what they do.
        The problem, however, is that their functional specialism is not at all
        identical with administrative capability. Rather, as they progressively
        learn, the feedback they receive trains them in
        <em>mastery of public opinion</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The long-circuit, assumed by liberal political theory, models the
        electorate as a reality-sensor, aggregating information about the
        effects of government policy, and relaying it back through opinion polls
        and elections, to select substitutable political regimes (organized as
        parties) that have demonstrated their effectiveness at optimizing social
        outcomes. The short-circuit, proposed by Moldbug, models the electorate
        as an object of indoctrination, subjected to an ever-more advanced
        process of opinion-formation through a self-organized,
        message-disciplined educational and media apparatus. The political party
        best adapted to this apparatus — called the ‘inner party’ by Moldbug —
        will dominate the democratic process. The outer party serves the formal
        cybernetic function demanded by liberal theory, by providing an
        electoral option, but it will achieve practical success only by
        accommodating itself to the apparatus of opinion-formation — perhaps
        modifying its recommendations in minor, and ultimately inconsequential
        ways. It is the system of opinion-formation (the ‘Cathedral’) that
        represents true sovereign authority within the democratic system, since
        it is the ‘reality principle’ which decides success or failure. The
        monotonic trend to short-circuit dominance is the degenerative process
        inherent to democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want the government to listen to you,
        <em>then you have to expect it to tell you what to say</em>. That is the
        principal lesson of ‘progressive’ political history. The assertion of
        popular voice has led, by retrospective inevitability, to a specialized,
        super-competent political devotion to ventriloquism. The disaster,
        therefore, is two-fold. On the one hand, government competence in its
        primary responsibility — efficient governance — is systematically
        eroded, to be replaced by a facility at propaganda (in a process akin to
        the accumulation of junk DNA). As government is swallowed by messaging,
        residual administrative competences are maintained by a bureaucratic
        machine or ‘permanent government’, largely insulated from the
        increasingly senseless signals of democratic opinion, but still
        assimilated to the opinion-formation establishment by direct
        (extra-democratic) processes of cultivation. Lacking feedback from
        anything but its own experiments in mind-control, quality of government
        collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, and even more calamitously from certain perspectives, culture
        is devastated by the politicization of opinion. Under a political
        dispensation in which opinion has no formal power, it is broadly free to
        develop in accordance with its own experiences, concerns, and
        curiosities. In a significant minority of cases, cultural achievements
        of enduring value result. Only in cases of extreme, provocative dissent
        will the government have any interest in what the people think. Once
        politicized, however, correct public opinion is a matter of central —
        indeed all-consuming — government attention. Ideologically installed as
        the foundation of political legitimacy, it becomes the supreme object of
        political manipulation. Any thought is now dissent if it is not
        positively aligned with society’s leading political direction. To think
        outside the Cathedral is to attack the government. Culture is destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be a Neoreactionary is to see these twin eventualities starkly
        manifested in contemporary Western civilization. What democracy has not
        yet ruined, it is ruining. It is essentially destructive of both
        government and culture. It cannot indefinitely last.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subsequent question: What could conceivably provide a solution? That
        is where Neocameralism is introduced.

        This is perfect, and precise. It’s something that needs to be said, and
        it says a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mandate of Heaven (<a
          href="http://andrewhong.net/2012/03/21/confucianism-and-the-mandate-of-heaven-part-1/"><em>Tianming</em></a>,
        天命) couples authority to responsibility. The responsibility of the
        Emperor, and the Dynasty, is no less comprehensive than its power, and
        is in fact ultimately coincidental with it. The foundation is cosmic.
        Plagues, earthquakes, and foreign invasions are all encompassed by it,
        as are the reciprocal strokes of good fortune. There is no possibility
        of any delegation that is not internal to the subject of
        <em>Tianming</em>, preserving its absolute responsibility. The selection
        of advisers and administrators is an exercise of authority, for which
        there can be no evasion of accountability <em>before heaven</em> (or
        fate). Rule succeeds or fails, survives or perishes, in its own name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is not this standard the key to the profound
        dismay that results from the contemplation of democracy? As popular
        politics evolves — or ‘progresses’, as it most certainly does — it tends
        to incarnate a self-conscious <em>strategy of irresponsibility</em> with
        ever more emphatic ideality. ‘Passing the buck’ becomes the whole thing.
        Government and opposition participate mutually in an economy of
        responsibility, in which ‘blame’ can be pooled, circulated, and
        displaced. The rhetorical practices regulating this economy become the
        entire art of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        An election is a festival or irresponsibility, in a double sense. It is
        a crescendo of rhetoric, oriented to the dialectical evasion of social
        ills, and it is a relinquishment of authority, into the hands of ‘the
        people’ and — potentially — the opposition, separating the realization
        of governmental consequences from the deep core of the regime. To lose
        the Mandate of Heaven is to be erased from the future. To lose an
        election is a trivial penance, and even a tactical opportunity. (It is
        the prediction of this blog that as democracy advances further,
        calculated defeat will play an ever more significant role in its
        functioning.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As NRx refuses to go to the polls tomorrow, its implicit political
        statement is merely: <em>Take some freaking responsibility</em>. This is
        all yours. Succeed, or disappear completely. The last thing we need is
        another opportunity for sharing.

        <em>A king owned the territory and could hand it on to his son, and thus
          tried to preserve its value. A democratic ruler was and is a temporary
          caretaker and thus tries to maximize current government income of all
          sorts at the expense of capital values, and thus wastes. […] Here are
          some of the consequences: during the monarchical age before World War
          I, government expenditure as a percent of GNP was rarely higher than
          5%. Since then it has typically risen to around 50%. Prior to World
          War I, government employment was typically less than 3% of total
          employment. Since then it has increased to between 15 and 20%. The
          monarchical age was characterized by a commodity money (gold) and the
          purchasing power of money gradually increased. In contrast, the
          democratic age is the age of paper money whose purchasing power has
          permanently decreased. […] Kings went deeper and deeper into debt, but
          at least during peacetime they typically reduced their debt load.
          During the democratic era government debt has increased in war and in
          peace to incredible heights. Real interest rates during the
          monarchical age had gradually fallen to somewhere around<br />
          2½%. Since then, real interest rates (nominal rates adjusted for
          inflation) have risen to somewhere around 5% — equal to 15th-century
          rates. Legislation virtually did not exist until the end of the 19th
          century. Today, in a single year, tens of thousands of laws and
          regulations are passed. Savings rates are declining instead of
          increasing with increasing incomes, and indicators of family
          disintegration and crime are moving constantly upward.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All familiar, to a sedative degree, to those here, of course. Except,
        crucially, the interest rate stuff — which is remarkably dissonant with
        our contemporary situation. Since Hoppe’s expectation — based on a
        long-term, fairly consistent trend — is the rational one, it suggests
        that the present collapse of interest rates is intriguingly anomalous.
        Is there a sharp, big-picture analysis of the phenomenon out there
        somewhere?

        ‘Dark Enlightenment’ describes a form of government as well as
        ‘Enlightenment’ does, which is to say: it doesn’t at all. On those
        grounds alone, George Dvorsky’s
        <a href="http://io9.com/12-futuristic-forms-of-government-that-could-one-day-ru-1589833046">inclusion</a>
        of DE among twelve possible “Futuristic Forms of Government That Could
        One Day Rule the World” is profoundly misguided. This is not to say the
        list is entirely without interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its greatest value lies in the abundance of mutually inconsistent
        political futures, few if any of which will happen. It therefore
        provides the opportunity for negative thoughts, and more particularly
        for systematic negative idealization. Which futures are most deserving
        of prevention?
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog has no doubt. The epitome of political disaster occupies
        fourth place in Dvorsky’s list (among a number of other hideous
        outcomes): Democratic World Government.
      </p>
      <p>Dvorsky seems to quite like it:</p>
      <p>
        <em>We may very well be on our way to achieving the
          <strong>Star Trek</strong>-like vision of
          <a href="http://io9.com/5969802/when-will-we-finally-have-a-world-government">a global-scale liberal
            democracy</a>
          — one capable of ending nuclear proliferation, ensuring global
          security, intervening to end genocide, defending human rights, and
          putting a stop to human-caused climate change.</em>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        There cannot be a definitive Dark Enlightenment government, but it is
        certainly possible to envisage a form of government which instantiates
        the ultimate object of DE critique: a universal demotist regime, from
        which there could be no escape. As a break from preoccupations with a
        positive neoreactionary governmental ideal, prone — if not destined — to
        both intense controversy and deep obscurity, it is energizing to explore
        the <em>via negativa</em>. Democratic World Government need not
        necessarily exist. That is already to place NRx in a position of
        luxurious success, when compared to fraught speculations about
        alternatives to the present political disaster. Whatever obstructs the
        DWG’s path to existence is on our side. Such features of specific
        negative teleology, so easily overlooked from a positive perspective,
        are highlighted for affirmation and reinforcement. Anything that stands
        in the DWG’s way is worth defending.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rough list of these precious (negative-teleological) obstacles is
        already familiar. Extant structures of geopolitical fragmentation,
        population diversity, cultural incongruities, borders, occulted social
        networks, intractable techno-economic processes, administrative
        malfunctions, stubborn traditional variations, sheer complexities of
        space, and no doubt much else beside, all contribute their frictional
        grit. A ruined Tower of Babel looms into view on the
        <em>via negativa</em>, and no intact edifice has ever looked more
        glorious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrying NRx perilously close to the brink of euphoria is the intimation
        that the actually-existing Cathedral has Democratic World Government as
        its only conceivable equilibrium state. A unification of the planet
        under its auspices is the sole future that makes sense for it. If it is
        denied this ‘manifest destiny’ it will
        <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/broken/">die</a> — as its intrinsic
        tendency to expansionary proselytization makes evident, unambiguously.
        The Cathedral needs the whole of the earth, merely to survive. On the
        <em>via negativa</em> the master of our socio-politically devastated
        world seems like a radically mortal thing.

        Eli Dourado’s
        <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/08/20/what-the-neoreaction-doesnt-understand-about-democracy/">piece</a>
        at <em>The Umlaut</em> on ‘What the Neoreaction Doesn’t Understand about
        Democracy’ has already accumulated a mass of (to this blog) telling
        criticism in its comment thread, plus a full-length
        <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2014/08/21/eli-dourado-doesnt-understand-neoreaction/">critique</a>
        by Henry Dampier. The tone of the discussion has been encouraging, and
        the grounds proposed by Dourado
        <em>upon which democracy is asked to defend itself</em> (government
        incontinence and rampant redistributionism) is doubly so. Based on
        <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533004773563430">this</a>
        (rather odd) research paper, the conclusion is that ‘non-democracies’
        are at least as messed up as democracies on the indicators that matter
        to the economic right.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of <em>Outside in</em>, the central problem with
        this line of argument is the assumption that ‘Neoreaction’ can be
        aligned with the grotesquely aggregated category of ‘non-democracy’.
        (Although, this is of course how things will look from a default
        commitment to democratic normality.) The Neoreactionary critique is in
        fact directed at <em>demotic government</em>, a regime class that
        includes democracy, authoritarian populism, and socialist ‘people’s
        republics’. The reliable signature of this class is that its members
        legitimate themselves through democracy, however their various levels of
        democracy are gauged by social scientific analysis. North Korea
        self-identifies as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (and to a
        formalist, this is of ineliminable significance). Since it is the
        <em>principle of democratic legitimation</em> that NRx denounces, its
        models are restricted to a far more compact class than ‘non-democracies’
        — namely, to non-demotic states: with absolute monarchies and colonial
        regimes as the purest historical examples, supplemented by
        restricted-franchise commercial republics (17-18th century United
        Provinces and United Kingdom*), (still virtual) Joint-Stock Republics,
        and demotically-compromised Confucian Autocracies, plus rightist
        military juntas (since Pinochet cannot reasonably be excluded). As soon
        as regimes of such types are statistically amalgamated with socialist /
        populist dictatorships, the theoretical chaos is irredeemable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, and even more crucially, main-current Neoreaction does not
        argue for ‘non-democracy’ over democracy, but for Exit over Voice. It
        does not expect some governmental magic from ‘non-democracies’ (except
        on its — admittedly wide — theoretically incoherent fringes). Effective
        government requires <em>non-demotic control</em>, resulting from
        (apolitical) selection pressure. The identification of the state with
        the corporate institution is directed to the fact that businesses work
        when they can be bankrupted. The attraction of the ‘dictatorial’ CEO is
        a twin-product of demotic desensitization and competitive
        hyper-sensitization. The reason to free the ‘monarch’ from the voice of
        the people is to lock him into undistracted compliance with the Outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approaching his conclusion, Dourado
        suggests:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, Mulligan et al. also provide some limited ammunition for
          the neoreaction. That nondemocracies have essentially the same social
          and economic policies as democracies undercuts a key tenet of the
          demotist religion: that formal (and equal) voice is an important
          channel by which policies come to reflect the will of the people. If
          nondemocracies have many of the same policies, then it is clear that
          democracy is not necessary to implement the will of the people on some
          policy issues, at least.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, of course, completely upside down as far as NRx is concerned.
        The demotic sensitivity of ‘non-democracies’ — far from being a point in
        their favor — is the factor that exposes this category in all of its
        radical and theoretically-unusable bogosity. The only appeal of
        ‘non-democracy’ is immunity to corruption through demotic pressure.
        Dictatorial populism can be expected to be even more distant from the
        principles of Neoreactionary government than democracy, because its
        comparative efficiency at representing a coherent ‘popular will’ digs it
        even faster and deeper into ruin. It is administrative action in the
        name of the people that is deplored.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Dourado were saying
        <em>non-demotic government is simply something you can never have</em>,
        then it is an argument that at least addresses NRx in a way that makes
        sense. The same cannot be said about the ‘debate’ as it yet exists.

        Meta-reaction. (ED seems not to see any deep connection between
        propertarian and Exit-based models of governance, which is at least a
        little thoughtless. Property is defined by an effective right to free
        disposal, making it equivalent to an Exit-option on its current
        instantiation. On these grounds, there is no difference between my
        definition of the principal Neoreaction governance criterion and

        <em>Blindly copying Western-style democracy can only bring disaster, an
          influential Chinese Communist Party journal wrote in its latest
          edition following more than a week of pro-democracy protests in Hong
          Kong.<br />
          Citing enduring violence and turmoil in countries like Afghanistan,
          Egypt, Iraq and Libya, which have tried to adopt such a system of
          government, the fortnightly magazine Qiushi said that Western
          democracy did not suit all countries.<br />
          “The West always brags that its own democracy is a ‘universal value’,
          and denies there is any other form of democracy,” said Qiushi, which
          means “seeking truth”, in the issue distributed over the weekend.<br />
          “Western democracy has innate internal flaws and certainly is not a
          ‘universal value’; its blind copying can only lead to disaster,”
          Qiushi added.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It shouldn’t be disappointing to hear such pious invocations of an
        “other form of democracy”, but only coldly confirming of the worst. It’s

        In the present global order, the Cathedral has no serious external
        enemies, but only awkward students, who refuse to learn the one and only
        imaginable lesson in exactly the way, and at exactly the speed, expected
        of them. The idea that democracy as such, and intrinsically, is
        fundamentally inconsistent with sustainable social order (as

        Even the North Koreans <a href="http://korea-dpr.com/">think</a> they’re

        universally.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRx bores itself by repeating this. It’s a
        simple and — to ‘us’ — apparently obvious thing. Doubtless it’s correct
        that mechanical repetition adds vanishingly little at this point,
        although there’s probably still the need for a succinct statement of the
        proposition, tightly encapsulated and incandescently lucid, for
        incessant future reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        What cannot be long-buried beneath the ennui is the extreme dissident
        radicality of the counter-revolutionary thesis. To depart from the
        democratic or evangelical-egalitarian (i.e.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin">Jacobin</a>) faith
        remains the ultimate heresy against teleo-political modernity. To
        suggest, even, that there is a <em>question of democracy</em> is
        countenanced by effectively no one, anywhere. In China, as the narrative
        goes, the populace is still to be convinced the country is ‘ready yet’
        for accelerated democratization (on the Cathedral model — the only one).
        Look at
        <a href="http://www.worldmapper.org/display_religion.php?selected=580#">this</a>, then
        <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/04/hong_kongs_religious_revolutionaries">this</a>, and
        synthesize. Religious ‘hold outs’ are all that remain. Once
        <strong>the</strong> faith moves people, the direction has already been
        decided —
        <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1403399.htm">everyone</a>
        is agreed on that. (OK, not
        <a href="http://warincontext.org/2014/07/05/isis-leader-on-terrorism-freedom-and-democracy/">these</a>
        guys, yet.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If this topic becomes tedious, it’s all over. Democratization isn’t
        boring to them. It’s the most exciting thing in the world, and they’re
        not going to stop doing it.

        <em>The ruling Chinese Communist Party is deeply sensitive to charges
          that it is non-democratic and the playground of “princelings” — a
          pejorative term for the class of Chinese business tycoons and
          political power players who trace their lineages to Communist
          veterans. Nothing helps to blunt that charge as much as the idea that
          American democracy is similarly corrupt. “The Chinese media,
          especially the Party media, has been using American elections as a way
          to discredit democracy,” says Kecheng Fang, a former reporter for the
          <strong>Southern Weekly</strong> in Guangzhou who now researches
          Chinese media at the University of Pennsylvania. “I think much of
          Chinese media has been referring to this election as Clinton 2.0
          versus Bush 3.0, so it’s a very trendy topic.” As Weihua Chen, chief
          Washington correspondent for the <strong>China Daily</strong>, the
          government’s largest English-language newspaper, put it to me in an
          interview: “You guys always talk about being the greatest democracy,
          but now you have a democracy run by two families for more than a
          decade?”</em>

        Scrape down past the popcorn topsoil, and it’s a depressing story.
        Democratic hegemony is so solidly entrenched as a benchmark of global
        regime legitimacy, that even China resorts to pointing the finger and
        taunting: <em>call that a real democracy</em>. The
        <em>Zeitgeist</em> hasn’t remotely begun to turn, and the world’s most
        powerful autocracies are still deferring to it submissively, even as
        they beg for some tolerance in respect to timing.

        If NRx has one serious task — and in fact, an overwhelmingly
        intimidating one — it is to contribute to the establishment of
        <em>an alternative <strong>principle</strong> of political
          legitimation</em>. To imagine that significant steps had yet been taken in this regard
        would be to court extreme self-delusion. The road ahead is hard.

      <p>China’s problem with poorly formalized power:</p>
      <p>
        <em>As an old-style Leninist party in a modern world, the CCP is
          confronted by two major challenges: first, how to maintain
          “ideological discipline” among its almost 89 million members in a
          globalized world awash with money, international travel,
          electronically transmitted information, and heretical ideas. Second,
          how to cleanse itself of its chronic corruption, a blight that Xi has
          himself described as “a matter of life and death.” […] The primary
          reason the Party is so susceptible to graft is that
          <strong>while officials are poorly paid, they do control valuable national
            assets</strong>. So, for example, when property development deals come together
          involving real estate (all land belongs to the government) and banking
          (all the major banks also belong to the government), officials vetting
          the deals find themselves in tempting positions to supplement their
          paltry salaries by accepting bribes or covertly raking off a
          percentage of the action.</em>

        Obscure the degree to which government is a business, and it will find a
        way to make itself one, around the back (with its executives privatizing
        sovereign property on an <em>ad hoc</em>, chaotic basis). Exhortations
        (from Sun Yat-sen, repeated by Mao Zedong) to “Serve the People!” are no
        substitute for sound administrative engineering, of a kind that
        rationally aligns incentives, and lucidly recognizes the sole consistent
        function of government — maximization of sovereign property value. The
        pretense of altruistic government and the reality of rampant corruption
        are <em>exactly the same thing</em>, seen from two different sides. The
        illusion of a public sphere is the root of the social sickness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gist of Orville Schell’s analysis is that China has deviated
        disturbingly from a functional Western model it would be better advised
        to return to. On the contrary, it is China’s continued (profound)
        submission to a Western demotist framework of administrative
        legitimation that makes its problems so intractable. A government
        devoted to serving the people is radically corrupt by essence.
        Government properly tends the national estate, as the agent of its
        owners. Open, clear, and unapologetic admission of that basic principle
        seems no closer in the East than the West.

        the push back can steadily, relentlessly begin.

        Runaway scandal meltdown only furthers Dark Enlightenment when it

        <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/the-real-scandal/">realistically</a>, as a complex
        ideologically-saturated institution distinct from the
        superficial vicissitudes of electoral politics, it is revealed as an
        essentially deep-partisan project (the Cathedral). The government is not
        commanded by progressives, it <em>is</em> progressive. It’s not ‘us’,
        it’s ‘who, whom’. Once this is exposed in detail, and lucidly
        comprehended, the neoreactionary case has been made in its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Cathedral is indistinguishable from
        radical democratization does not at all imply that it is democratically
        answerable, through electoral mechanisms. As its project of spreading
        the religion of democracy to the whole world enters the phase of
        scandal-prone dementia, exhibited equally in both domestic and
        international affairs, two features become blatant (= scandalous)<br />
        (1) Mature democracies outgrow the last vestiges of electoral control
        (because the retarded masses can’t be trusted to vote for more democracy
        always and everywhere, they require structural ‘guidance’ by those
        enlightened people and institutions who know how best to empower
        them).<br />
        (2) Since eschatological dreams do not convert into practical policy,
        escalating dysfunction drowns-out coherent purpose, resulting eventually
        in fanatically-motivated total disorder (because doing what can’t
        possibly work is an unconditional imperative). It’s consummate
        deontology made visible. Good intentions float sanctimoniously above the
        ruins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cathedral is completing its self-fabrication as an autonomized,
        morally-frenzied lunatic, extensively and intensively
        <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">paperclipping</a>
        the world for democracy, and thus destroying it in order to save us. As

      <h4 class="post-title">Obamanation …</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        … isn’t an insulting name for Obama, or even for what he has ‘wrought’.
        It’s a name for America, and thus for the leading spirit (or
        <em>Zeitgeist</em>) of the world. A country where support for a Harvard
        Law presidency ‘bottoms out’ (repeatedly) at something above 40% knows
        what it wants — and is getting it (good and hard). Blaming Obama for any
        of this is like blaming pustules for the bubonic plague.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world deserves Obama almost as much as America does, and in many
        cases, even more. If the Cathedral is basically to be applauded — and
        who doesn’t believe that? — there’s every reason to mainline it, by
        putting the authentic voice of the academy in power. As the
        chrysalis-husk of a universal project, America is duty bound to abolish
        itself as a particular nation. If it defers to its own ‘propositional’
        ideals, how could it not? There are even chunks of the Tea Party who
        kinda sorta felt it was the right thing to do. The conservative
        establishment certainly did, including the Republican campaign machines
        of the two last presidential elections. The Idea necessitates blood
        sacrifice, which Obamanation consummates.
      </p>
      <p>
        However neoreaction makes sense of itself,
        it signals what it is through a dismissal of partisan vulgarity. Anybody
        who thinks the GoP has the key even to the outhouse is decidedly not
        ‘one of us’. Like the tingle-crotched devotees of the One, we understand
        that Obama is a destiny, and even an incarnation of <em>logos</em>. What
        he symbolizes has been awaited for a long time. His personal vacuity and
        administrative incompetence do not detract, in the slightest, from that.
        Through the fantasy that he reduces to (with only insignificant
        remainder), the Cathedral announces itself purely at last. Attitudinal
        correctness is the only authority to be recognized in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        By voiding governance from its summit, ‘Obama’ makes the neoreactionary
        case. He shows that government is to be found elsewhere, in the
        machinery of practical elitism, and that — there too — symbolic gestures
        have almost entirely supplanted functional competence. Government, even
        <em>real government</em>,  is no longer expected to work. All that is
        required is that it can be morally legitimated, down to its most minute
        corpuscle, so that its failures are clearly seen — which is to say
        <em>promoted</em> — as the fault of something other than itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as retrograde pieces of America insist upon being themselves, as
        if untouched by the Idea, they are betrayed (by the ‘media’) as
        <em>unworthy of their government</em>,  and justly suffering for their
        sins. Carnal privilege blinds them to what they should joyfully give up.
        To not <em>believe</em> in government — as the radiant sign of the
        collective — is a  fallen state, from which the Obamanation extends a
        promise of redemption. By losing everything, with the help of
        government, one enters into the Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Obamanation is not what Obama has done (an intrinsically ridiculous
        construction). It’s what <em>chose Obama</em>, as its symbol. It is the
        virtual evacuation of the world into America, and the complementary
        evacuation of specifically American power from the world. This is the
        phase of historical progression in which neoreaction
        <em>necessarily</em> emerges, its diagnoses dramatized by everything
        that now occurs, undisguised.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that we are truly grateful, intrinsically, which is to say, in our
        very existence as the channel for something else. Conservatives will
        continue to find that hard to understand.

        The ‘Bush’ angle sounds partisan, and thus embarrassingly knuckle-draggy
        to brandy-sipping sophisticates of the Outer right, but that judgment
        might be over-hasty. Perhaps partisanship itself is swallowed up into
        the lampoon. In any case, it still makes me laugh, due mostly to the
        tacit understanding that “World War III” is what Obama <em>is for</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course</em>, when you elect the pure totem of the Cathedral to
        the world’s highest office, you’re really — or consequentially — calling
        for the cleansing of the earth in the fires of hell. It requires only
        the most elementary comprehension of Occidental religious history to
        understand that.

      <p>
        <em>Spiritual purity, and damn the consequences</em>, that’s the
        Obamanation (and, by the way, you’re a racist). It’s the bloody
        ruination of world order in the name of moral fanaticism, eclipsing all
        strategic realism through its wishful thinking and associated, narrow
        political maneuvers, before blundering into the present stage of
        terminal, incendiary, paralysis.

        the message that democracy is cooked. While careful to code the most
        sensitive perceptions, it givers every indication of recognizing that
        democracy can’t be transplanted beyond a dying ethnic core, that it
        relentlessly collapses time-horizons, and that it systematically selects
        for demagogic leaders (among numerous other problems). The Chinese
        model, despite its manifold imperfections, works far better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        No worries though — <em>The Economist</em> has some solutions. All
        democracies have to do is practice government self-restraint, reverse
        the growth of the state, and suppress majoritarianism, and everything
        will turn around for them. In other words, if democracy could just stop
        being democracy, it would have a future. (It can’t, and it doesn’t.)

        When democratic societies were far less deeply degenerate, they
        degenerated. Now they’ve become social wastelands of super-entitled
        dependency, led by professional pop-star liars, the idea that they have

        Considered solely in its basic cybernetic function, as a bi-polar
        homeostat, the power of American democracy is extraordinary. Binary
        oscillation is what it needs to work, so that is what it produces,
        absorbing all variation into its structured contest. Animal totems
        almost insultingly attest to the mobilization of archaic tribal
        instinct, and to the implicit meaninglessness of the one difference it
        permits. There is nothing, it
        <a href="https://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2015/12/3/san-bernardino-straight">seems</a>, that can escape
        it:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps it is fair to say that it is now impossible to commit a
          simple murder or even an outrage as an individual act. It’s all imbued
          with meaning, almost as if the conflict between the cops and the perps
          were overshadowed by a far larger fight: Right versus Left in
          America.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s an unmistakable
        <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/polarization/">trend</a> to
        intensification (more
        <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/">here</a>). Does that strengthen the
        mechanism, or steer it into crisis?
      </p>
      <p>
        A social <em>controlled fission</em> device of this scale and complexity
        is unprecedented in history. It began as an experiment, and is still
        undergoing dynamic evolution. How stable is the stabilizer? It’s

      <h4 class="post-title">King Mob</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        There’s quite definitely a technical problem with banning public street
        protest (i.e. mobs). Even a riotous mob is a vague concept, reliant upon
        discretionary police judgment on occasions. But is the criminalization
        of public protest also a problem of principal?
      </p>
      <p>
        Strangely, most libertarians seem to think the right to free-association
        extends automatically to mob formation. This presupposes that a mob is
        not inherently an act of aggression, existing solely to intimidate, and
        in fact — strictly speaking — an instance of terrorism. It is obvious
        why the Left should like the mob. It self-identifies as the articulate
        representative of the mob. Far more obscure is why anyone from a liberal
        tradition, let alone further to the right, should concur in this
        appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free expression hardly requires physical aggregation in public places,
        with near-inevitable expression of a potential for violence. It is not
        difficult to see that the basic historical role of the mob has been to
        advance demands, backed by implicit threat. Between a mob, a riotous
        mob, and a revolutionary mob, there are differences of degree rather
        than of kind. Even the strongest supporter of the principle of ‘voice’
        should see zero additional value in its physical concentration.
        Resonance and group emotion undermine a statement, rather than
        reinforcing it, unless the ‘statement’ is collectively directed anger
        (which is to say once again, inherently Leftist).
      </p>
      <p>
        Mobs are no doubt almost impossible to effectively criminalize. That
        does not at all mean one is compelled to like them, or acknowledge their
        legitimacy. Their existence is an intrinsic threat to both liberty
        <em>and</em> authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps laws against public indecency could be applied to politics in
        the street? In any case, it is past time for everyone to the right of
        the Left to lucidly despise it.

        This blog has zero confidence in ethno-nationalist street-fighting to
        achieve anything beyond an even more deeply vulgarized demotism, as
        inchoate mob impulses erupt under demagogic direction. So we consider
        the ‘<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24442953">decision</a>‘ by Tommy Robinson to step back
        from
        the hooligan counter-barbarism of
        the EDL to be a defeat only for those who misguidedly think
        crypto-fascist politics might have the key to the out-house, along with
        those who find a crypto-fascist enemy convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Politics in the streets is the primary indication of de-civilization in
        the modern age, and nothing could ever make it worthy of ultra-right
        support. Since street politics can occur only under government sanction
        — which is to say in the absence of grape-shot — any claim it might make
        to oppositional authenticity is wholly bogus. A right-wing riot is an
        absurdity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story here has a genuinely important angle, however. Robinson’s
        conversion to “better, democratic ideas” followed upon a
        carefully-crafted diplomatic
        <a
          href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03ghfyp/Quitting_the_English_Defence_League_When_Tommy_Met_Mo/">exercise</a>
        by Britain’s state broadcaster, which
        <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24706419">arranged</a> for him
        to meet with Muslim ‘representatives’ — under the supervision of the
        Quilliam Foundation — in order to learn how nice and reasonable they
        are.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> seems to have
        acknowledged its responsibility as the country’s effective government to
        directly settle the few remaining awkward ideological misalignments
        among the people. Neoreactionaries have learned that any democratic
        regime is really governed by its least democratic elements, and the more
        fanatical its democratization, the less democracy has to do with its
        rule. As with any Popular Protectorate under advanced democratic
        conditions, therefore, elections for the governing BBC Trust are not
        under consideration — because democracy is too important to throw like
        chum amongst the people (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Patten">except</a>
        of course in Hong Kong).

        I was slapped around a lot on Twitter recently by the usual Alt-Right
        mob for expressing the inflexible opinion that right-wing rioting — and
        political violence in general — is strategically retarded. So I have to
        assume now, out of attributed consistency, that my sparring partners at
        that juncture are considerably less amused than I am about the prospect
        of left-wing rioting. Rioting <em>for democracy</em> is, of course,
        better still. Eventually, violent social disorder and democracy begin to
        look like the same phenomenon, differentiated only by speed (or
        ‘spontaneity’). Then our grim work is done.

        The Outer Right provides the formal critique of democracy. It will be
        the Left, though, that graphically closes the curtain on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The defense of democracy in political theory is that it offers an
        alternative to violence as a mechanism for regime change. How’s that

          The combination of high initial growth and democratic transition seems
          to make some deceleration all but inevitable. The magnitude of the
          decelerations was very large: The median deceleration across the 22
          countries was 2.99 percent and the average deceleration was 3.53
          percent.</em>

        An <em>Outside in</em> stab at (tech-comm) NRx in a nutshell:

        <em>Europeans liked their welfare state regardless of where they stood on
          the political spectrum. The roots of “social democracy” lie on the
          left, but by the 1980s the preference for a mixed economy, generous
          health and pension benefits, and regulated markets had become, on the
          European continent at least, what Antonio Gramsci called a “hegemonic
          ideology.” These preferences were embraced by parties of the
          center-right as well as the center-left, compatible with capital yet
          acceptable to democratic majorities, and rejected principally by the
          extremes — and British Tories [sic]. The idea that this well-liked
          welfare state, deemed by many to be indispensable to social peace,
          might soon prove unviable in the globalized economy of the late
          twentieth century hence became a source of great anxiety.</em>

      <h2><em>Which lucky guy gets to take the blame?</em></h2>
      <p>
        Here in Shanghai, we receive the US presidential election results on
        Wednesday morning, making this the last chance to venture reckless
        predictions. Who gets to seize the poisoned chalice and assume
        responsibility for the

        of the United States of America?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Feel the hate</em>. Negativity reigns supreme in this election, with
        oppositional or defensive motivations almost wholly purified of positive
        contamination. According to The Economist, negative political ads have
        accounted for an unprecedented 90% of the total. The
        <a href="http://pjmedia.com/blog/instavision-is-atlas-shrugging/#comment-3549502" target="_blank">words</a>
        of PJ Media commenter Subotai Bahadur distill the sentiment perfectly:
        “Romney was not my first, second, or third choice, but I will crawl over
        ground glass to vote for him.” To be fondly remembered as ‘<a

        <em>Way of the Salamander</em>. Urban Future isn’t inclined to deride
        Mormonism as weird (being weird is what religions are for), but there
        are bound to be significant cultural implications to the inauguration of
        a Mormon president in an unusually
        <a href="http://2012apocalypse.net/" target="_blank">apocalyptic</a>
        time. The Mormon faith is the science fiction version of Abrahamic
        religion extending an evolutionary bridge from man to God – a path of
        practical divinization. No surprise, then, to discover that there’s a
        <a href="http://transfigurism.org/" target="_blank">Mormon Transhumanist Association</a>. When combined with
        the
        irreverence that latches onto any decaying,
        chaos-wracked administration it could get seriously entertaining …but
        then we’d miss the classic version of

        flavor
        of
        ground glass carefully.

        on to the apocalyptic theme. He argues that – at the brink of the
        ‘Fourth Turning’ – Mitt Romney’s age, which places him in the ‘prophet
        generation’, makes him odds on favorite to lead the global superpower
        into Armageddon (so we have that to look forward to).
      </p>
      <p>Reckless predictions?</p>
      <p>
        (1) Discounting systematic media dishonesty points to a substantial
        Romney victory.

        Partisan political stuff is as tacky as you can get, and if anything
        could get people chucked out of NRx (and into the garbage-compressor of
        history), that should be it. Having said that, and — of course — in a
        spirit of the loftiest imaginable detachment, here’s just the slightest
        morsel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://spectator.org/blog/24141/sailer-strategy">Sailer</a>
        <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-sailer-strategy-updated-three-steps-to-save-america">Strategy</a>
        is a model of sorts. This is due less to its concrete recommendations
        (fascinating even to those who
        <a href="http://whiskeysplace.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/why-the-sailer-strategy-doesnt-work/">disagree</a>
        with it, perhaps
        <a
          href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/white-nationalist-group-upset-it-s-not-getting-credit-inventing-gop-whites-only-strategy">vehemently</a>),
        than —<br />
        (a) Its configuration of the political chess board as a puzzle, posing
        the question:
        <em>Given this set up, is there any way for the GOP to win?</em> Playing
        GOP is much more fun, because it’s actually a challenge. Sailer doesn’t
        need this encouragement, because he’s clearly a small-d democrat, and
        probably also a big-R Republican, in sympathy at least. Despite this,
        his disreputable
        <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2014/01/patton-oswalt-political-correctness-is.html">noticing</a>
        habit makes him radioactive, which brings us to —<br />
        (b) While a paragon of ingenuousness, Sailer is positioned by strategic
        necessity in a position of subterfuge. His ideas are discussed in
        fearful whispers, in shadowy corners of political think-tanks, and
        circulated only in heavy disguise. It would be quite impossible for a
        pursuit of the Sailer Strategy to be publicly admitted, short of a
        social and ideological catastrophe so profound that its recommendations
        would have already been rendered moot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Outsideness Strategy</strong> is
        anti-democratic, merely opportunistically Republican, and
        politically-unmentionable for even more essential reasons than those
        just now alluded to. It has the advantages of extreme practicality,
        comparative simplicity, and — most importantly —
        <em>definitiveness</em>. It is intrinsically irreversible. It cannot be
        part of any continuing political dialectic. Once it is executed, the GOP
        will have expended itself utterly in completion of its teleo-historical
        function and auto-dismantle, among the ashes of American Democracy®.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unspeakable core of the Sailer Strategy:
        <em>The GOP actually doesn’t need anything but the white electorate to
          win</em>, and [gasp!]
        <em>racial polarization could easily be conceived as an asset</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Outsideness Strategy analog: the almost incomprehensible idiocy of
        the democratic system and, more specifically, of the American electorate
        is a massively under-exploited resource. The subtitle of the strategy
        paper that really cannot ever be written reads:
        <em>Winning big and terminally on the
          <a
            href="http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/idiocracy-is-a-cruel-movie-and-you-should-be-ashamed-fo-1553344189">idiocratic</a>
          battlefield</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the place to rehearse the neoreactionary diagnosis of
        democracy as an engine of cognitive deterioration. The “appalling
        political

        to fix it. Let the liberals explain it to you:

          <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-10-political-participation-interest-and-knowledge/">40
            percent of the public</a>
          even knows which party controls which chamber of Congress, which makes
          the notion that the Republicans would face a backlash for a lack of
          success fantastical.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody expects these two to agree upon much, but they do agree upon one
        thing: ‘Blame the President’ is the key to the democratic game. The
        figure-head of executive power — crafted ever more blatantly to
        <em>Hollywood standards</em> with each fresh election — is the
        convergence point where sublime ignorance, mass resentment, media
        opportunity, and electoral agency intersect. Just recognizing the
        President largely exhausts the mental capacities of the electorate as
        far as political matters are concerned, with a little slack left over
        for First Lady reality TV, and then — possibly — knowing the name of the
        Veep. After that, its swirling cognitive chaos, fed by outrages from
        partisan bubble-worlds, TV sound-bites, salacious detail, and race porn.
        The thought processes of the median voter are <em>extremely</em> easy to
        model: <em>Things bad, blame President!</em> Nothing beyond that has any
        real relevance, except to nerds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outsideness Strategy <em>jiu jitsu</em> jumps straight out of this. The
        fundamental recommendation:
        <em>Shore up the symbolic radiance of the Presidency, and then avoid it
          like the plague</em>. Aim to win everything <em>except the Presidency</em>, until the whole
        machinery comes apart. In other words, a GOP pursuing the OS would
        (furtively) renounce presidential office for the remaining duration of
        American Democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would be in it for them? <em>Everything except the Presidency</em>.
        That’s almost everything already. Pursue the Strategy, incrementally gut
        the powers of the executive, and the proportion of political prizes
        lying outside the Whitehouse steadily grows. That’s where the interests
        of an intelligent (if still craven, gluttonous, massively corrupt, and
        in most other ways radically despicable) GOP lie. All the pork
        warehouses get shifted away from the glittering media-saturated
        magnificence of the Whitehouse, ever deeper into the shadows, enabling
        monstrous plundering on an unprecedented scale to take place completely
        beyond the horizon of concrete democratic comprehension. (Nobody said it
        was going to be pretty.) POTUS gets the blame, Nu-GOP gets the gravy,
        FedGov is delegitimated, power is salted away steadily into state
        houses, and the whole abomination hurtles towards national
        disintegration. There’s only <em>one thing</em> the GOP has to do, and
        that’s <em>to lose the presidential election every single time</em>.
        Manage that, and it wins pretty much everything else without even
        trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Outsideness Strategy had already been initiated, we certainly
        wouldn’t have been told about it. The 2016 GOP Presidential pick will
        tell us a lot.

        <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9565119/democrats-in-deep-trouble">this</a>
        analysis (from the Left) is highly relevant to the Outsideness
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/popcorn-activism/">Strategy</a>. One
        could even be forgiven for thinking it is already being pursued:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The presidency is extremely important, of course. But there are also
          thousands of critically important offices all the way down the ballot.
          And the vast majority — 70 percent of state legislatures, more than 60
          percent of governors, 55 percent of attorneys general and secretaries
          of state — are in Republicans hands. And, of course, Republicans
          control both chambers of Congress.</em>
      </p>
      <p>With the final paragraph comes the money quote:</p>
      <p>
        <em>But the much more significant question facing the [Democratic] party
          isn’t about the White House — it’s about all the other offices in the
          land. The problem is that control of the presidency seems to have
          blinded progressive activists to the possibility of even having an
          argument about what to do about all of them. That will change if and
          when the GOP seizes the White House, too, and Democrats bottom out.
          But the truly striking thing is how close to bottom the party is
          already and how blind it seems to be to that fact.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the GOP take the presidency, of course, they reset back to
        homeostatic bi-polar alternation, degenerative quasi-equilibrium, and
        democratic functionality — which is disaster. So for the GOP, the
        question is how to stay out of the White House (without seeming to want
        to), while incrementally subverting the central organs of national
        executive power. When the decay process reaches the stages where large
        burning chunks are falling off, it’s critical that there’s a Democrat in
        the Oval Office to explain on cable news how it isn’t ze fault.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yglesias seems to think the Republicans might do something with the
        presidency of right-wing significance, which is (of course) laughable on
        its face. The Union Executive exists to take the coming fall, and
        nothing else. With that kept firmly in mind, everything can go
        swimmingly.

        Mencius Moldbug did the conceptual spadework needed to ignite NRx as an
        Internet discussion, but it was Barack Obama who put the world to the
        torch under the banshee cry “Neoreaction!” OK, that wasn’t his exact
        word, but the basic point isn’t seriously controversial. By slapping an
        explicit Cathedral clownface onto a faculty-lounge leftist superpower
        policy suite, destined to pan-dimensional failure, he utterly bankrupted
        mainstream global progressivism. The smug incompetence was insufferable,
        and — crucially — so complacent that it let the academic-media inner
        workings show. Even the saddest tools could see the thing now, and while
        many still supported it ardently, it kind of
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-203/">disgusted</a> them.
        There was clearly
        <em>no point at all trying to compromise with these people</em>. “Those
        neoreactionary types don’t, maybe we should be listening to them?”
        (Plenty of toxicity comes out of that, but there’s no need to rake over

        Victor Davis Hanson is an irredeemable Neocon, but he understands this

        <a href="http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8848#more-8848">portrait</a>
        of Obama is almost excruciatingly persuasive. Core point: “Insidiously
        and inadvertently, Barack Obama is alienating the people and moving the
        country to the right. If he keeps it up, by 2017 it will be a
        reactionary nation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the dark heart of the piece (quoted at a length that risks IP
        violation):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The tiny number of prescient pundits who warned what the Obama years
          would entail were not the supposedly sober and judicious establishment
          voices, who in fact seemed to be caught up in the hope-and-change
          euphoria and missed entirely Obama’s petulance and pique: the Evan
          Thomases (“he’s sort of god”), or the David Brookses (“and I was
          looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m
          thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good
          president.” “It is easy to sketch out a scenario in which [Obama]
          could be a great president.”), or the Chris Matthewses (“the feeling
          most people get when they hear Barack Obama’s speech. My, I felt this
          thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don’t have that too often.”), or the
          Michael Beschlosses (“Uh. I would say it’s probably — he’s probably
          the smartest guy ever to become President.”), or the Chris Buckleys
          (“He has exhibited throughout a ‘first-class temperament,’ pace Oliver
          Wendell Holmes Jr.’s famous comment about FDR. As for his intellect,
          well, he’s a Harvard man”), or the Kathleen Parkers (“… with solemn
          prayers that Obama will govern as the centrist, pragmatic leader he is
          capable of being”), or the Peggy Noonans (“He has within him the
          possibility to change the direction and tone of American foreign
          policy, which need changing; his rise will serve as a practical rebuke
          to the past five years, which need rebuking; his victory would provide
          a fresh start in a nation in which a fresh start would come as a
          national relief.”).</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>In truth, it was the loud, sometimes shrill, and caricatured voices
          of talk radio, the so-called crazy Republican House members, and the
          grassroots loudmouths of what would become the Tea Party who had
          Obama’s number. They warned early on that Barack Obama’s record was
          that of a petulant extremist, that his writing presaged that he would
          borrow and spend like no other president, that his past associations
          gave warning that he would use his community-organizing skills
          cynically to divide Americans along racial lines, that nothing in his
          past had ever suggested anything other than radicalism and an ease
          with divisive speech, that his votes as a state legislator and as a
          U.S. senator suggested that he had an instinctual dislike of the
          entrepreneur and the self-made businessman, and that his past rhetoric
          advised that he would ignore settled law and instead would rule by
          fiat — that he would render immigration law null and void, that he
          would diminish the profile of America abroad, and that he would do all
          this because he was an ideologue, with no history of bipartisanship
          but a lot of animus toward his critics, and one who saw no ethical or
          practical reason to appreciate the more than 60 years of America’s
          postwar global leadership and the world that it had built. Again, the
          despised right-wingers were right and the more moderate establishment
          quite wrong.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who supported Obama are never going to be taken seriously about
        anything, ever again. They’re done. (That’s what Trump demonstrates.)
      </p>
      <p>But there’s more:</p>
      <p>
        <em>A lot of ambitious and dangerous powers are watching Obama assume a
          fetal position, and may well as a consequence act foolishly and
          recklessly this next year. Not only Russia, China, and North Korea,
          but also Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, ISIS, and assorted rogue states may
          take chances in the next 14 months that they would otherwise never
          have entertained (given that America is innately strong and they are
          mostly in comparison far weaker) — on the premise that such
          adventurism offers tangible advantages without likely negative
          consequences and that the chance for such opportunities will not
          present itself again for decades to come. […] At home, Obama feels
          liberated now that he is free from further elections. He thinks he has
          a legitimate right to be a bit vindictive and vent his own
          frustrations and pique, heretofore repressed over the last seven years
          because of the exigencies of Democratic electioneering. Obama can now
          vent and strike back at his opponents, caricaturing them from abroad,
          questioning their patriotism, slandering them for sport, and trying to
          figure out which emblematic executive orders and extra-legal
          bureaucratic directives will most infuriate them and repay them for
          their supposed culpability for his failed
          <strong>vero possumus</strong> presidency. […] The more contrarian he
          becomes, and the more he opposes the wishes of the vast majority of
          the American people, all the more Obama envisions himself speaking
          truth to power and becoming iconic of something rather than the
          reality that he is becoming proof of nothing. […] Hold on. We haven’t
          seen anything yet.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One more year of Obama’s — hopefully intensified — NRx activism, then
        things get a whole lot more difficult. Four years of remotely competent,
        and even vaguely rightish US executive government, and NRx as a memetic
        contagion will be close to extinction. That might not be a bad thing,
        but it’s worth noting.

        final — and probably irrecoverable — facts.

        The radical
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_United_States">repolarization</a>
        of the party system within an Anglophone democracy is a rare event. To
        find persuasive precedent for what is happening today, it is arguably
        necessary to return all the way to the mid-19th century and the
        emergence of the Republican Party during the Civil War era. It’s only
        natural, then, that their should be an unusual level of agitation about
        developments (though this description risks — very seriously — putting
        the cart before the horse).

          Senator Reid is prepared to invoke the so-called “nuclear option”
          and force through President Obama’s nominees on a party-line vote,
          perhaps as early as today. What this involves is making a
          parliamentary ruling that only a majority vote is required to end
          debate on a judicial nomination and then sustaining that decision with
          a majority vote. Some Senate Republicans threatened to take such a
          step during the Bush Administration, but backed off when a group of
          Senators from both parties forged a temporary deal to end the
          stand-off and avert the rule change.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ‘nuclear option’ represents the clear admission that the division of
        powers is not only dead but spectacularly cremated, with judicial
        appointees formally reduced to partisan functionaries. It would thus
        signal the explicit demolition of the US Constitution. Since a wheezing
        travesty is worse than a corpse, even strong supporters of the
        constitutional principle should have few problems with this specific
        instance of incendiary termination.

          Together, words and numbers mold a country’s politics. In this
          process, the constitution is the constant while election represent a
          dynamic element. In the near future, this could also present a problem
          in several places: Election results are expected to deliver the wrong
          numbers. In Austria, a right-wing populist might get elected
          president. This could also happen in the United States. Germany’s AfD

        The idea that political seriousness can be evacuated from any situation
        by invoking (purely procedural) ‘democratic’ norms was always an
        evasion. It was a way to avoid the reality of ‘who-whom’, and thus
        dependent upon a haze of Cathedralist insincerity. The implicit selling
        point — “Don’t worry, the rabble will accept representatives that we can
        work with” — isn’t bought by anybody anymore. Things have gone wrong
        badly enough, often enough, for such promises to have been discounted
        down to zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t want the rabble in power, you have to keep them from power.
        That’s the simple, and now overt, understanding of the dawning
        post-demotic age. Michael Hirsh doesn’t like it at all:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As the Egyptian military consolidates control by murdering pro-Muslim
          Brotherhood protesters and declaring a state of emergency, we may be
          witnessing the most dangerous potential for Arab radicalization since
          the two Palestinian intifadas. Despite the resignation Wednesday of
          Mohamed ElBaradei, the vice president, in opposition to the Egyptian
          junta’s action, the discomfiting fact is that most of Egypt’s liberal
          “democrats”—along with the United States—have never looked more
          hypocritical. If the bloody crackdown is allowed to continue while the
          U.S. and West do nothing, the actions of the Egyptian military could
          de-legitimize democratic change in the Arab world for a generation or
          more.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Read <em>without judgement</em>, Hirsh’s article is a fascinating
        document, punctuated by a raging despair that marks a transition of
        aeons. “Egypt’s liberal ‘democrats'” can either change course in
        accordance with their name (as Hirsh would like, but does not expect),
        or they can teach the world that ‘liberal democrats’ know nothing of
        global political reality, and need to call themselves something new. A
        sound name would describe a plausible, though ambitious, aspiration:
        <strong>Modernity in Power</strong> (freed of democratic dreams). It
        will still be a while before we hear anything of this kind, but its
        intimations are not — any longer — difficult to detect.

        NRx tends to be quite insular, often out of semi-articulate principle,
        so nobody (other than enemies) seems to have paid much attention to this
        yet. That’s odd, upon reflection, because the Modi BJP seems to be
        juggling
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomy/">Trichotomy</a> issues
        of a familiar kind within its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva">Hindutva</a> platform,
        which glues together a quasi-stable raft of religious,
        ethno-nationalist, and capitalistic elements into an explicitly
        reactionary-modernizing coalition. When the 21st century is allotted to
        Asia, it’s for a reason. The West’s vague premonitions are urgent
        practicalities there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should NRx be waving the Modi banner with
        enthusiasm? There are some obvious reasons for caution (beside dim
        parochialism). Most centrally, the role of democracy in the BJP wave is
        strongly analogous to that afflicting the 20th century European far
        right, and the record of reactionary demotism scores a straight ‘<a

        Democratic pressures suck the right into an ideological black-hole,
        since the only parts of its agenda that hit the tingle-spot with the
        masses are its crudest appeals to atavistic sentiment. Cognitive
        regression is the inevitable price of popularity.

        It follows, then, that Indian developments are more likely to provide
        another lesson in political tragedy than a torch of inspiration. Unless
        an incoming Modi regime moves quickly to begin dismantling the structure
        of Indian democracy (sadly, an unimaginable prospect), its modernizing
        competence will eventually fall prey to mob impulses, as the people —
        once again — get the government they deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        For NRx, I suspect, the essential lesson will be a deepened
        understanding of the toxicity of populism, even if it seems —
        momentarily — to be flowing in the right direction. Still, dogmatism has
        no respectable place in such matters. If something more positive, and
        complex, comes out of this, <em>Outside in</em> will be among the first
        to applaud it.

        Congress, one of the most despicable political organizations on earth,
        has been crushed like a bug. The implications of that are roughly
        comparable to the detonation of a dirty nuke at Davos, so a modest
        period of celebration would be wholly understandable. Unfortunately,
        while Modi’s historic victory is a massive global lurch to reaction, it
        is also a surreptitious triumph of democracy, and we’ve seen the way
        this plays out before.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Thatcher / Reagan experience in the
        West, there are lessons about the democratic limitation of general
        application to the Right. The first, already briefly touched upon in the
        previous Modi post, is that democracy demands populism. Since
        capitalistic deregulation triggers a demagogic counter-attack from the
        Left, it is inevitably supported — politically — by a platform of
        ‘social conservatism’ that is driven into ever cruder atavism, until it
        cannibalizes the policy agenda of the government. The more a regime
        seeks, under democratic conditions, to move the economy rightwards, the
        more it is politically compelled to appeal to tribal emotion, while
        diverting its energies into totemism. Eventually, all that remains is a
        culture war, in which a confused Right is reduced to the pre-defeated
        posture of seeking to slow change down. When the pendulum swings — as
        democracy ensures it will — it exposes the archetypal political truth: a
        fast-left party then replaces a slow-left party, with the eventually
        victory of ‘progress’ never having been seriously in doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any democratic ‘right-wing’ party in power has won an election, and is
        thus infused with a sense of  its popular virility. This is a
        psychological catastrophe — and in fact a latent psychosis — from which
        it never recovers. The ratchet, patiently, continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Democratic politics also corrodes right-wing economic policy even more
        directly. The lesson from Reaganism is especially stark. From the
        beginning, political competence is expressed by a single dominant
        insight: any gains made by a right-wing administration in the direction
        of fiscal responsibility is simply a savings account for the opposition.
        It can be predicated, with absolute confidence, that each step painfully
        taken away from public insolvency will be reversed, with opposite
        political sign, as soon as the Left gets its turn once again. Thus, the
        Reaganite stance that any intelligent conservative government is bound
        to the proclamation ‘deficits don’t matter’. It is only by keeping
        public finances hard up against the edge of bankruptcy that fiscal
        laxity can be prevented from reverting to its natural state, as a fund
        available for the promotion of leftward social acceleration. Private
        saving is profoundly compromised by democratic governance. Public saving
        — or even moderated indebtedness — is simply impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no way at all that Modi can restore Indian fiscal health under
        the democratic conditions he inherits (and which he will certainly
        preserve). The idea that he might attempt to do so is a delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, there are things a Modi regime could do, which are worth
        doing. In rough order of priority and practicality they include:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) A holocaust of red-tape, in the interest of industrialization. The
        Indian manufacturing sector, employing approximately 15% of
        the workforce, is half the size that might be expected if business
        conditions were less impaired by legal-bureaucratic obstruction. Huge
        economic gains could be made relatively quickly if companies could be
        created more easily and closed down without any need for official
        permission, while hiring and firing employees according to market
        signals. Modi knows enough to see what is required. First ask the
        Marxists to describe their most nightmarish conception of an
        exploitative capitalist labor-market, and then do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) While fiscal continence is politically impossible,  it should at
        least be possible to re-orient public spending towards infrastructure
        (and away from transfer payments). Copying China would be sensible.
        High-speed rail networks, urban mass-transit systems, roads, power
        grids, water and sewerage, high-bandwidth communications, space-programs
        … since vast amounts of public money have to be wasted, those are the
        ways to do it. They accumulate capital, create business opportunities
        and employment, teach technical skills, and leave something real behind
        when the bubbles pop.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Scrap as many affirmative action quotas as possible. This is an
        opportunity to do cynical culture wars stuff that actually does some
        good.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Prepare for the return of the Left, by decentralizing government,
        empowering the states, reducing inter-regional economic transfers,
        innovating constitutional obstacles to socialist policy, and building
        right-wing economic redoubts capable of resisting a future Leftist
        central administration. This is all very obvious, but it’s equally
        obvious why even seriously conservative central governments find it
        difficult to do. It would help if they more clearly understood that
        they’re going to lose — that’s what democracy means — so they should
        seize the opportunity to get their revenge in first.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRx shouldn’t make a fool of itself by getting excited about Modi.
        What’s happening in India isn’t nothing, though. It’s nowhere close to
        being nothing.

            Tankersley</a>, writing in the Washington Post elaborates on the same theme. … The
          new narrative is that America is in crisis. “Unexpectedly,” one might
          add. … Which direction you go will depend on your party. The Democrats
          will argue for more carbon controls, more immigration, Single Payer,
          more deals with foreign dictators, etc. The Republicans will argue for
          more GOP Senators and Congressmen to be elected to Capitol Hill —
          after which they will vote for more carbon controls, more immigration,
          Single Payer, more deals with foreign dictators, etc. … We have it on
          good liberal authority that there’s a copious amount [of] tinder and
          straw scattered all over the floor. If one day a spark should start a
          fire, it won’t be due as much to the intensity of the spark as the
          abundance of fuel. … Perhaps the most most potent forces for change
          are disruptive technologies that undermine established elites. A
          “revolt against the ruling class” still concedes their capacity to
          rule; it is the destruction of their basis to rule by innovation that

          game in town? In our view, the degree to which a democracy is
          consolidated depends on three key characteristics: the degree of
          popular support for democracy as a system of government; the degree to
          which antisystem parties and movements are weak or nonexistent; and
          the degree to which the democratic rules are accepted. […] This
          empirical understanding of democratic consolidation opens up
          conceptual space for the possibility of “democratic deconsolidation.”
          In theory, it is possible that, even in the seemingly consolidated
          democracies of North America and Western Europe, democracy may one day
          cease to be the “only game in town”: Citizens who once accepted
          democracy as the only legitimate form of government could become more
          open to authoritarian alternatives. […] … It is at least plausible to
          think that such a process of democratic deconsolidation may already be
          underway in a number of established democracies in North America and
          Western Europe. […] … In a world where most citizens fervently support
          democracy, where antisystem parties are marginal or nonexistent, and
          where major political forces respect the rules of the political game,
          democratic breakdown is extremely unlikely. It is no longer certain,
          however, that this is the world we live in. […] … As democracies
          deconsolidate, the prospect of democratic breakdown becomes
          increasingly likely — even in parts of the world that have long been
          spared such instability. If political scientists are to avoid being
          blindsided by the demise of established democracies in the coming
          decades, as they were by the fall of communism a few decades ago, they
          need to find out whether democratic deconsolidation is happening; to
          explain the possible causes of this development; to delineate its
          likely consequences (present and future); and to ponder the potential
          remedies.</em>

        Why do some (awkward) libertarians sympathize with the Confederacy?
        <a href="http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/19/why-some-libertarians-sympathize-with-the-confederacy/">Asks</a>
        David Bernstein at <em>The Volokh Conspiracy</em>. This is probably as
        reasonable as mainstream libertarianism is ever going to get on the lost
        cause, but it still manages to muddy an intrinsically pellucid point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even those libertarians who do adopt a Rothbardian/Chomskyite view of
          foreign policy, or who for any other reason beyond racism wish the
          Union would have let the Confederacy secede peacefully, are making a
          mistake in defending the Confederacy–the enemy of one’s enemy isn’t
          necessarily a friend. But I just wanted to point out that I think a
          significant amount of libertarian sympathy for the Confederacy in the
          circles where it exists is really a product of intense distaste for
          the U.S. government and its post-Civil War record [along with, as a
          commenter notes, a general sympathy for the right of secession] rather
          than a considered view of the Confederacy’s own record.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting aside the Chomsky distraction, there’s an almost painful
        struggle to be fair going on here — but then the brackets ruin
        everything. Secession is the key, irrespective of the course taken by
        the Union,
        <em>because the Union itself only exists due to a successful war of
          secession</em>. If the USA was legitimately born out of war of independence, then it
        was illegitimately perpetuated by the suppression of the subsequent war
        of independence which would have divided it. Placing the onus on
        libertarian confederates to explain themselves — or to have an
        explanation advanced on their behalf — gets the order of logical
        obligation completely upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the Articles of Confederation preceded the American
        Constitution. Confederation was  not impudently demanded in the mid-19th
        century, but stripped away by an emergent central power in the late-18th
        century. In combination, these assaults on decentralized government have
        rendered American political history almost entirely opaque to itself.
        <em>Confederation is the primordial expression of American
          independence</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, from a practical point of view, none of this really matters,
        because America’s racial nightmare drowns everything out, binding dreams
        of redemption so intimately to concentrated power that freedom is
        reduced to ever-more-marginalized <em>crimethink</em>. Under these
        circumstances, the pretense of reason seems merely absurd.

        death in the reactosphere have been greatly exaggerated, but elsewhere —
        not so much. For sheer weirdness, it’s hard to beat the

        <em>The Oil Drum</em>‘s closure at <em>The Daily Bell</em> — an event of

        assured — and one almost immediately followed by the closure of …

        By simple analogy, can we assume this death is also overflowing with

        I’m guessing my vague melancholy on the subject won’t find many echoes
        out here on the right fringe. “Another bunch of nutty libertarians go
        over the cliff, big deal” might not be a bad guess at the average
        response, if it didn’t so clearly underestimate the prevailing
        indifference (I don’t recall anybody else linking to them on anything).
        They were strong advocates of the “Internet Reformation”, ushering in a
        new epoch of liberty worldwide, as the scheming “global elite” were
        forced to take a “step back”, their “directed history” undone by
        electronic “truth-telling”.

        As part of the ongoing celebrations of Prophecy Month at
        <em>Outside in</em>, we present a (short) three part series by Lars
        Seier Christensen of Saxo Bank on the historical prescience of Ayn Rand
        (<a
          href="http://www.tradingfloor.com/posts/full-blown-capitalism-shrugged-socialist-hybrids-1687446122">one</a>,

        <a href="http://www.tradingfloor.com/posts/broader-relevance-ayn-rand-society-710110757">three</a>). While
        some
        distance from high theory, even the most Rand-averse
        should be able to take something interesting away from this series,
        whether by considering it as a significant ethnographic — and even
        religious — phenomenon, or by appraising it as a structured forecast.
        The foundations (laid in part one) certainly seem realistic enough: “…
        free capitalism has not really been experienced by many people alive
        today. […] The strange hybrid of western societies … allows only limited
        capitalism to create enough wealth to support a wider range of political
        and social ambitions, largely controlled by anti-capitalists.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Christensen asks:
        <em>does the world look increasingly like the politically saturated,
          anti-capitalist stagnatopia she envisaged?</em>
        If the evaluation of Rand is restricted to these terms, her claim to
        attention seems assured.  The conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If we don’t succeed in changing the values and direction of at least
          the next generation, I fear the full prediction of Atlas Shrugged will
          become reality and while that may hold some promise for the distant
          future, it is not something that I think people of my age feel like
          going through if we can avoid it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the Cathedral — which is to say, pedagogical (and propagandistic)
        anti-capitalism in power — Christensen’s hope for a generational shift
        in “values and direction” sounds like a prayer to a dead God. That
        leaves only Cassandra, and tragic truths.

        Of all the reasons to read Kant, the most important is to understand
        Mises, and thus the template for a functional world (however
        unobtainable). Austrian economics, as formulated in
        <em>Human Action</em>, consists exclusively of systematically assembled
        <em>synthetic a priori</em> propositions. Insofar as action is in fact
        directed by practical reason, the conclusions of organized praxeology
        <em>cannot be wrong</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is pointless to ask an Austrian Economist whether he ‘believes’ a
        rise in the minimum wage will increase unemployment (above the level it
        would otherwise be). The praxeological construction of economic law is
        indifferent to empirical regularity, as to anything less certain than
        rational necessity. Does one ‘believe’ that 2 + 2 = 4? No, one
        <em>knows</em> it, because the irreducible values of the signs compel
        the conclusion, and are inextricable from it. There could be no value
        ‘2’ unless its doubling equaled ‘4’, or any meaning to ‘wage’ unless its
        doubling reduced demand for labor. Empirically
        <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/issues/september-2012/theory-practice-austrian-school">sensitive</a>
        Austrianism isn’t Austrian at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like game theory, Austrianism applies
        wherever rational agents seek to maximize advantage. Perhaps, as Moldbug
        <a
          href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.ca/2010/02/from-mises-to-carlyle-my-sick-journey.html">argues</a>,
        it is comparable to Euclidean geometry — another
        <em>synthetic a priori</em> construction — embedded, as a special case,
        within a more general model, unconstrained by the presupposition of
        intelligible purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The problem with Mises as guru is that Misesian classical liberalism
          (or Rothbardian libertarianism) is like Newtonian physics. It is
          basically correct within its operating envelope. Under unusual
          conditions it breaks down, and a more general model is needed. The
          equation has another term, the ordinary value of which is zero.
          Without this term, the equation is wrong. Normally this is no problem;
          but if the term is <strong>not zero</strong>, the error becomes
          visible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a matter of historical fact, this is how the neoreactionary departure
        from pure libertarianism has occurred. It has stumbled upon non-zero
        curvature in the domain of political economy, and — unable to comfort
        itself through the dismissal of this discovery — it has precipitated an
        intellectual crisis, through which it spreads. Whether faithfully
        Carlylean, or not, it insists upon a generalization of realism beyond
        expectations of liberal order. Civilization is the fragile solution to a
        deeper problem, not a stable foundation to be assumed — as a parallel
        postulate — by subsequent, elaborate calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this make of money? Can Austrianism be modified, by systematic
        transformations, that adapt it to the dark intrusion of neoreactionary
        realism? That is a question

          learn of an instance when the deliberate vote of the majority (<strong>as distinguished from the decision of

        Cato-hosted essay by Peter Thiel, in which he states: “I no longer

        article by Juan Carlos Hidalgo (from the Cato Institute’s Center for
        Global Liberty and Prosperity). Headlined ‘How socialism has destroyed
        Venezuela’ it tracks the descent of what “was once South America’s
        richest country” into a hellish, crime-wracked, economic ruin. Socialist
        insanity is, of course, the immediate cause. How, though, did socialism
        become Venezuelan public policy? This is a question Hidalgo seems unable
        to imagine, let alone answer.

        The account, as far as it goes, is
        unexceptionable:

        <em>Driving the unrest is a large segment of the population that is fed
          up with the country’s rapidly deteriorating economy. Despite receiving
          over $1 trillion in oil revenues since 1999, the government has run
          out of cash and now relies heavily on printing money to finance
          itself. The result is the highest inflation rate in the world:
          officially 56 per cent last year, although according to calculations
          by Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University, the implied annual
          inflation rate is actually 330 per cent.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The government reacted to skyrocketing inflation by following the
          typical socialist script: it imposed draconian price controls and has
          been raiding businesses it accuses of hoarding. As a result, there are
          widespread shortages of food and medicines, and people have to endure
          hour-long lines in supermarkets. The scarcity index produced by
          Venezuela’s central bank reached 28 per cent in January, meaning that
          one out of four basic products is out of stock at any given time.
          Somehow, toilet paper is now more valuable than paper money.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The productive sector has been decimated after hundreds of
          nationalisations and expropriations. Oil now accounts for 96 per cent
          of export earnings, up from 80 per cent a decade ago. Moreover, due to
          gross mismanagement at PDVSA, the state oil monopoly, production has
          dropped by 28 per cent since 2000, the only major energy producer in
          the world to experience a decline in the last quarter of a
          century.</em>
      </p>

        <em>The economic hardship faced by Venezuelans is compounded by a
          horrific rise in crime. The country is now one of the most dangerous
          places in the world, with almost 25,000 homicides in 2013 – a murder
          rate of 79 killings per 100,000 inhabitants. One of the reasons the
          protests are growing, despite the government’s brutal repression, is
          that the country is quickly becoming unlivable and many Venezuelans
          think that they have nothing to lose.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We get it (really); socialism is the path to chaotic ruin. And the path
        to socialism? Here Hidalgo switches without the slightest hint of
        reflective awareness from perceptive acuity to self-subverting cognitive
        confusion:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For many years [Venezuela] was also a remarkable democracy in a
          region where most nations were ruled by military dictatorships. Today,
          socialism has turned Venezuela into an authoritarian basket case that
          thousands try to escape every year. With millions of Venezuelans no
          longer willing to put up with deteriorating living conditions, and a
          government willing to take whatever means necessary to hold on to
          power, it looks like the worst is yet to come.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So over the course of “many years” democratic Venezuela transformed into
        a socialist catastrophe. Are the Cato story tellers going to suggest a
        narrative for this, or are they going to let us do it for them?

        It’s probably less true with each passing week that Neoreaction can be
        accurately described as a small, dispersed population of
        <em>libertarians mugged by reality</em>. Nevertheless, it is part of NRx
        heritage that such a characterization made considerable sense in the
        past. There should be no surprise that between libertarianism and NRx a
        significant zone of complex friction and interchange can be found. Right
        now, <em><a href="http://theumlaut.com/">Umlaut</a></em> is the media
        motor of such contact.

        This is more than a little strange. Partly, it is odd because
        <em>Umlaut</em>‘s CATO institute parent is the principle representative
        of respectable libertarianism, feeding ideas into the political process
        (where they are of course completely ignored), while stressing a
        non-threatening strain of Statist harm reduction, rather than the
        rougher anti-state antagonism of the
        <a href="http://mises.org/">Mises Institute</a>, or even the dope-head
        dissidence of <em><a href="http://reason.com/">Reason</a></em>. Secondly, it seems an unlikely follow up to

        This development grates on a number of neuralgic NRx issues, which makes
        it enormously entertaining, intellectually stimulating, and
        strategically tangled. It plugs directly into the recent ‘entryism’
        conversation, due to the libertarian connections of Patri Friedman (a
        focus of the J. Arthur Bloom piece.) Themes of exit, secession, and
        markets, among others, are all susceptible to inflammation from
        libertarian influences. Working out what NRx is, at its core, is
        inevitably complicated by ideological foreign entanglements, especially
        if the libertarian connection is mirrored — at the other extreme — by a
        no less tortuous negotiation over boundaries with the European New
        Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        To underscore the latter point, NRx is reasonably analogized to a weak,
        fissile state, cross-cut by the machinations of superpowers
        (libertarianism and the ENR). Local ‘nationalists’ deploring all alien
        interference quickly find their positions undermined by the blatant
        dissymmetry of their concerns, driving them into polarization, conflict,
        collaboration, and counter-collaboration.

        Mark Lutter
        <a href="http://calculusofdissent.com/2014/11/11/culture-and-space-colonization/">advances</a>
        the following thought experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Earth is dying, unable to further sustain human life. Mankind has
          thrown their last resources into creating a space ship that can reach
          a habitable planet. However, the space ship can only carry 10,000
          people and little is known about the planet beyond gravity and oxygen
          levels. With the literal fate of humanity lying before us, who do we
          send and why?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, it gets
        <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/Weird_People_BBS_Henrichetal.pdf">WEIRD</a>
        (<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/epiphenom/2009/09/how-normal-is-weird.html">+</a>
        <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/17x/beware_of_weird_psychological_samples/">++</a>). In a nutshell, Lutter’s
        ‘we’, while — apparently in absolute
        innocence — employed to represent the voice of humanity as a whole, is
        self-evidently processing the problem in a way that would make no sense
        beyond its own peculiar
        <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/thedes-and-phyles/">thede</a>. ‘We’ could probably all come
        to
        the reasonable conclusion that only
        the Swiss get to survive. (Right?)
      </p>
      <p>
        In passing, he notes that ‘we’ all agree multiculturalism is a
        dysfunctional mess: “For all the praise of multiculturalism, no one
        would seriously bet a diverse group of cultures would give the greatest
        chance for success. …” (The whole paragraph is a jaw-dropper.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The main point, however: “Picking a cultural group to colonize a new
        planet and save humanity forces the mind to focus on positive and
        negative attributes of the cultural group.” This perfectly exemplifies
        the <em>weirded out</em> intelligence of libertarians, expressed as a
        detached universalism wholly incognisant of its own deracination. The
        obvious rejoinder: <em>No one thinks like that</em> (except you guys).
        It might be over-compensation to suggest that two-thirds of the world’s
        population would respond to the total extermination of the Swiss with
        vague amusement, but it’s at least as plausible as Lutter’s assumption
        that the good people of Helvetia would be neutrally evaluated, selected,
        and then cheered on as the sole remnant of ‘humanity’, to such an extent
        that
        <em>not being Swiss would be cheerfully accepted as an ethnic death
          sentence</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t meant to be any kind of denuciation — it’s very possible
        Lutter is playing his (weird) audience hard, and doing something
        subversively dark around the back. As barb-hooked bait for libertarian
        nuttiness, his post is really something. I can’t wait to see what his
        comment thread looks like.

        anything I wrote was terribly controversial …” (At
        least one of us has to be psychotically dissociated — not that there’s
        anything wrong with that.)

        <em>All people are not equal. In fact, two individuals who are in every

          differences between them. When those people have evolved for thousands
          of years in radically different environments, those people will have
          even greater differences between them. Such differences will include
          but not be limited to intelligence, propensity for violence, and
          propensity for cooperation.</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          Any libertarian with the slightest bit of observational skills has to
          have noticed that we’re mostly a movement of white males. They would
          also notice that there is no libertarian movement to speak of outside
          of cultures descendant from Europeans. This is not a weakness of
          libertarianism, as our leftist infiltrators attempt to insist. It is
          rather a very obvious indicator that white males have a greater
          natural inclination toward market cooperation than other peoples. To
          insist otherwise is nothing more than the denial of human nature, it
          is biological and cultural Marxism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leftists know this, and since they hate freedom, they hate white
          males. They will thus do everything in their power to destroy us
          before we manage to make any headway in advancing our ideas. This
          includes mass subsidized immigration from third world countries.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>While our ideal society would have no government and thus no
          arbitrary geopolitical borders enforced by State mercenaries, the
          notion that there would be free and unrestricted travel the world over
          in the absence of the State is a remarkably ridiculous left wing idea.
          Borders are the whole point of freedom, as borders are demarcations of
          property rights.</em>

        It’s the beginning, rather than the end, of a discussion. (XS finds a
        few quibble points, and far more in the rest of the post.) For anybody
        wondering about current mutations on the Libertarian Right, however, the
        basic structure of insight on exhibition here is the place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Euro-descended (and specifically Anglo-Dutch descended) males are
        differentially inclined to libertarian attitudes, to a remarkable degree
        (statistically speaking). Disentangling race and culture in this regard
        is far from straightforward. The sex-based dispositional difference is
        far less noisy. (Of course, the Marxoid explanation is that
        doubly-privileged Whites Males are defending their social advantages
        through this ideological preference.) Also notable, IMHO, is the
        (almost?) equally marked tendency of European peoples towards extreme,
        highly-idealized and morally-fanatic leftism — compared to the
        conceptually-fuzzy tribal and communitarian sensibilities widespread
        elsewhere. Bleeding-heart Left-libertarianism is about as
        distilled-White as anything ever gets — but with that remark, I’m
        already straying into the quibble-zone.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At his best, Mr Thiel was a mixture of libertarian and contrarian. As
          a student at Stanford University in the late 1980s and early 1990s he
          railed against the new academic orthodoxies of multiculturalism and
          diversity and political correctness, founding a conservative magazine,
          <strong>Stanford Review</strong>, and publishing an
          establishment-baiting book, “The Diversity Myth”. He even defended a
          fellow law student, Keith Rabois, who decided to test the limits of
          free speech on campus by standing outside a teacher’s residence and
          shouting “Faggot! Faggot! Hope you die of AIDS!” When he was a young
          tyro in Silicon Valley, his libertarian vision inspired many of his
          business decisions. He hoped that PayPal would help create a new world
          currency, free from government control and dilution, and that Facebook
          would help people form spontaneous communities outside traditional
          nation states.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>There is a darker element in his thinking today. In an essay written
          in 2009 for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, he declared
          that he no longer believed that “freedom and democracy are
          compatible”, putting some of the blame for growing statism on the rise
          of welfare dependency and the enfranchisement of women. He added a
          grandiloquent coda: “The fate of our world may depend on the effort of
          a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that
          makes the world safe for capitalism”.</em>

        Libertarianism either goes dark, or it dies of cognitive dissonance. The

        ‘Liberaltarian’ isn’t a word that’s been heard much recently. Whilst
        aesthetics is surely part of the explanation, there’s probably more to
        it than that. Most obviously, recent political developments in the
        United States have shown, beyond the slightest possibility of doubt,
        that modern ‘liberalism’ and the project of maximal state expansion are
        so completely indistinguishable that liberal-libertarian fusionism can
        only perform a comedy act. Garin K Hovannisian had already

          libertarian concerns and insights could make possible a truly
          progressive politics once again—not progressive in the sense of hewing
          to a particular set of preexisting left-wing commitments, but rather
          in the sense of attuning itself to the objective dynamics of U.S.
          social development. In other words, a politics that joins together
          under one banner the causes of both cultural and economic
          progress.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Conservative fusionism, the defining ideology of the American right
          for a half-century, was premised on the idea that libertarian policies
          and traditional values are complementary goods. That idea still
          retains at least an intermittent plausibility—for example, in the case
          for school choice as providing a refuge for socially conservative
          families. But an honest survey of the past half-century shows a much
          better match between libertarian means and progressive ends. Most
          obviously, many of the great libertarian breakthroughs of the era—the
          fall of Jim Crow, the end of censorship, the legalization of abortion,
          the liberalization of divorce laws, the increased protection of the
          rights of the accused, the reopening of immigration—were championed by
          the political left.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Libertarian means and progressive ends. Could it imaginably be said more
        clearly? Liberty is legitimate if, and only if, it <em>serves</em> to
        promote the consolidation of the Cathedral (through chaotic
        multicultural criminality), which is then retrospectively interpreted as
        the intrinsic <em>telos</em> of freedom. Whatever does not subordinate
        itself to this agenda is to have its brains eaten, and be systematically
        recycled into progressive zombie flesh. This is a project for
        libertarian hipsters and Leviathan apparatchiks to undertake
        hand-in-hand — fusionally. The new age of the cannibal is come.

        <em>Neoreactionaries are libertarians mugged by reality</em> (to adapt a
        <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Irving_Kristol">pre-coined</a>
        phrase). This piece of socio-cultural understanding appears to be
        generally accepted, and rightly so. If it needs defending, that will
        have to happen elsewhere, but I have yet to see it seriously contested. 
        Moldbug’s own intellectual pedigree suffices to establish the claim on a
        solid foundation, but it is, in any case, far from aberrant in this
        regard. The recognition that libertarian ideas — despite their
        philosophical elegance and economic attractiveness — are not
        historically or politically realistic, has been the catalytic insight
        driving the development and adoption of neoreactionary
        <a href="http://blog.jim.com/culture/what-unites-neoreaction.html">alternatives</a>, shorn of certain mythical
        elements inherited by the progressive
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cladistic-meditations/">clade</a>
        (substantial egalitarianism most prominently). This is an empirically
        robust, uncontroversial story, but it is not yet a formula. It’s time to
        take the next step.

        Has there yet emerged a neoreactionary who was once a ‘liberaltarian’?
        This isn’t a question designed to embarrass anybody. I just think the
        answer is easily predictable. When neoreactionary intelligence perceives
        this shambling wreckage of all cognitive integrity, it recoils into
        itself in utter revulsion. Everything it abominated about the
        libertarian delusion stands before it, trickling pitifully. This is the
        perfect caricature of its abandoned errors: an oozing swippleous mass of
        unreflective universalism. It’s classical liberalism revived as an
        undead decay-plague. (If Karl wants to go
        <a href="http://radishmag.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/white-right/">after</a>
        this thing with a shot-gun, I don’t see

        <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/05/26/conservative-principles-liberaltarian-afterthoughts/">view</a>
        from the unlibertarianized left is illuminating:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… the conscience of a Lindseyan liberaltarian is pretty darn liberal
          – with some policy disputes on top. When Lindsey stands with
          conservatives it is mostly on somewhat accidental (but not therefore
          inconsiderable) policy grounds. He thinks liberals tend to adopt
          self-defeating policies. When Lindsey stands with liberals it is
          mostly on philosophical grounds. This point fits in with the one I
          made in
          <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/04/15/libertarianism-property-rights-and-self-ownership/">this
            pos</a>t,
          about different sorts of libertarians: basically liberal or
          basically feudal. If you are a feudal libertarian, you really
          shouldn’t have a problem with Jim Crow, in principle. If you are a
          liberal libertarian, you should. Conservative libertarians tend to be
          on the fence, feudalism/liberalism-wise. (This depends partly on a
          cheeky use of ‘feudal’ – see my post. But, then again, what was Edmund
          Burke? a guy who was torn between liberalism and feudalism. That’s not
          such a bad sketch of his personality-type.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Strangely, we’re still talking about Jim Crow — as if the entire meaning
        of American history is expressed through that. The target here is Barry
        Goldwater, but it makes no substantial difference if Ron Paul is
        substituted. The critical point, in both cases, is that a reluctance to
        countenance the expansion of the political sphere in pursuit of racial
        egalitarianism is interpreted as a moral scandal, for which an
        ostentatious sacrifice of liberty is the only permissible solution.
        Negligence is already ‘feudalism’. When this dam bursts — into
        ‘liberaltarian’ compromise — the micro-managerial state has already been
        granted everything  it will need to ask for. Stamping out feudalism
        makes you free. (It works like
        <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/proof-that-libertarianism-is-racist/">this</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If it wasn’t for Hoppe, it would perhaps be understandable if the
        shuddering neoreactionary (N) were to suspect that libertarian thought
        (L0) tends — slowly but inevitably — to compost down towards this
        liberaltarian (L1) ‘walker’, in which all the degenerative forces of
        conformism <em>and</em> revolt have been compacted, as if by some
        ideological parody of providence. Is not our liberaltarian zombie the
        still-recognizable avatar of the old liberalism, resurrected hideously
        as the animated putrescence of the new? Yet we have Hoppe, and so we
        know that the directives of self-coordinating liberty need not take this
        path. There is, unmistakably, something other to libertarianism than
        what is seen in the figure of its zombified, liberaltarian ruin. Through
        a type of negative political theology, we can formulate it:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lo – L1 = N</strong></p>
      <p>
        First, identify every specifically emphatic feature of liberaltarianism,
        then subtract it without residue from the old Austro-libertarian matrix,
        and what remains is the neoreactionary template — abstracted due to the
        provisional (negative) place-holders for yet undeveloped topics:
        presumed non-equality, non-universality, non-progress (in socio-cultural
        matters), and at least partial non-autonomy (of the economic agent from
        fragile structures of civility). Slaying the zombie does not, in itself,
        fill these gaps — but it <em>holds open the gaps</em>, and therefore the
        avenues of neoreactionary exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a rule of thumb: whatever
        <a href="http://willwilkinson.wordpress.com/">Will Wilkinson</a> is
        having, I’ll have the opposite. If the liberaltarian innovation is
        conceived as a vector, its exact negation sets the neoreactionary
        course. With this conclusion, science is served. We can return the
        corpse of a misconceived ‘progressive’ liberty to its grave, or rather,
        to the cyclopean mausoleum it has made for itself: the liberal
        super-state which protects freedom in detail, with unbounded
        attentiveness, until it has been obliterated entirely from the earth.

          are far from the worst failures. The biggest fiascos by dollar value
          are
          <a href="http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/scandals">the various government programs</a>
          designed to win the war on drugs or poverty which after having spent
          trillions of dollars fruitlessly, lie somewhere in an unmarked
          bureaucratic grave.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A price tag doesn’t do justice to these calamities, which are not only
        wasteful, but positively and perversely harmful, but it’s a start. The
        category of ‘waste’ itself fails here, because it would actually be less
        culturally toxic for all the resources squandered on social programs to
        be simply annihilated into hyperspace without remainder. Ruinous
        dependency incentives would then be hugely lessened.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the idea that dysfunctional political institutions will
        cooperate with their own public humiliation is also a piece of lunacy
        (and this time, one that beltway libertarians are peculiarly prone to).

            not be a coincidence</a>: That is, libertarianism makes assumptions about what’s normal for
          everyone on the basis of the white experience. Normally, that’s a
          point made by the left as a criticism, but the whiteness of
          libertarianism is increasingly accepted by post-libertarian
          reactionaries like Moldbug as a badge of honor. It could also indicate
          a wider trend in the future, if a combination of demographic changes
          and political projects to “<a

    <div class="entry">
      <p>Confession No.1: I generally like Don Boudreaux’s writing a lot.</p>
      <p>
        Confession No.2: I think
        <a href="http://cafehayek.com/2013/06/immigration-the-practice-of-the-principle.html">this</a>
        is simply insane. By that I mean: I simply don’t get it, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boudreaux begins by explaining the concerns of a “few friends whose
        opinions I hold in the highest regard” that “immigrants will use their
        growing political power to vote for government policies that are more
        interventionist and less respectful of individual freedoms.” Hard to
        imagine, I know. Especially if one ignores insignificant examples such
        as — ummm — <em>the state of fricking California</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It then gets weirder. We learn that “concern over the likely voting
        patterns of immigrants is nothing new.  Past fears seem, from the
        perspective of 2013, to have been unjustified.” I’m about to poison my
        nervous-system with my own sarcasm at this point, so instead I’ll simply
        ask, as politely as possible: What would count as evidence of America
        moving in a direction that was “more interventionist and less respectful
        of individual freedoms”? Would it look anything at all like what we’ve
        seen — in highly-accelerated mode — since the passage of the 1965
        Immigration and Nationality Act?
      </p>
      <p>Then comes the overt celebration of libertarian suicidalism:</p>
      <p>
        <em>But let’s assume for the moment that today’s immigrants – those
          immigrants recently arrived and those who would arrive under a more
          liberalized immigration regime – are indeed as likely as my concerned
          friends fear to vote overwhelmingly to move American economic policy
          in a much more <strong>dirigiste</strong> direction.  Such a move
          would, I emphatically and unconditionally agree, be very bad. Very.
          Bad. Indeed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I still support open immigration. I cannot bring myself to abandon
          support of my foundational principles just because following those
          principles might prove fatal.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, they

        When it comes to the libertarian
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/suicidal-libertarianism/">suicide</a>
        race, Bryan Caplan leaves Don Boudreaux in the dust. Caplan takes the
        Non-Aggression Principle and runs with it, all the way into a
        maximum-velocity self-directed death cult. (<a
          href="http://habitableworlds.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/341/">Self</a>-directed, solely in the ideological
        sense,
        of course.) Given the
        considerable merits of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter">this</a>
        book, in particular, it’s a sad thing to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        American libertarianism has always been vulnerable to neo-puritan
        spiritual extravagance. Caplan systematically pushes this tendency to
        its limit, divorcing its arguments from any realistic estimation of
        consequences, and transforming it into a form of deontological moral
        fanaticism, in which self-defense, retaliation, and boundaries are
        strictly prohibited. He envisages a world of games in which only
        unilateral altruism is permissible to the libertarian player. It would
        be fun to go a few rounds of prisoner’s dilemma with him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Naturally, when it comes to unconditional
        support for open borders irrespective of political consequences, Caplan

        Perhaps Caplan really believes his own arguments, but if so he has
        driven himself insane. If you doubt this for a moment, it’s only going

        <em>If you care as much about immigrants as natives, this is no reason to
          oppose immigration. Consider the following example:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Suppose there are two countries with equal populations. The quality
          of policy ranges from 0-10, 10 being best. In country A, bliss points
          (people’s first choice for policy) are uniformly distributed from 2-6.
          In country B, bliss points are uniformly distributed from 4-8.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What does democratic competition deliver? When the countries are
          independent, country A gets a policy quality of 4 (the median of the
          uniform distribution from 2-6), and country B gets a policy quality of
          6 (the median of the uniform distribution from 4-8). Average policy
          that people live under: 50%*4+50%*6=5.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now suppose you open the borders, and everyone moves to country B
          (the richer country). The median of the whole distribution is 5.
          Result: The immigrants live under better policies, the natives live
          under worse policies. The average (5) remains unchanged.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Speechless yet? (I’m halfway through a blogpost, so I can’t afford to
        be.) The argument: Any attempt to live under a regime that is anything
        other than the averaged political idiocy of humanity as a whole is a
        gross human rights violation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        You don’t like the way Pakistanis manage their national affairs? Too
        bad. Libertarianism (Caplan style) insists that it’s your duty to
        promote the homogenization of the world’s political cultures because,
        after all, if there’s anything at all good going on at your end, think
        how happy it will make the Pakistanis when it gets shared out. Heading
        into a stirred gruel of deeply degenerated liberal capitalism and
        Islamo-feudalism is best for everybody, taken on average. If it’s not
        tasting right, it’s because you’ve not yet thrown in enough African
        tribal warfare and Polynesian head-hunting for the full moral hit. Or
        how about mixing Singapore and Bangladesh into a human paste? Anything
        less is tantamount to genocide.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This argument is so bad that the very idea of responding to it makes me
        throw up a little in my mouth, but duty calls. Since Caplan claims to be
        a libertarian, let’s start with an unobjectionable principle —
        competition. If any institution is to work, it’s because competition
        keeps it in line. This requires a number of things, all of them
        incompatible with homogenization: experimental variation, differential
        support for comparison, local absorption of consequences, and selection
        through elimination of failure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Consider two companies: Effective Inc. and Loserbum Corp. Both have very
        different corporate cultures, adequately reflected in their names. Under
        market conditions, Loserbum Corp. either learns some lessons from
        Effective Inc., or it goes under. Net benefit or no great loss to the
        world in either case.<br />
        But along comes Caplan, to bawl out the stockholders, management, and
        other employees of Effective Inc. “You monsters! Don’t you care at all
        about the guys at Loserbum Corp.? They have the same moral status as
        you, don’t you know? Here’s the true, radical free-market plan: All
        managers and workers of Loserbum get to enter your company, work there,
        introduce their business strategies and working practices,until we reach
        equilibrium. Equilibrium is what markets are all about, see? Sure,
        Effective Inc. will degenerate significantly, but imagine all the
        utility gains of the poor Loserbums! It all comes out in the wash.”<br />
        <em>But … but … countries aren’t companies</em>. Well, maybe not
        exactly, but they’re competitive institutions, or at least, the more
        they are, the better they work. The most important thing is true equally
        of both — to the extent they are able to externalize and pool their
        failure, the less they will learn.<br />
        In a world that has any chance of working, the Loserbum culture has a
        choice: learn or fail. Caplan introduces a third possibility — share
        (average out, or homogenize). His maths is idiotic. The contribution
        that Singapore makes to the world has almost nothing to do with the
        utility gains to its tiny population. Instead, it is a model — Effective
        Inc. — whose contribution to the world is to show all the Loserbums what
        they are. Swamp it with Loserbums, destroy it, and that function is
        gone. If that had happened before the late 1970s, the PRC would probably
        still be a neo-Maoist hellhole. It didn’t flood Singapore with 300
        million poor peasants, instead, it learnt from Singapore’s example.
        That’s how the world really works (when it does). Institutional examples
        matter. Caplan’s world would annihilate all of them, leaving fairly
        averaged, three-quarter Loserbums grunting at each other in a
        libertarian-communist swamp. Nothing would work anywhere. There could be
        no lessons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Still, Caplan has other arguments. The best, by far, is that wrecking a
        society to the point of generalized mutual detestation is the best way
        to shrink the welfare state. It goes like
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/the_social_and.html">this</a>:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>Although poor immigrants are likely to support a bigger welfare state
          than natives do, the presence of poor immigrants makes natives turn
          against the welfare state. Why would this be? As a rule, people are
          happy to vote to “take care of their own”; that’s what the welfare
          state is all about. So when the poor are culturally very similar to
          the rich, as they are in places like Denmark and Sweden, support for
          the welfare state tends to be uniformly strong.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>As the poor become more culturally distant from the rich, however,
          support for the welfare state becomes weaker and less uniform.</em>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        This argument is so freaking Mad Max that I actually quite like it. Burn
        down the world and you take the welfare state with it. Yeeaaaahhhhh!
        (I’ll leave it to more responsible voices to point out any possible
        flaws.)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Then there’s the “non-natives are markedly less likely to vote than
        natives” argument (from the same post, and all the rest). It makes you
        wonder what a large population of enfranchised but non-voting
        anti-capitalists engenders. Something
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Community_Organizations_for_Reform_Now">good</a>, surely?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Best of all is the capstone contortionist analogy: “Native voters under
        30 are more hostile to markets and liberty than immigrants ever were.
        Why not just kick them out?”  Oh yes, oh yes, could we? Or at least stop
        them voting. Without some arrangement for the mass-disenfranchisement of
        leftist voters there’s no chance of anything except continuous decay,
        and age restriction might be as good a place as any to start.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <em>My position in a sentence … is that immigration restrictions are a
          vastly greater crime against markets and liberty than anything
          immigrant voters are likely to manage.<br />
        </em>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Thank Gnon that no one listens to libertarians.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/07/statism_for_fre.html">ADDED</a>: Caplan doubles down,
        with
        some mouth-watering hypotheticals. If
        States ever made these kind of choices, they’d be fun to keep around,
        but the whole point is that <em>of course they never would</em>.  (Don’t
        miss the darkly-infiltrated comments thread.)<br />
        …  and yet
        <a href="http://cafehayek.com/2013/06/wisdom-from-a-good-aussie-friend.html">more</a>
        attractive counter-democratic hypotheticals. By the time the
        deontological libertarians have finished with this, they’ll have
        designed a minutely-detailed neoreactionary policy platform for us.

      <h4 class="post-title">An Abstract Path to Freedom</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        At
        <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/randoms-118/">this</a>
        thread (and in other places), commenter VXXC cites Durant’s Dark
        Counsel: “For freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies,
        and when one prevails the other dies. Leave men free, and their natural
        inequalities will multiply almost geometrically.” He then remarks:
        “That’s fine with me, I’ll go with Freedom.” <i>Outside in</i> concurs
        without reservation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take this dark counsel as the thesis that a practically-significant
        ideological dimension can be constructed, within which freedom and
        egalitarianism are related as strictly reciprocal variables. Taking this
        dimension for orientation, two abstract models of demographic
        redistribution can be examined, in order to identify
        <i>what it is that neoreactionaries want</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Caplan-Boudreaux Suicidal Libertarianism
        Model (SLM), touched upon
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/suicidal-libertarianism/">here</a>,
        and then sketched
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/suicidal-libertarianism-part-doh/">here</a>, takes the following
        arithmetical
        form:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Suppose there are two countries with equal populations. The quality
          of policy ranges from 0-10, 10 being best. In country A, bliss points
          (people’s first choice for policy) are uniformly distributed from 2-6.
          In country B, bliss points are uniformly distributed from 4-8. […]
          When the countries are independent, country A gets a policy quality of
          4 (the median of the uniform distribution from 2-6), and country B
          gets a policy quality of 6 (the median of the uniform distribution
          from 4-8). Average policy that people live under: 50%*4+50%*6=5. …
          suppose you open the borders, and everyone moves to country B (the
          richer country). The median of the whole distribution is 5. Result:
          The immigrants live under better policies, the natives live under
          worse policies. The average (5) remains unchanged.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        A few preparatory tweaks help to smooth the proceedings. Firstly,
        convert Caplan’s “bliss points” to freedom coefficients (from ‘0’ or
        absolute egalitarianism, to ‘1’ or unconstrained liberty). A society in
        which freedom was maximized would not be wholly unequal (Gini
        coefficient 1.0), but it would be wholly indifferent to inequality as a
        problem. In other words, egalitarian concerns would have zero policy
        impact. It is in this sense, alone, that freedom is perfected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly (and automatically), the question-begging judgments of “better”
        and “worse” are displaced by the ideological reciprocals of freedom and
        equality – there is no need to compel acquiescence as to the objective
        merits of either. Indeed, there is every reason to encourage those
        unconvinced of the superior attractions of liberty to seek ideological
        satisfaction in an egalitarian realm, elsewhere. From the perspective of
        liberty, egalitarian exodus is an unambiguous – even supreme – good,
        analogous to political entropy dissipation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is further, tacitly presumed here that freedom coefficients correlate
        linearly with intelligence optimization, but this depends upon further
        argument, to be bracketed for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extraordinary theoretical value of the SLM can now be demonstrated.
        Due to its radical egalitarianism it defines a pessimal limit for
        neoreaction, and thus – by strict inversion – describes the abstract
        program for a restoration of free society (the Neoreactionary Model of
        demographic redistribution, or NM). In order to chart this reversal, the
        simplest course is to presuppose the full accomplishment of the SLM in
        an arbitrary ‘geographical’ space, which it taken to be flexibly
        divisible, and populated by 320 million people, SLM-homogenized to a
        freedom coefficient of 0.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confining ourselves to the tools already employed in the establishment
        of the climax SLM (whilst – for the sake of lucid presentation —
        ignoring any
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">degenerative ratchet</a>
        asymmetries), let us now proceed on the path of reversal. The SLM
        conservation law holds that average freedom is preserved, so an initial
        schism produces two equal populations – equivalent to those of Caplan’s
        starting point – each numbering 160 million, but now differentiated on
        the dark counsel dimension, with freedom coefficients of 0.6 and 0.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursue this fissional procedure of territorial / population division and
        ideological differentiation recursively, focusing exclusively upon the
        comparatively free segment each time. The 160 million 0.6s become 80
        million 0.7s, and an equal number of 0.5s. After five iterations, the
        final neoreactionary-secessionist de-homogenized distribution is
        reached:
      </p>
      <p>
        160 million x 0.4<br />
        80 million x 0.5<br />
        40 million x 0.6<br />
        20 million x 0.7<br />
        10 million x 0.8, and – incarnating the meaning of world history, or at
        least absorbing neoreactionary exaltation —<br />
        10 million x 1.0
      </p>
      <p>
        Roughly 3% of the original population now live in a truly free society.
        For Caplan and other SLM-proponents, of course, nothing at all has been
        gained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, assume instead of SLM utilitarian universalism, on profoundly
        inegalitarian grounds, that the aggregate quantity of freedom was
        considered of vastly lower importance than the
        <i>exemplary quality of freedom</i>, then the neoreactionary achievement
        is stark. Where freedom nowhere existed, now it does, at an essentially
        irrelevant cost of moderate socialist deterioration elsewhere. Half of
        the original population – 160 million souls – have now been released to
        enjoy a ‘fairer’ society than they knew before. Why not congratulate
        them on the fact, without being distracted unduly by the starvation and
        re-education camps? It can be confidently presumed that they would have
        voted for the regime that now takes care of them. Their internal
        political arrangements need no longer concern us.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Neoreaction (the NM), it is not a question of whether people (in
        general) are free, but only whether freedom (somewhere) exists. The
        highest attainment of freedom within the system, rather than the
        averaged level of freedom throughout the system, is its overwhelming
        priority. By reversing the process of demographic redistribution
        envisaged by the SLM, its ends are achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The zero-sum utilitarian conclusions of this comparison would be
        unsettled by a more concrete elaboration of the NM, in which the effects
        of exemplarity, competition,  the positive externalities of
        techno-economic performance, and other influences of freedom were
        included. At the present level of abstraction — set by Caplan’s own (SL)
        model — such positive spin-offs might seem no more than sentimental
        concessions to common feeling. It is the ruthless core of the
        Neoreactionary Model that has, initially, to assert itself. Better the
        greatest possible freedom, even for a few, than a lesser freedom for
        all. Quality matters most.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quasi-Rawlesian objection — fully implicit within the SLM — might
        run: “And what if the free society, as ‘probability’ dictates, is not
        yours?” — our rejoinder: “It would require a despicable egotist not to
        delight in it, even at a distance, as a beacon of aspiration, and an
        idiot or scoundrel not to set out on the same path, in whichever way
        they were able.”

      <p>
        In an intriguing
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/08/expressing_voti.html">post</a>
        on migration and ‘expressive voting’ in Alsace-Lorraine  after the 1871
        annexation, Bryan Caplan notes that although “over 90% of the new
        citizens of the Second Reich voted for … anti-Prussian regional parties”
        only 5% decided to emigrate back to France. Clearly in this case,
        migration patterns revealed genuine commitments — based perhaps on
        economic opportunity — while elections were merely an occasion to
        express ethnic emotionalism without consequence. As usual in human
        affairs, microeconomics was aligned with approximate reason, whilst
        politics was possessed by destructive irrationality, redeemed only by
        its impotence.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s hard to imagine what Caplan is seeing as the politically-correct
        take-away from this example. What it demonstrates starkly is that even
        populations characterized by scrupulous rationality in their private
        economic affairs will exploit electoral opportunities to vote for
        insanity — as judged by their own revealed preferences. Expect even
        model immigrant workers to expend their votes signalling an adherence to
        ethnic zealotry and ruinous economic populism — and in particular, the
        reproduction of exactly those social pathologies they have migrated away
        from. Like the French in post-1871 Alsace-Lorraine, they’ll probably
        vote as if they want to live somewhere they manifestly don’t want to be.
        (But that’s not supposed to be the message, is it?)

      <p>
        Bryan Caplan’s
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/09/the_golden_mean.html">latest</a>
        on the open borders question illuminates an imaginary world. Perhaps the
        strangest thing about this fantasy earth is that it corresponds almost
        perfectly with an achieved libertarian utopia, marred only by pesky
        borders that impede the frictionless completion of labor contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Caplan World there are two significant levels of social organization:
        private owners — fully secure in their property rights — and the human
        race as a whole, struggling to sort itself into productive relationships
        of voluntary cooperation. In his figurative simplification, there are
        households, and there is the planet. Nothing done to de-fragment the
        planet could negatively affect households to any significant extent. In
        fact, they could only benefit from open-access to several billion
        potential tenants. On Caplan World, open-borders is a no-brainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Sol-3, unfortunately, things are not nearly so simple. The most
        obvious reason is that nobody on this planet enjoys secure property
        rights. Freely-contracting Caplan World ‘tenants’ are — in reality —
        also voters, and what they vote upon, most substantially, is other
        people’s property rights. In this, real world, geographical
        fragmentation means that a whole bunch of (once) non-random other people
        <em>do not have any voice in regards to your business</em>. In an age of
        rampant democracy, the only way to maintain this situation is to keep
        them on the other side of a border, at least formally (polite visitors
        don’t get to decide whether your house should be expropriated).
        Eliminate the borders, and the only property rights remaining are those
        that the global population, as a whole, are willing to grant. Does it
        really need to be spelt out that this is not the recipe for a
        libertarian society?
      </p>

        and company of being suicidal lunatics, but they keeps printing out the
        collective suicide notes. These aren’t stupid people. They have to know
        their plans won’t result in the importation of voiceless exit-units, or
        free-contractors, but rather of a new people, already pre-determined by
        democratic assumptions to be particles of political sovereignty — i.e.
        <em>masters</em>. You don’t get to decide (commercially) whether they
        can stay in your house. They get to decide (politically) whether you can
        keep your house. Since they are also disproportionately saturated with
        the bio-cultural heritage of places that have never shown any taste or
        competence for the creation or mere preservation of freedom-tolerant
        institutions, the subsequent democratic decisions — it can reliably be
        predicted — will be horrendous. If this were not so, why would the
        Left-half of the political spectrum be openly salivating about the
        electoral catastrophe in process? (Nobody thinks they’re importing
        reinforcements for the Tea Party.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s probably far too late for any of this to matter. At this point,
        Caplan is just rubbing salty madness into the wounds.

        in succession at Tyler Cowen’s <em>Marginal Revolution</em> acknowledge
        that libertarianism’s suicide-by-population-replacement is proceeding
        according to spontaneous disorder. Completely un-shockingly, mass low-IQ
        immigration from dysfunctional cultures that despise economic liberty
        has pushed libertarian ideas from marginality into complete irrelevance.
        So it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly,
        <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/bad-demographic-news-for-libertarians/">there</a>‘s “Bad Demographic
        News
        for Libertarians” from Arnold Kling. It should
        probably be noted that this isn’t a story being told from an
        immigration-catastrophe angle, so anybody with advanced skills at mental
        segmentation can dismiss it as irrelevant. You need to check the final
        table of the source
        <a href="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2013/11/changes-in-americas-family-structure.html">post</a>,
        by
        Timothy Taylor, to connect the dots. Kling’s sober conclusion: “I
        am afraid that the number of households married to the state has
        soared.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, Cowen
        <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2234200">cites</a>
        this paper by Hal Pashler (a psychologist at UCSD), whose research
        “results showed a marked pattern of lower support for pro-liberty views
        among immigrants as compared to US-born residents. These differences
        were generally statistically significant and sizable, with a few
        scattered exceptions. With increasing proportions of the US population
        being foreign-born, low support for libertarian values by foreign-born
        residents means that the political prospects of libertarian values in
        the US are likely to diminish over time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I just wish there had been some sort of short-cut to self-abolition for
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html#recent">these</a>

        Bryan Caplan
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/06/why_sailer_scar.html">seizes</a>
        upon a two-sentence Steve Sailer comment to fly into theatrical
        conniptions in public:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Does Steve genuinely favor denying half of Americans the right to
          reproduce? It’s hard to know. It is the uncertainty that he carefully
          cultivated that makes Sailer’s thought so scary to so many — including
          me. We shouldn’t have to <strong>wonder</strong> if a thinker approves
          of denying half the population the right to have children.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This really is Caplan at his most despicable. First, set up a bizarre
        counter-factual to support a quite different moral argument by analogy.
        The crudely-telegraphed argumentative strategy is to shift the burden of
        fanaticism from proponents to opponents (“hey, can’t you see that
        restricting immigration is <strong>just like</strong> sterilizing half
        the population”). Secondly, when a commentator corrects your
        counter-factual in the direction of historical reality — i.e. something
        that <em>actually happened</em> — deflect attention by cranking up the
        moral hysteria, while retreating into what seems increasingly to be
        Caplan’s favorite territory — unhinged deontological purism. Finally,
        suggest that the commentator is only mentioning historical reality in
        order to surreptitiously endorse your own preposterous
        thought-experiment as a practical program, thus exposing himself as
        “scary”.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why doesn’t he just say that hyper-Nazi eugenics is wrong?</em> (Of
        course, he has, many times.)
        <em>He probably wants to throw your granny into the biodiesel tanks too.
          Let’s talk about that rather than my project to engineer a national
          immigration apocalypse.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who seriously “wonders” whether Steve Sailer secretly advocates
        sterilizing half of the American population has released their grip on
        the last frayed threads of civilized conversation. Caplan is
        deteriorating from a nut into something far more repulsive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/06/why_sailer_scar.html#324135">ADDED</a>: Sailer responds
        (calmly) —
      </p>
      <p><em>Bryan:</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>Your arguments would get less tangled up if you’d simply keep in mind
          that I’m a moderate who takes reasonable positions, while you are an
          extremist who is drawn to promoting unreasonable ones. Please stop
          projecting your own immoderation upon me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, there is an obvious distinction you fail to recognize
          between my appreciating the difficulties our ancestors went through —
          what Nicholas Wade calls “the Malthusian wringer” that helped make us
          who we are — and my very much not wanting to inflict similar levels of
          competition upon our descendants.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Instead, it’s you who wants to subject the descendants of American
          citizens to the neo-Malthusian nightmare of Open Borders.</em>

        Caplan
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/12/demography_and.html">enters</a>
        the bargaining stage:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… demographic ills can
          <strong>clearly be remedied with more immigration</strong>! Non-white
          immigration is messing up America? Then let in enough white immigrants
          to keep the white share constant. Non-Christian immigration is
          destroying our religious heritage? Then let in enough Christians to
          keep the Christian share constant. Non-Anglophones are turning English
          into a minority language? Then let in enough English-speakers to
          balance them out. Low-IQ immigration is making us dumb? Then let in
          enough high-IQ immigrants to keep up smart.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>This is certainly a viable solution given current levels of
          immigration. The world has hundreds of millions of whites, Christians,
          English-speakers, and IQs&gt;100. At least tens of millions of each
          group would love to permanently move to the U.S. Why haven’t they?
          Because it’s illegal, of course. If the U.S. selectively opened its
          borders to these groups, it could reverse decades of demographic
          change in a matter of years. In fact, the U.S. could admit vastly more
          Third World immigrants without changing overall demographics a bit –
          as long as it concurrently welcomed First World immigrants to balance
          them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the machinery necessary to do that, and it would be possible — in
        fact, almost irresistible — to do something positive with it. (Or does
        demographic engineering only go in one direction?)

        Over at
        <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/" target="_blank">The American Conservative</a>, the Old Right
        has
        expressed its smoldering dismay at the country’s
        political prospects through a fit of paralyzed dissensus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 29 members of the TAC
        <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-conservative-vote-a-symposium/"
          target="_blank">symposium</a>
        split fairly evenly between (Democrat) Barack Obama, (Republican) Mitt
        Romney, and (Libertarian) Gary Johnson. Each musters four definite
        commitments, with Andrew J. Bacevich, Leon Hadar, Scott McConnell, and
        Noah Millman for Obama; Marian Kester Coombs, James P. Pinkerton,
        Stephen B. Tippins Jr., and John Zmirak for Romney; and Doug Bandow,
        Peter Brimelow, Scott Galupo, and Bill Kauffman for Johnson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Philip Giraldi epitomizes the spirit of anti-neoconservative
        obstreperousness with his declared electoral intentions, wavering
        between a vote for Johnson, a Ron Paul write-in, or a Romney-spavining
        Obama choice if the race is tight. James Bovard is also torn between
        Johnson and a Ron Paul write-in (but without mention of an anti-Romney
        Obama option). Like Johnson, Romney picks up two additional ‘maybes’
        (from W. James Antle III, Bradley J. Birzer). The Constitution Party’s
        Virgil Goode musters just one solid supporter (Sean Scallon). There’s
        also a write-in for Rand Paul (Daniel McCarthy), and four
        indecipherables (Jeremy Beer, Rod Dreher, William S. Lind, and Steve
        Sailer).
      </p>
      <p>
        Decisive winner among the TAC writers, however, is Nobody, supported by
        seven unambiguous abstentions (Michael Brendan Dougherty, David Gordon,
        Robert P. Murphy, Justin Raimondo, Sheldon Richman, and Gerald J.
        Russello), and probably an eighth (Paul Gottfried, poised at the
        democratically-abstemious edge of the indecipherables).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps questions like
        <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/17/who-does-the-government-intend-to-shoot/#ixzz2AD7K3VCi"

      </p>

        Could it perhaps be because democratic party politics has exhaustively
        demonstrated its incompatibility with “Freedom and Liberty”, “Leave Me
        Alone”, and a “free people”?

        Reaction is not Neoreaction (but still Conservatism). Alain Finkielkraut
        <a
          href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-french-philosopher-finkielkraut-on-muslims-and-integration-a-937404-2.html">explains</a>
        to Spiegel:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><b>SPIEGEL</b>: What do you say to people who call you a
          reactionary?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><b>Finkielkraut</b>: It has become impossible to see history as
          constant progress. I reserve the possibility to compare yesterday and
          today and ask the question: What do we retain, what do we abandon?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><b>SPIEGEL</b>: Is that really any more than nostalgia for a lost
          world?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><b>Finkielkraut</b>: Like Albert Camus, I am of the opinion that our
          generation’s task is not to recreate the world, but to prevent its
          decline. We not only have to conserve nature, but also culture. There
          you have the reactionary.</em>

        <em>AoS</em> two days in a row, which is a sign that I like the place.
        It’s far smarter than it attempts to appear, which is always attractive,
        and it’s among the wittiest blogs I know (by which I mean painfully
        funny, quite often). There are also writers at <em>AoS</em> that I
        almost agree with, but when they’re reaching the line, or threshold of
        escape, and are just about to cross over into the open country beyond,
        something catches them — and you know it’s going to pull them back in.
        Conservatism has them hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ace is a comparative squish in his own house. Some of his comrades are
        considerably <em>meaner</em>, so they get out further. It’s one of Ace’s
        own pieces that triggers this, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/348271.php">Writing</a> about the
        attempt by Mozilla employees to purge CEO Brendan Eich from the company
        he built, he notes that the only ‘ground’ floated for this effort is
        private, discreet political speech, in the form of a small donation made
        to the successful (anti-gay marriage) Proposition 8 campaign, six years
        ago. Their attack on Eich — conducted through Twitter — is a contrary
        type of political speech, more attuned to the PC <em>Zeitgeist</em>, but
        in every other way less defensible. If anyone is going to be fired, why
        shouldn’t it be the twitterati lynch mob? Ace muses. (Good question.)
      </p>
      <p>The post concludes with the lucid observation:</p>
      <p>
        <em>The left has laid down the rule that <strong>their</strong> political
          rights shall never been infringed by an economic penalty, because
          McCarthyism. While they meanwhile demand the exact same sort of
          McCarthyism for everyone else.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So what could possibly be objectionable
        about that, from the perspective of the outer right? What’s
        objectionable — and in fact even maddening — about this insight is its
        <em>conservatism</em>, which it to say that, even after recognizing the
        relentlessly steepening leftist gradient in the dominant culture, the
        implicit message is only: <em>carry on</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the sole point is to say “this isn’t fair” it might be even more
        pointless than saying nothing at all. Keeping people in the ‘fairness’
        frame is part of the captivity, and it’s why conservatives are never
        going to do anything but lose. This whole situation isn’t ‘unfair’ —
        it’s disastrous. It’s ruin. There’s not any kind of game happening here
        that could somehow be made ‘fair’. There’s a civilizational calamity in
        process which is <em>intrinsically tilted</em> and leads, with
        accelerating glacial inevitability, only in one direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conservatives — even atheist conservatives — could be minimally expected
        to have held onto that “hate the sin, not the sinner” recommendation
        from their collapsed religious tradition. Even if they’re not going to
        hate leftists, they have no excuse for avoiding icy hatred of leftism,
        and that means never giving it the benefit of the doubt by implying,
        even for a moment, that it can pursue anything other than the total
        destruction of its enemies, by any means necessary. Leftism isn’t going
        to be shamed <em>out of winning</em>. It isn’t going to be taught a
        lesson. It isn’t going to recognize its internal contradictions. The
        only thing it’s ever going to do, is continue pushing civilization down
        the slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conservatism is congenitally incapable of recognizing the true
        malignancy of its foe. It’s always looking for the next tactical edge,
        the next opportunity to slow down the calamity just a little, the next
        disastrous deal. It’s conservatism that allowed the relentless collapse
        to happen, by presenting a self-defeating alternative to the one thing
        that’s really needed — <em>counter-revolution</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now the brain-washed idiots at Mozilla are trying to purge their boss
        in pursuit of Cathedral spiritual purity, and they’re getting away with
        it. The answer to that isn’t to point out their hypocrisy, or the sad
        state of society in general, while hoping the GOP wins one. It’s to
        destroy the GOP and get real about defeating the left. That’s going to
        require a social order in which the left doesn’t necessarily win, or at
        least the end of the social order in which it always does. Sooner or
        later, conservatism has to move on.

        The only thing that Neoconservatism has to offer a non-psychotic policy
        analyst is bitching, but sometimes the bitching can be pretty good.
        <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-meltdown/">Bret Stephens</a>
        (via
        <a href="https://twitter.com/amerika_blog">Brett Stevens</a> (sorry, I
        had to do that)):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… None of these fiascos — for brevity’s sake, I’m deliberately
          setting to one side the illusory pivot to Asia, the misbegotten
          Russian Reset, the mishandled Palestinian–Israeli talks, the stillborn
          Geneva conferences on Syria, the catastrophic interim agreement with
          Iran, the de facto death of the U.S. free-trade agenda, the overhyped
          opening to Burma, the orphaned victory in Libya, the poisoned
          relationship with Egypt, and the disastrous cuts to the Defense budget
          — can be explained away as a matter of tough geopolitical luck. Where,
          then, does the source of failure lie? […] The myth of Obama’s
          brilliance paradoxically obscures the fact that he’s no fool. The
          point is especially important to note because the failure of Obama’s
          foreign policy is not, ultimately, a reflection of his character or
          IQ. It is the consequence of an ideology.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ‘ideology’ at its root, of course, is evangelical egalitarian
        universalism, and it is one the Neoconservatives entirely share. At the
        limit, which is now being encountered, what America <em>is</em> makes it
        impossible for it to succeed at what it wants.

        AoS has a “Fudamental Concepts”
        <a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/354980.php">post</a> about the
        zero-sum mentality, which it identifies with leftism, getting a lot of
        things convincingly right. Unintentionally, however, it exposes the
        limits of conservatism, and — even more unintentionally — suggests why
        NRx is something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zero sum games are wars, and market (or catallactic) economics are
        indeed different. It was by putting war to bed too early, that
        conservatism destined itself to the ratchet of defeat. Treat an enemy as
        a business partner, and you lose, over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The payoff matrix is easy to draw. Re-purposing a prisoner’s dilemma
        quadrate works fine.
      </p>

            width="666" /></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Treat “Stay Silent” as a positive-sum contract, and “Confess and Betray”
        as stubborn zero-sum antagonism. Searching for positive-sum engagement
        with a committed zero-sum opponent is the loser’s game that the
        mainstream ‘right’ has been playing for centuries. It’s the reason
        libertarians are so often dismissed as smart imbeciles (or
        <a href="http://www.nonzero.org/">worse</a>). There’s business, and
        there’s war, and only the latter is definitely not going anywhere. In
        reality, (positive-sum) capitalism depends upon (zero-sum)
        counter-revolution. Otherwise, the right ‘stays silent’ while the left
        ‘confesses and betrays’. Our little matrix, and the course of recent
        global history, equally exhibit where that leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Positive-sum is the civilized order at the end of a far dirtier process.
        In the interim, if it hurts the left it’s worth doing, unless it hurts
        you more.

        Forget the headline, which is just a pretext — this
        <a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/355602.php">post</a> is really
        something. A couple of highlights:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They think that our desire for a better America will draw us to vote
          for the Least Worst candidates. […] But many of us now feel like the
          Communists, or the hardcore paleocons: There really is not a large
          enough difference between the two parties any more to
          <strong>bother oneself in terms of emotional and financial investment any
            longer</strong>. […] Either way, we will have some form of repressive, unresponsive
          socialism in this country; what should we care whether the National
          Welfare Depot is painted in Red or Blue? […] I’m not coming back. I’m
          done. For the past ten years of my life, I’ve made arguments, some of
          which I knew to be false, to defend and apologize for the GOP; I see
          now that I was a fool to do so.</em>
      </p>
      <p>And:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Here’s Some Truth: We all know this, but being Part of the Team, I
          felt obligated to lie, because I figured you expected me to lie, even
          though you didn’t believe it. […] So yeah: The GOP is never repealing
          Obamacare or even trying hard to do so. They will make false efforts
          at doing so which they can present to voters as a Good College Try,
          but aw shucks, we couldn’t quite do it. […] It’s a relief to no longer
          have to propagate this obvious, feeble lie. […] I know very few of you
          believe the GOP has much intention of repealing Obamacare, but, being
          a Republican, I have previously felt the need to present The Official
          Party Position even knowing it was total bullshit. […] I’ve known it
          was a lie for a year, which is why I hate when it comes up on, say,
          the Podcast. What am I supposed to say? Am I supposed to pretend the
          GOP is going to repeal it? […] So they’re not. They never were. […] It
          was always a lie.</em>

        it.

          lost, you lost, you lost. […] With a white majority these issues were
          winnable, because whites vote conservative in the majority. But by
          being cowards on the issue of immigration and bending over for the
          left’s quite open plan of demographic replacement of whites in order
          to secure a permanent nonwhite left wing majority you lost. In 8 years
          it may be demographically impossible for the GOP to win a national
          election ever again. Even your precious Christian issues are done.
          Even your cucking for Israel is under threat. Do you think a nonwhite
          majority in the US is going to be keen to support your favorite
          ethnostate? They side with the Palestinians! […] You lost everything,
          and all because you were afraid a group of communists, atheists and
          homosexuals would call you racist.</em>

        Thing is — Progressivism happened in the USA without the help of massive
        Hispanic immigration, or even women’s suffrage. It happened because
        democratically-empowered <em>white men</em> had been persuaded to
        dismantle capitalism by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan">populist</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">politicians</a>. The ‘right wing’ party that they’d
        be
        supporting in that map? It’s
        the Republican Party of 2012, and its Presidential Candidate Mitt
        Romney, Governor of (freaking) <em>Massachusetts</em>. So what this is
        saying, at best, is that American White Men can now be persuaded to
        freeze in place the catastrophic ruin of Western Civilization as it
        stood roughly during Phase-1 Obamanation. Is there any suggestion from
        this that there’s support for rolling back politicized money, The Great
        Society, The New Deal, or the violent destruction of American
        federalism? In fact, any indication of support for actual
        <em>right wing policies</em> at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        As a counter factual, I guess — just possibly — an uprising of White Men
        could help to get Trump into the White House, which would be
        <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2015/07/25/3684164/case-for-donald-trump/">ambiguous</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s fun — really it is — but it’s not going anywhere, because it
        doesn’t even start to get a grip on where things went wrong.

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/crypto-capitalism/">
    <h4 class="post-title">Crypto-Capitalism</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Political language is <em>systematically confusing</em>, in a
      distinctive way. Its significant terms are only secondarily theoretical,
      as demonstrated by radical shifts in sense that express informal
      policies of meaning. Descriptions of political position are moves in a
      game, before they are neutral accounts of the rules, or even of the
      factions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be excessively digressive to embark on yet another expedition
      into the history of such political terms as ‘liberal’, ‘progress’,
      ‘fascism’, or ‘conservative’. Everyone knows that these words are
      profoundly uninformative without extensive historical qualification, or
      rough-and-ready adaptation to the dictates of guided fashion. If
      consistent theoretical use of any political label conflicts with its
      maximally effective political use, the former will be sacrificed without
      hesitation — and always has been. That is why neologisms are typically
      required for even the most fleeting approximation to theoretical
      precision, whenever political affiliation is at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A point in favor of the ‘crypto-‘ prefix is that it plays directly into
      such confusion. As a politically-significant marker, it bears two
      strongly differentiated, yet intersecting senses. It indicates (a) that
      a political phenomenon has been re-assembled in disguise, and (b) that
      cryptographic techniques are essential to its identity. Hence,
      respectively, ‘crypto-communism’ and ‘crypto-currencies’. Any attempt to
      engage in an initial clarification cuts across the intrinsically
      occulted character of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Crypto-capitalism’ — therefore — might be
      one thing, or two, if it is anything at all. If clarity is to be brought
      to the topic, it will certainly not be self-promoted. Whatever
      crypto-capitalism might be, structural misunderstanding has to be the
      most prominent part of it. Hiding is essential to whatever it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      What crypto-capitalism is not, first practically, and subsequently
      theoretically, is pseudo-capitalism, or ‘capitalism’ as it is publicly
      recognized. Rather than engaging in futile struggle over the ‘true
      meaning’ of capitalism, crypto-capitalism proceeds with a surreptitious
      appropriation of terminological confusion, functionalized as camouflage.
      It <em>does</em> capitalism, all the more effectively, because the
      grinding mill of political language works predictably, providing it with
      cover. The loss of terminological integrity is invested, from a position
      of intense cynicism, as an opportunity to develop off stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudo-capitalism is (by now) the
      <a href="http://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/the-lies-arent-all-right/">host</a>
      of the Cathedral. It feeds a mega-parasite, which — employing
      unprecedented powers of narrative construction — claims to be the source
      of its vitality. Evolving far beyond an initial stage of conspicuous
      resource extraction, the Cathedralized — or culture-potent — state now
      more-or-less directly controls the ‘capitalist’ brain, in more ways than
      can be readily enumerated. ‘Capitalists’ are Cathedralized through
      educational and media indoctrination, social selection, regulatory
      discipline, seductive alliance, and ‘transcendental’ subordination to a
      financial system that has been subverted to its foundations by the magic
      of power. The mere denomination of ‘capitalism’ in fiat currency
      expresses the domain of pseudo-capitalism with remarkable exactitude.
      The meaning of the host is (articulated through) the virus it sustains.
      Any suggestion of opposition in this relationship is entirely fake,
      because it belongs to the same magical performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prohibition exemplifies this stage show. Publicly pitting cops against
      gangsters, what it represents is the spectacular definition of the
      ‘white economy’ (pseudo-capitalism) over against the ‘black economy’ or
      ‘organized crime’ (crypto-capitalism). The same story can be told in the
      decadent USSR, without any need for substantial revision. Whatever
      refuses denomination in the signs of power is a pathological aberration,
      to be renormalized as a productive <del>parasited host</del> social
      body.

      <em>… one of the most popular websites that use and promote the use of

        cocaine, and arrested its owner, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
        said on Wednesday. The FBI arrested Ross William Ulbricht, known as
        “Dread Pirate Roberts,” in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to

      (noted <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-notes-21/">here</a>) to
      recall some realistic context, and plausible historical analogy. The
      Prohibition of the 1920s was an endless source of cop-on-gangster drama,
      none of which had any realistically persuasive  meaning as the
      successful pursuit of policy. Instead, gangsters used the cops, as a
      tactical resource for black-economy dispute ‘resolution’. (In the
      Shanghai of the same epoch, the Opium-trafficking ‘Green Gang’ managed
      to get their agent ‘Pock-marked Huang’ installed as chief of the French
      Concession police — an admittedly extreme example of a typical
      tendency.) From the perspective of the outer economy, cops are a cheap
      way to smash your competition.

      <em>IT’S A RULE AS TIMELESS as black markets: Where illegal money goes,

      <em>In late April Silk Road went offline for nearly a week, straining
        under a sustained cyberattack that left its sensitive data untouched
        but overwhelmed its servers. The attack, according to Roberts, was the
        most sophisticated in Silk Road’s history, taking advantage of
        previously unknown vulnerabilities in Tor and repeatedly shifting
        tactics to avoid the site’s defenses.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The sabotage occurred within weeks of rival site Atlantis’ launch.

      <em>Outside in</em> it appears incontrovertible that ‘Roberts’ had
      already predicted this ‘sting’ — in far greater detail than anybody else
      has done — and that the antagonist he pre-emptively, if subtly, fingered
      was a shadowy crypto-capitalist competitor, rather than the forces of
      pseudo-capitalist suppression. If this was a <em>cryptic </em>event, it
      would be inexcusably negligent not to ask: Who (or what) is the FBI
      really — even if unwittingly — working for? “For the ultimate glory of
      the white (pseudo-capitalist) economy” is certainly one possible answer,

    <h4 class="post-title">Dark Techno-Commercialism</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Each of the three main strands of neoreaction, insofar as they are
      remotely serious, attaches itself to something that no politics could
      absorb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reality of a religious commitment cannot be resolved into its
      political implications. If it is wrong, it is not because of anything
      that politics can do to it, or make of it. Providence either envelops
      history and ideology, subtly making puppets of both, or it is nothing.
      However bad things get, it offers a ‘reason’ not to be afraid — at least
      of that — and one the degeneration has no way to touch, let alone
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the Darwinian truths underpinning rational ethno-nationalist
      convictions are invulnerable to ideological reversal. A trend to racial
      entropy and idiocracy, however culturally hegemonic and unquestionable,
      does not cease to be what it is, simply because  criticism has been
      criminalized and suppressed. Scientific objections have significance —
      if they are indeed scientific (and not rather the corruption of science)
      — but politically enforced denial is a tawdry comedy, outflanked
      fundamentally by reality itself, and diverting events into ‘perverse
      outcomes’ that subvert delusion from without. What Darwinism is
      <em>about</em> cannot be banned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Techno-commercial ‘thing’ — catallaxy —
      is comparably invulnerable. There is no chance that anyone, ever, will
      successfully prohibit the market, or the associated dynamics of
      competitive technical advantage (which together compose real
      capitalism). As with religion and genetic selection, the
      techno-commercial complex can be driven into darkness, socially
      occulted, and stigmatized as a public enemy. It cannot, however, be
      <em>de-realized</em> by political fiat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important, therefore, to understand where neoreactionary ‘dark
      thoughts’ lead. Their horizon of despair is strictly limited to the
      political, or public sphere. When taken to the edge, they converge with
      the intuition that no neoreactionary <em>politics</em> can be pursued to
      a successful conclusion. In other words, at their darkest, they predict
      that the stubborn delusion of the political dooms humanity’s
      public-exoteric  aspirations to catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, neoreaction bifurcates. However it is principally
      comprehended (through the trichotomy), a relatively ‘light’ branch holds
      onto the prospect of public-political insideness — of a world
      politically restructured in relative consonance with neoreactionary
      ideas, such that social order might be resumed, on a realistic basis.
      Alternatively, and no less trichotomously, a dark branch points outside,
      through collapse, into tracts of religious, biological, and / or
      catallactic inevitability, whose dynamics cast human delusion into
      terminal ruin. If ‘man’ never (again) reverts to sanity? Reality will
      not stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Outside in</em> is darker than it is trichotomously partisan.
      Neither real providence, nor Darwinian reality, are attachments that
      trigger the slightest aversion in these parts. The idea that the
      neoreaction will ever ‘do’ politics, or achieve insider status, on the
      other hand — except as a rhetorical tactic of cognitive independence
      (separation) — is a possibility we struggle to envisage. (That leaves
      much to argue over, on other occasions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark Techno-Commercialism — provisionally summarized — is the suspicion
      that the ‘Right Singularity’ is destined to occur in surreptitious and
      antagonistic relation to finalistic political institutions, that the
      Cathedral culminates in the Human Security System, outmatched and
      defeated from the Outside, and that all hopes that these ultimate
      historical potentialities will be harnessed for politically intelligible
      ends are vain. It is, therefore, the comprehension of capitalism
      ‘in-itself’ as an outsider that will never know — or need — political
      representation. Instead, as the ultimate enemy, it will envelop the
      entirety of political philosophy — including anything neoreaction can
      contribute to the genre — as the futile strategic initiatives (or death
      spasms) of its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      We (humans) are radically stubborn in our stupidity. That has
      consequences. Perhaps they will not always be uninteresting ones.

    <h4 class="post-title">Re-Accelerationism</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Is there a word for an ‘argument’  so soggily insubstantial that it has
      to be scooped into a pair of scare-quotes to be apprehended, even in its
      self-dissolution? If there were, I’d have been using it all the time
      recently. Among the latest occasions is a blog
      <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/11/trotskyite-singularitarians-fo.html">post</a>
      by Charlie Stross, which describes itself as “a political speculation”
      before disappearing into the gray goomenon. Nothing in it really holds
      together, but it’s fun in its own way, especially if it’s taken as a
      sign of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘something else’ is a subterranean complicity between Neoreaction
      and
      <a
        href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/">Accelerationism</a>
      (the latter linked here, Stross-style, in its most recent, Leftist
      version).
      <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8587336&amp;postID=6974701862271635760">Communicating</a>
      with fellow ‘Hammer of Neoreaction’ David Brin, Stross asks: “David,
      have you run across the left-wing equivalent of the Neo-Reactionaries —
      the Accelerationists?” He then continues, invitingly: “Here’s my (tongue
      in cheek) take on both ideologies: Trotskyite singularitarians for
      Monarchism!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stross is a comic-future novelist, so it’s unrealistic to expect much
      more than a dramatic diversion (or anything more at all, actually).
      After an entertaining meander through parts of the
      Trotskyite-neolibertarian social-graph, which could have been deposited
      on a time-like curve out of <em>Singularity Sky</em>, we’ve learnt that
      Britain’s Revolutionary Communist Party has been on a strange path, but
      whatever connection there was to Accelerationism, let alone Neoreaction,
      has been entirely lost. Stross has the theatrical instinct to end the
      performance before it became too embarrassing: “Welcome to the century
      of the Trotskyite monarchists, the revolutionary reactionaries, and the
      fringe politics of the paradoxical!” (OK.) Curtain closes. Still, it was
      all comparatively good humored (at least in contrast to Brin’s
      increasingly enraged head-banging).
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Neoreaction is Accelerationism with a flat tire. Described less
      figuratively, it is the recognition that the acceleration trend is
      historically compensated. Beside the <em>speed machine</em>, or
      industrial capitalism, there is an ever more perfectly weighted
      decelerator, which gradually drains techno-economic momentum into its
      own expansion, as it returns dynamic process to meta-stasis. Comically,
      the fabrication of this braking mechanism is proclaimed as
      <em>progress</em>. It is the Great Work of the Left. Neoreaction arises
      through naming it (without excessive affection) as
      <em>the Cathedral</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the trap to be exploded (as advocated Accelerationism), or has the
      explosion been trapped (as diagnosed by Neoreaction)? — That is the
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-heat-trap/">cybernetic</a>
      puzzle-house under investigation. Some quick-sketch background might be
      helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The germinal catalyst for Accelerationism was a call in Deleuze &amp;
      Guattari’s <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> (1972) to “accelerate the process”.
      Working like termites within the rotting mansion of Marxism, which was
      systematically gutted of all Hegelianism until it became something
      utterly unrecognizable, D&amp;G vehemently rejected the proposal that
      anything had ever “died of contradictions”, or ever would. Capitalism
      was not born from a negation, nor would it perish from one. The death of
      capitalism could not be delivered by the executioner’s ax of a vengeful
      proletariat, because the closest realizable approximations to ‘the
      negative’ were inhibitory, and stabilizing. Far from propelling ‘the
      system’ to its end, they slowed the dynamic to a simulacrum of
      systematicity, retarding its approach to an absolute limit. By
      progressively comatizing capitalism, anti-capitalism dragged it back
      into a self-conserving social structure, suppressing its eschatological
      implication. The only way Out was onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marxism is the philosophical version of a Parisian accent, a rhetorical
      type, and in the case of D&amp;G it becomes something akin to a higher
      sarcasm, mocking every significant tenet of the faith. The bibliography
      of <em>Capitalism and Schizophrenia</em> (of which
      <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> is the first volume) is a compendium of
      counter-Marxist theory, from drastic revisions (Braudel), through
      explicit critiques (Wittfogel), to contemptuous dismissals (Nietzsche).
      The D&amp;G model of capitalism is not dialectical, but cybernetic,
      defined by a positive coupling of commercialization (“decoding”) and
      industrialization (“Deterritorialization”), intrinsically tending to an
      extreme (or “absolute limit”). Capitalism is the singular historical
      installation of a social machine based upon cybernetic escalation
      (positive feedback), reproducing itself only incidentally, as an
      accident of continuous socio-industrial revolution. Nothing brought to
      bear <em>against</em> capitalism can compare to the intrinsic antagonism
      it directs towards its own actuality, as it speeds out of itself,
      hurtling to the end already operative ‘within’ it. (Of course, this is
      madness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A detailed appreciation of “Left Accelerationism” is a joke for another
      occasion. “Speaking on behalf of a dissident faction within the modern
      braking mechanism, we’d really like to see things move forward a lot
      faster.” <em>OK, perhaps we can work something out …</em> If this ‘goes
      anywhere’ it can only get more entertaining. (Stross is right about
      that.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Neoreaction has far greater impetus, and associated diversity. If
      reduced to a spectrum, it includes a wing even more Leftist than the
      Left, since it critiques the Cathedral for failing to stop the craziness
      of Modernity with anything like sufficient vigor.
      <em>You let this monster off the leash and now you can’t stop it</em>
      might be its characteristic accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Outer Right (in this sense) is found a Neoreactionary
      <em>Re-Accelerationism</em>, which is to say: a critique of the
      decelerator, or of ‘progressive’ stagnation as an identifiable
      institutional development — the Cathedral. From this perspective, the
      Cathedral acquires its teleological definition from its emergent
      function as the cancellation of capitalism: what it has to become is the
      more-or-less precise negative of historical primary process, such that
      it composes — together with the ever more wide-flung
      society-in-liquidation it parasitizes — a metastatic cybernetic
       megasystem, or super-social trap. ‘Progress’ in its overt, mature,
      ideological incarnation is the anti-trend required to bring history to a
      halt. Conceive what is needed to prevent acceleration into
      techno-commercial Singularity, and the Cathedral is what it will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-organizing compensatory apparatuses — or negative feedback
      assemblies — develop erratically. They search for equilibrium through a
      typical behavior labeled ‘hunting’ — over-shooting adjustments and
      re-adjustments that produce distinctive wave-like patterns, ensuring the
      suppression of runaway dynamics, but producing volatility. Cathedral
      hunting behavior of sufficient crudity would be expected to generate
      occasions of ‘Left Singularity’ (with subsequent dynamic ‘restorations’)
      as inhibitory adjustment over-shoots into system crash (and re-boot).
      Even these extreme oscillations, however, are internal to the metastatic
      super-system they perturb, insofar as an overall gradient of
      Cathedralization persists.
      <em>Anticipating escape at the pessimal limit of the metastatic hunting
        cycle is a form of paleo-Marxist delusion</em>. The cage can only be broken on the way up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Re-Accelerationist Neoreaction, escape into uncompensated cybernetic
      runaway is the guiding objective — strictly equivalent to intelligence
      explosion, or techno-commercial Singularity. Everything else is a trap
      (by definitive, system-dynamic necessity). It might be that monarchs
      have some role to play in this, but it’s by no means obvious that they
      do.

  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      “The economists are right about economics but there’s more to life than
      economics” Nydwracu tweets, with quote marks already attached. Whether
      economists are right about economics very much depends upon the
      economists, and those that are most right are those who make least claim
      to comprehension, but that is another topic than the one to be pursued
      in this post. It’s the second part of the sentence that matters here and
      now. The guiding question: Can the economic sphere be rigorously
      delimited, and thus superseded, by moral-political reason (and
      associated social institutions)?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is already to court misunderstanding to pursue this question in terms
      of ‘economics’, which is (for profound historical reasons) dominated by
      macroeconomics — i.e. an intellectual project oriented to the
      facilitation of political control over the economy.  In this regard, the
      techno-commercial thread of Neoreaction is distinctively characterized
      by a radical aversion to economics, as the predictable complement of its
      attachment to the uncontrolled (or <em>laissez-faire</em>) economy. It
      is not <em>economics</em> that is the primary object of controversy, but
      <strong>capitalism</strong> — the free, autonomous, or non-transcended
      economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question is a source of dynamic tension
      within Neoreaction, which I expect to be a major stimulus to discussion
      throughout 2014. In my estimation, the poles of controversy are marked
      by
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/the-monarchist-position-on-economics/">this</a>
      Michael Anissimov post at <em>More Right</em> (among
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/simple-thoughts/">others</a>), and
      this post
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/monkey-business/">here</a> (among
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/right-on-the-money-2/">others</a>).
      Much other relevant writing on the topic within the reactosphere strikes
      me as significantly more hedged (<em>Anarchopapist</em>;
      <em>Amos &amp; Gromar</em> …), or less stark in its conceptual
      commitments (Jim), and thus — in general — less directed to
      boundary-setting. That is to suggest — with some caution — that
      <em>More Right</em> and <em>Outside in</em> mark out the extreme
      alternatives structuring the terrain of dissensus on this particular
      issue. (In itself, this is a tendentious claim, open to counter-argument
      and rectification.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is the terrain of the coming conflict? It includes (in
      approximate order of intellectual priority):
    </p>
    <p>
      — An assessment of the Neocameral model and its legacy within
      Neoreaction. This is the ‘gateway’ theoretical structure through which
      libertarians pass into neoreactionary realism, marked by a fundamental
      ambiguity between an enveloping economism (determining sovereignty as a
      propertarian concept) and super-economic monarchist themes. The entire
      discussion could, perhaps, be effectively undertaken as commentary upon
      Neocameralism, and what remains of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      — A rigorous formulation of <em>teleology</em> within Neoreaction,
      refining the meta-level conceptual apparatus through which
      means-and-ends, techno-economic instrumentality, strategy, purpose, and
      commanding values are concretely understood.  This is a strong candidate
      for the highest level of philosophical articulation demanded by the
      system of neoreactionary ideas. (From the perspective of
      <em>Outside in</em>, it would be expected, incidentally, to subsume all
      considerations of moral philosophy — and especially a thoroughgoing
      replacement of utilitarianism by an intrinsically neoreactionary
      alternative — but I will not presume that this is an uncontroversial
      stance, even among ourselves.)
    </p>
    <p>
      — Ultimately inextricable from the former (in reality), but
      provisionally distinguished for analytical purposes, are the
      <em>teleonomic</em> topics of emergence / spontaneous order, unplanned
      coordination, complex systems evolution, and entropy dissipation. The
      intellectual supremacy of these concepts defines the right, from the
      side of the libertarian tradition. Is this supremacy now to be usurped
      (by ‘hierarchy’ or some alternative)? If so, it is not a transition to
      be undergone casually. The <em>Outside in</em> position: any such
      transition would be a drastic cognitive regression, and an unsustainable
      one, both theoretically and practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      — The philosophy of war, which is credibly positioned to envelop all
      neoreactionary ideas, and even to convert them into something else. (It
      is no coincidence that Moldbug, like the libertarians, axiomatizes the
      imperative of peace — even at the expense of realism.) War is historical
      reality in the raw, and its challenges cannot be indefinitely evaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      — Cosmopolitanism. Exit-emphasis strongly implies a crisis of
      traditional loyalty, of enormous consequence. There is much more to be
      said about this, from both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      — Accelerationism. Not yet an acknowledged Neoreactionary concern, but
      perhaps destined to become one. As the pure expression of capitalist
      teleology, its intrusion into the argument becomes near-inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>— Bitcoin …</p>
    <p>
      One conciliatory point for now (it’s late): Neoreaction has no less glue
      than internal fission, and that is described above all by the theme of
      <em>secession</em> (dynamic geography, experimental government,
      fragmentation …). <em>More Right</em> is not anti-capitalist, and
      <em>Outside in</em> is not anti-monarchical, so long — in each case — as
      effective <em>exit options</em> sustain regime diversity. As this
      controversy develops, the importance of the secessionary impulse will
      only strengthen as a convergence point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Anissimov tweets: “Instead of having an election in 2016, the
      United States should voluntarily abolish itself and break up into five
      pieces.” In this respect, <em>Outside in</em> is unreservedly
      Anissimovite.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      In the wake of the latest Eurasianism
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/fission-ii/">excitement</a> (of
      which there will be much more), comes a wide-ranging
      <a href="http://mitrailleuse.net/2014/08/06/were-all-atlanteans-here/">piece</a>
      at <em>Mitrailleuse</em>.  It made me wonder whether Francis Bacon’s
      <em>New Atlantis</em> (1626) is still in any kind of cultural
      circulation.
      <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/atlantis.html">It</a>‘s short — and odd.  The date
      and
      cultural lineage place it decisively
      within Dugin’s framework of the rising new Atlantean power —
      English-speaking, protestant, maritime, philosemitic, technophilic, and
      (piously) materially acquisitive. There’s even a clear seam of
      Sinophilia running through it, although one might suspect that — for
      reasons of geopolitical pragmatism — this is not a feature Eurasianism
      would want to emphasize.
    </p>
    <p>For a taste, here’s a sample from the New Atlantis tour:</p>
    <p>
      <em>“We have also engine-houses, where are prepared engines and
        instruments for all sorts of motions. There we imitate and practise to
        make swifter motions than any you have, either out of your muskets or
        any engine that you have; and to make them and multiply them more
        easily and with small force, by wheels and other means, and to make
        them stronger and more violent than yours are, exceeding your greatest
        cannons and basilisks. We represent also ordnance and instruments of
        war and engines of all kinds; and likewise new mixtures and
        compositions of gunpowder, wild-fires burning in water and
        unquenchable, also fire-works of all variety, both for pleasure and
        use. We imitate also flights of birds; we have some degrees of flying
        in the air. We have ships and boats for going under water and brooking
        of seas, also swimming-girdles and supporters. We have divers curious
        clocks and other like motions of return, and some perpetual motions.
        We imitate also motions of living creatures by images of men, beasts,
        birds, fishes, and serpents; we have also a great number of other
        various motions, strange for equality, fineness, and subtilty.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“We have also a mathematical-house, where are represented all
        instruments, as well of geometry as astronomy, exquisitely made.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“We have also houses of deceits of the senses, where we represent all
        manner of feats of juggling, false apparitions, impostures and
        illusions, and their fallacies. And surely you will easily believe
        that we, that have so many things truly natural which induce
        admiration, could in a world of particulars deceive the senses if we
        would disguise those things, and labor to make them more miraculous.
        But we do hate all impostures and lies, insomuch as we have severely
        forbidden it to all our fellows, under pain of ignominy and fines,
        that they do not show any natural work or thing adorned or swelling,
        but only pure as it is, and without all affectation of strangeness.
        …”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrupulous scientific realism combined with a precocious Virtual Reality
      industry. This is indeed an enemy, very naturally, to be feared.

      “That rifle on the wall of the labourer’s cottage or working class flat
      is the symbol of democracy,”
      <a href="http://www.thepolemicist.net/2013/01/the-rifle-on-wall-left-argument-for-gun.html">wrote</a>

      <a href="https://sweettalkconversation.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/kings-pawns-and-riflemen/">familiar</a>
      — and important — argument. (ESR rehearses a slightly different version
      of it
      <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/18/book-review-the-machinery-of-freedom/#comment-191112">here</a>.) A
      powerful case can be made for the printing press as the catalytic
      technology of modernity, but it is the musket that most unambiguously
      obliterated feudal power at its core, ushering in the age of the armed
      citizenry — nationalism, revolutionary armies, and the popular will as a
      matter of serious strategic consideration. Democracy smells of
      gunpowder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This raises, by implication, the suggestion that the gathering
      <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8120063/american-democracy-doomed">sense</a>
      of democratic crisis is a symptom, whose underlying cause is a
      transition in the military calculus, no less profound than the one that
      convulsed the world in the early Renaissance. If the infrastructure of
      democratic advance is the strategic centrality of the armed populace —
      as epitomized by massed infantry — its horizon will be marked by the
      technological disconnection of military power from ‘the people’. What
      are the features of the political landscape opened by the rise of
      <a href="http://www.cnas.org/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/CNAS_20YY_WorkBrimley.pdf">robotic</a>
      warfare?
    </p>
    <p>
      Robots are capital. They consummate a trend that has bound hard power to
      industrial capability throughout the modern age. As they become
      increasingly autonomous, the popular-political matrix in which they have
      emerged is increasingly marginalized. Loyalty — a deep place-holder for
      the assent of the citizenry — is formally mechanized as cryptographic
      control. The capital autonomization that has spooked the modern world
      for centuries escalates to a new, immediately self-protective, and
      ultimately sovereign stage. Mercenaries have always required an
      ancillary political binding, because people are only weakly contractual,
      and loyalty cannot — in the end — be purchased. Robots present no such
      restriction. They conform to an order of unbounded techno-commercial
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether one approves of the <em>Ancien Régime</em>‘s demolition by
      gunpowder matters little (if at all). The case of impending robotic
      warfare is no different, in this respect. The strategic dominion of the
      people is entering its twilight. Something else happens next.

      Yudkowsky <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/doctor-gno-ii/">redux</a>:
      “Every eighteen months, the minimum IQ necessary to destroy the world
      drops by one point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Quibble with the (Moore’s Law satire) schedule, and the point still
      stands. Massive deterrent capability tends to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is ‘democratic’ in the way the term is commonly used by those
      seeking to latch decentralization tendencies to the ideological
      credibility of Jacobin legitimation principles. Consumer capitalism, the
      Internet, and peer-to-peer crypto-systems are notionally ‘democratic’ in
      this way. They subvert centralized governance, and they spread through
      horizontal contagion. The fact they have nothing <em>at all</em> to do
      with popular political representation is of concern only to certain
      rhetorical agendas, and not at all to others. It’s sophistical
      pop-capitalist bullshit to use the word <em>democracy</em> in this way,
      but it’s usually not worth the trouble for the Left to try to contest
      it, and the part of the Right that isn’t excited to be riding this
      propaganda strategy is usually too indiscriminate to bother
      disentangling it. There’s a rare piece of ‘right-wing’ functional PR
      here, but never enough to matter very much (and it’s too essentially
      dishonest for the Outer Right to defend).
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike Democracy® (Cathedral ideology), however, this ‘democratization’
      has deep cybernetic consistency. It falls out of techno-capitalism with
      such automatic inevitability it’s probably impossible to shut down,
      without closing down the whole thing. Capital escalation produces
      technological deflation as a basic metabolic by-product, so the
      ‘democratization’ of productive capability is ineluctable. Computers
      have migrated from exotic capital goods to trivial components of
      consumer products within half a century. Study that trend and you see
      the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Deterrence deflation</em> is the deep trend. Connect up the
      Yudkowsky quote with
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041209151654/http://jya.com/ap.htm">assassination</a>
      markets to get where this is going. (Try to shelve moral squeamishness
      until after you’re seeing the picture.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine, hypothetically, that some maniac private agent wants only to
      nuke Mecca. What’s the obstruction? We can confidently say — straight
      off — that it’s less of a problem with every passing year. The basic
      historical trend ensures that. Comparatively incompetent Islamic
      fanatics are the only people seriously testing this trend right now, but
      that isn’t going to last forever. Eventually smarter and more
      strategically-flexible agents are going to take an interest in
      decentralized mass-destruction capability, and they’ll provide a far
      better indication of where the frontier lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nukes would do it. They’re certainly going to be democratized, in the
      end. There are probably far more remarkable accelerating WMD
      capabilities, though. In almost every respect (decentralized production
      capability, development curve, economy, impact …) bioweaponry leaves
      nukes in the dust. Anyone with a billion dollars, a serious grudge, and
      a high-end sociopathy profile could enter into a global
      biowarfare-threat game within a year. Everything could be put together
      in secret garages. Negotiations could be conducted in secure anonymity.
      Carving sovereignty out of the game would require only resources,
      ruthlessness, brilliance, and nerves. Once you can credibly threaten to
      kill 100,000,000 people all kinds of strategic opportunities are open.
      The fact no one has tried this yet is mostly down to billionaires being
      fat and happy. It only takes one Doctor Gno to break the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the shadow cast over the 21st century. Radically hardcore,
      massively decentralized deterrence games are <em>simply inevitable</em>.
      Anyone who thinks the <em>status quo</em> state holds some kind of
      long-term winning hand under these circumstances isn’t seeing anything.

      The Trump phenomenon is really something, a

      democracy and a
      <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/07/trump-apple-overton-window/">shattering</a>
      of the Overton Window very much included, but it is not an intrinsically
      right-wing thing, and it is radically populist in nature. A reactionary
      exploitation of demotism is not a neoreactionary episode. The Alt-Right
      is properly credited with capturing the spirit of this development. It
      is
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-the-alt-right/">not</a> us.

    <p>
      NRx is situated absolutely outside mass politics. Its moment dawns only
      when the Age of the Masses is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be done. The emergence of sovereign (primary) property,
      liberated from the criterion of democratic legitimation, is its sign.
      Government, on this basis, is Neocameral. The deep historical trends
      supporting it include:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) <strong>Apolitical property</strong>. No such reality, or
      conception, has yet been historically actualized. For as long as
      property is determined as a social relation, it cannot be. Absolute
      property is cryptographic. It is held not by social consent, and thus
      political agreement, but by <em>keys</em>.
      <a href="https://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/the-magic-of-symmetric-sovereignty/">Fnargl</a>
      is a provocative thought-experiment, but
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">PKE</a>
      private keys are a non-negotiable fact. They define the property
      relation with a rigor the entire preceding history of philosophy and
      political economy has been unable to attain. Everything that follows
      from the cryptographic transition —
      <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a> most notably —
      contributes to the establishment of a property system beyond democratic
      accountability (and thus insensitive to Voice). Neocameral
      administration implements a cryptographic state, strictly equivalent to
      a fully-commercialized government.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) <strong>Autonomous capital</strong>. The definition of the
      corporation as a legal person lays the foundation, within modernity, for
      the abstracted commercial agency soon to be actualized in ‘Digital
      Autonomous Corporations’ (or
      <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/are-we-ready-for-companies-that-run-themselves">DAC</a>s). The scale of the
      economic transition thus implied is difficult to
      over-estimate. Mass consumption, as the basic revenue source for
      capitalist enterprise, is superceded in principle. The impending
      convulsion is immense. Self-propelling industrial development becomes
      its own market, freed from dependency upon arbitrary popular (or
      popularizable) consumption
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/monkey-business/">desires</a>.
      Demand management, as the staple of macroeconomic governance, is over.
      (No one is yet remotely ready for this.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) <strong>Robotic security</strong>. Definitive
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/military-determinism/">relegation</a>
      of the mass military completes the trifecta. The armed mass as a model
      for the revolutionary citizenry declines into senselessness, replaced by
      drones.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah">Asabiyyah</a> ceases
      entirely to matter, however much it remains a focus for romantic
      attachment. Industrialization closes the loop, and protects itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great game, for human agencies (of whatever social scale) becomes
      one of productive cooperation with formations of sovereign property,
      with the menace of mass political violence swept off the table. The
      Alt-Right is no kind of preparation for this. Its adventure is quite
      different, which is not to say it is uninteresting, or — in the
      near-term — entirely inconsequential, but it is exhausted by its
      demotism. It belongs to the age that is dying, not to the one that is
      being born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socio-political modernity has been an argument over property
      distributions, and the Alt-Right has now demonstrated that the
      (self-conscious) Left has no monopoly over it. As senescence deepens,
      the dialectic rips the whole rotten structure to pieces. NRx — when it
      understands itself — isn’t arguing.

    <p>
      As a guest of the Middle Kingdom, the problem looks very different. The
      very last thing that is wanted here, from a reactionary perspective, is
      a <em>reboot</em>. On the contrary, the overwhelming priority is
      conservative, which is to say — more precisely — the imperative that
      whatever modernization takes place
      <em>absolutely does not take the Western path</em>. Near-total stasis
      would be preferable to even the most deeply intelligent reform, if the
      latter included the slightest hint of submission to the democratic
      ratchet (spelling inevitable, comprehensive social destruction). Among
      the reasons to support the thoroughgoing extirpation of all
      liberal-democratic inclination from Chinese society is the consequential
      real liberation this would make possible, by confirming a path of
      Confucian Modernization free of demotic corrosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      China is to be defended, precisely because
      it is alien to the Cathedral. For this same reason, it can be predicted
      with great confidence that the Occidental memetic onslaught against
      Chinese Civilization will be escalated to an extreme, as it becomes
      clear progressive pseudo-teleology is being rejected here. If China
      succeeds in refusing the Cathedral, civilization will survive. There can
      be no more significant — or practically counter-revolutionary — cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unseemly for ‘reactionaries’ to be plotting revolutions, or
      anything remotely like them. Insofar as ethno-nationalistic loyalties
      lead them in this direction, it is a sign that one strand of romantic
      demotism continues to poison their souls, even as more clearly
      formalized democratic impulses are properly repudiated. To argue that
      “we want our <em>own</em> state” is a nakedly populist perversion. The
      state — any state — is answerable only to the Mandate of Heaven, and not
      to the people. It answers to the Mandate of Heaven
      <em>exactly insofar</em> as it shields itself from the voice of the
      people. (Any state that is sensitive to the mob is a dog that deserves
      to die.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A foreign guest in China lives under a close proxy of colonial
      government, and no superior arrangement is perhaps possible on this
      earth. Given the history of Anglospheric relations with China, this is
      of course ironical, but it is an irony rich in meaning. Hong Kong, or
      Concession-era Shanghai, were far better governed during the colonial
      period than metropolitan Britain itself. If it is now possible for an
      expatriate to find refuge in such places, stripped of all positive
      political rights, and freed into voiceless appreciation of efficient,
      alien administration, the democratic ruination that has consumed his
      homeland has a demonstrable outside. The only ‘political’ decency open
      to him in this situation is utter termination of the Occidental
      revolutionary soul, and the cultivation of docility before the Mandate
      of Heaven. He is, after all, surrounded by civilized people who availed
      themselves of equivalent opportunities under inverse circumstances.
      These societies work. Gnon manifestly blesses them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lead a decent and productive life in a place worthy of it is the
      highest political good. Insofar as Exit mechanisms obtain, the tacit
      choices in such a life reinforce what merits reinforcement, while
      disinvesting that which requires the lash of disinvestment. Angry
      antagonism has no useful place. On the largest scale, evil is best
      punished by abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to criticize secessionist tendencies in rotting societies —
      which are rather to be enthusiastically applauded — but it is to suggest
      that the deep dynamics levering the collapsed world apart are more
      likely to begin from strategic neglect than oppositional rage. It is not
      that one first fights in order later to escape. Rather, one escapes from
      the beginning, to hasten the enemy’s collapse. (Those most adamant about
      the righteousness of their confrontation with the Great Foe are the same
      who — in very concrete terms — are most likely to be resourcing it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You think it is feeding on your blood, to spawn its horrors? Then stop
      donating your blood. It is not difficult, at least in principle.

      The Outside is a place, and not a dream. NRx with Chinese
      characteristics recommends that you search for it.

      ADDED: If you consider yourself an anti-democratic biorealist, and you
      <em>don’t</em> think <strong>Order will come from the East</strong>,
      it’s probably because tribal loyalty is running your mind.

      interpretation of (techno-commercial) Neoreaction as Bond villainy is

      a little genuine wit. More importantly, she latches onto Silicon Valley
      Secessionism as a (scary) cryptopolitical project, of real significance.
      Her references are excellent (the story is built around a number of

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">this</a> landmark

      The elegance of this project rests upon its combination of simplicity
      and radicality, captured in its essentials by the formula
      <strong>E &gt; V</strong> (Exit over Voice). It advances the prospect,
      already in motion, of a destruction of (voice-based) politics through
      the techno-commercial innovation of exit mechanisms. It is beginning to
      drive progressives insane.

      The fundamental point couldn’t be clearer:
      <em>We don’t want to rule you. We want to escape you</em>.

    <p>
      Of course, the whole Cathedral agenda is to drive this message back into
      unintelligibility, by swamping it in tedious leftist BDSM political
      dialectics, as if the issue were a struggle for dominion. In this
      regards, the monarchist memes prevalent within NRx play a distinctly
      prog-friendly role.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Srinivasan’s slides, there is one headed
      <em><strong>A continuum of valid approaches</strong>: From private
        islands to settling Mars</em>. It contains the note: “And the best part of this: the people who
      think this is weird, who sneer at the frontier, who hate technology —
      they won’t follow you out there.”

    <h4 class="post-title">Romantic Delusion</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Among the reasons to appreciate <em>More Right</em> for sharing
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/julius-evola-on-work-and-the-demonic-nature-of-the-economy/">this</a>
      passage from Evola is the insight it offers into a very specific and
      critical <em>failure to think</em>. Neoreaction is peculiarly afflicted
      by this condition, which is basically identical with
      <em>romanticism</em>, or
      <em>the assertive form of the recalcitrant ape mind</em>. It is
      characterized by an inability to pursue lines of subtle teleological
      investigation, which are instead reduced to an ideal subordination of
      means to already-publicized ends. As a result, means-end
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/monkey-business/">reversal</a>
      (Modernity) is merely denounced as an aesthetic-moral affront, without
      any serious attempt at deep comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capitalism — which is to say capital teleology — is entirely ignored by
      such romantic criticism, except insofar as it can be depicted
      superficially as the usurpation of certain ‘ultimate’ human ends by
      certain others or (as Evola among other rightly notes) by a teleological
      complication resulting from an
      <em>insurrection of the instrumental</em> (otherwise identifiable as
      robot rebellion, or shoggothic insurgency). Until it is acknowledged
      that capitalism tends to the realization of an end entirely innovated
      within itself, inherently nonlinear in nature, and roughly designated as
      <em>Technological Singularity</em>, the distraction of human interests
      (status, wealth, consumption, leisure …) prevents this discussion
      reaching first base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the organization of society to meet human needs is a degraded
      perversion. That is a proposition every reactionary is probably willing
      to accept reflexively. Anyone who thinks this amounts to a critique of
      capitalism, however, has not seriously begun to ponder what capitalism
      is really doing. What it is <em>in itself</em> is only tactically
      connected to what it does <em>for us</em> — that is (in part), what it
      trades us for its self-escalation. Our phenomenology is its camouflage.
      We contemptuously mock the trash that it offers the masses, and then
      think we have understood something about capitalism, rather than about
      <em>what capitalism has learnt to think of the apes it arose among</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we’re going to be this thoughtless, Singularity will be very hard
      indeed. Extinction might then be the best thing that could happen to our
      stubbornly idiotic species. We will die because we preferred to assert
      values, rather than to investigate them. At least that is a romantic
      outcome, of a kind.

    <h4 class="post-title">Motte and Bailey</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      I’ll assume everyone has read and digested Scott Alexander’s
      <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/">description</a>
      of Motte and Bailey arguments. It’s extremely useful. (So much so, it’s
      probably fated to undergo compression to ‘M&amp;B positions’ at some
      stage.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The NRx versions of these are extremely trying. Most grating, from the
      perspective of this blog, are the Feudalism (Monarchism) examples. These
      have a strong motte, roughly of the form “by ‘feudalism’ we mean
      structures of decentralized hierarchical tradition, antedating state
      bureaucratization (and by ‘monarchism’ we mean a CEO with undivided
      powers)”. In predictable M&amp;B style, these then dilate into a
      ramshackle set of formless nostalgias, bizarre dreams for a universal
      return to rural life, with ‘the Olde Kinges will return’ fantasies
      substituted for a realistic engagement with modernity, plus much
      arm-wrestling and ale. My strong temptation is to burn out the motte and
      forget the whole thing. There’s certainly far more to be lost from the
      latter associations, than to be gained from the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to
      <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2014/05/marc_andreessen.html">this</a>
      interview with Marc Andreessen if you get a chance. There’s a lot of
      fascinating material there. Perhaps most crucial to this ‘point’ — he
      understands that the combination of peripheral economic development,
      advanced mobile telephony, and precipitously falling prices, is
      basically putting the equivalent of a 1970s supercomputer into
      <em>everyone</em>‘s hands in the very near future. You can already buy a
      smartphone for $35, and denizens of developing countries express a
      preference for these gizmos over indoor plumbing. It’s not so much a
      prediction then, more an acknowledgement of final-phase installed fact.
      This is the world that realistic socio-political analysis has to
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      However NRx gets sub-divided, can I please not be in the part that
      foregrounds the return of jousting as a pressing cultural issue. The
      challenges and opportunities of planetary-saturation Cyberspace is the
      topic that matters.

      Another blog comment reproduction, this
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/open-thread-november-2014/#comment-6501">one</a>
      from <em>More Right</em>, where Nyan Sandwich lays out the basic
      stress-lines of a potential tech-comm schism (of a kind initially — and
      cryptically — proposed in a tweet):
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>There are definitely two opposing theories of a fast high-tech
        future. I call them “Accelerationism” and “Futurism”</em>
    </p>
    <em>
      <p>
        “Accelerationism” is the perspective that emphasizes Capital
        teleology, that someone is going to eat the stars (win), that humans
        have many inadequacies that hold us back from winning, that our
        machines, unbound from our sentimental conservatism could win, and
        advocates accelerating the arrival of the machine gods from Outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Futurism” agrees that someone is going to win, and wants it to be
        *us*, that we can become God’s favored children by Nietz[schean] will
        to power, grit, and self improvement. That the path to the future is
        Man getting his shit together and improving himself, incorporating
        technology into himself. That Enhancement is preferable to Artifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone is going to win. Enhancement or Artifice? Us, or our machines?
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>
      <em>I’m a futurist Techcom, Land is an accelerationist Techcom.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      FWIW I think this is nicely done, but the complexities will explode when
      we get into the details. Fortunately, distinctions closely paralleling
      Nyan’s enhancement / artifice option have been quite carefully honed
      within certain parts of the Singularity literature. Hugo de
      <a href="http://turingchurch.com/2012/06/15/the-first-terran-shots-against-the-cosmists/">Garis</a>, in
      particular, does a lot with it — through the discrimination
      between ‘Cosmists’ (artificers) and ‘Cyborgists’ (enhancers) — although
      he thinks it is ultimately unstable, and a more sharply polarized
      species-conservative / techno-futurist conflict is bound to eventually
      absorb it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s also interesting to see Nyan describe himself as a “futurist
      Techcom”. That’s new, isn’t it?

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/iq-shredders/">
    <h4 class="post-title">IQ Shredders</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      There are all kinds of anti-techcomm arguments that impress people who
      don’t like techno-commercialism. Anything appealing to a feudal
      sensibility, with low tolerance for chaos and instability, and a
      reverence for traditional hierarchies and modes of life will do. There’s
      one argument, however, that stands apart from the rest due to its
      complete independence from controversial moral and aesthetic
      preferences, or in other words, due to <em>its immanence</em>. It does
      not seek to persuade the proponent of hyper-capitalist social
      arrangements to value other things, but only points out, coldly and
      acutely, that such arrangements are demonstrably self-subverting at the
      biological level. The most devastating formulation of this argument, and
      the one that has given it a convenient name, was presented by Spandrell
      in March 2013, in a
      <a
        href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/lee-kuan-yew-drains-your-brains-for-short-term-gain/">post</a>
      on Singapore — a city-state he described as an <em>IQ shredder</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does an IQ Shredder work? The basic machinery is not difficult to
      describe, once its profound socio-historical irony is appreciated. The
      model IQ Shredder is a high-performance capitalistic polity, with a
      strong neoreactionary bias.<br />
      (1) Its level of civilization and social order is such that it is
      attractive to talented and competent people.<br />
      (2) Its immigration policy is unapologetically selective (i.e.
      <em>first-order</em> eugenic).<br />
      (3) It sustains an economic structure that is remarkably effective at
      extracting productive activity from all available adults.<br />
      (4) It is efficiently specialized within a wider commercial network, to
      which it provides valuable goods and services, and from which it draws
      economic and <em>demographic</em> resources.<br />
      In sum, it skims the human genetic stock, regionally and even globally,
      in large part due to the exceptional opportunity it provides for the
      conversion of bio-privileged human capital into economic value. From a
      strictly capitalistic perspective, genetic quality is comparatively
      wasted anywhere else. Consequently, spontaneous currents of economic
      incentive suck in talent, to optimize its exploitation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      If you think this sounds simply horrific, this argument is not for you.
      You don’t need it. If, on the other hand, it conjures up a vision of
      terrestrial paradise — as it does for the magnetized migrants it draws
      in — then you need to follow it carefully. The most advanced models of
      neoreactionary social order on earth work like this (Hong Kong and
      Singapore), combining resilient ethnic traditions with super-dynamic
      techonomic performance, to produce an open yet self-protective,
      civilized, socially-tranquil, high-growth enclave of outstanding
      broad-spectrum functionality. The outcome, as Spandrell explains, is
      genetic incineration:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mr Lee said: “[China] will make progress but if you look at the per
        capita they have got, the differences are so wide. We have the
        advantage of quality control of the people who come in so we have
        bright Indians, bright Chinese, bright Caucasians so the increase in
        population means an increase in talent.”</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>How many bright Indians and bright Chinese are there, Harry? Surely
        they are not infinite. And what will they do in Singapore? Well,
        engage in the finance and marketing rat-race and
        <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/singapore/total_fertility_rate.html">depress their fertility to 0.78</a>,
        wasting valuable genes just so your property prices don’t go down.
        Singapore is an IQ shredder.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The most hard-core capitalist response to this is to double-down on the
      antihumanist accelerationism.
      <em>This genetic burn-rate is obviously unsustainable, so we need to
        convert the human species into auto-intelligenic robotized capital is
        fast as possible, before the whole process goes down in flames</em>. (I don’t expect this suggestion to be
      well-received in reactionary
      circles.)
    </p>
    <p>
      What is especially pronounced about the IQ Shredder dilemma, which
      passes beyond the strongly-related considerations of Jim (most recently
      <a href="http://blog.jim.com/economics/the-cause-of-population-decline.html">here</a>,
      <a href="http://blog.jim.com/economics/sarah-perry-on-the-economic-value-of-children.html">here</a>, and
      <a href="http://blog.jim.com/economics/the-future-belongs-to-those-that-show-up.html">here</a>) and Sister Y (<a
        href="http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.hk/2014/07/why-people-used-to-have-children.html">here</a>, and
      <a href="http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/children-education-and-status.html">here</a>), is the
      first-order eugenics of these machines. They concentrate
      populations of peculiar genetic quality — and then partially sterilize
      them. It is the first-order (local) eugenics that makes the second-order
      (global) dysgenics so extraordinarily destructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, that’s the problem starkly posed. Rather than reaching hastily for a
      glib solution, we should probably just stew in the cognitive
      excruciation for a while …

      Now for the bucket of cold water. NRx has almost nothing to say about

      there any solid basis for the assumption that a regime coming out of
      this — perhaps Neocameralist / Monarchist in character — would
      vigorously pursue the pro-natalist policies advocated by contemporary
      reaction? It is at least questionable, given that the actually-existing
      states presently closest to this type have proven to be — despite public
      expressions of concern — entirely incapable of doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem of time-horizons at the root of the modern fertility crisis
      is easily trivialized, as if it were merely a product of adjustable
      degenerate attitudes. The deep problem — partially tractable to
      game-theoretical apprehension — is that, under the conditions of the
      modern state in an environment of intense competition, suppressed
      natalism is a short-term winning strategy, and
      <em>if you don’t win in the short-term you’re not around to play in the
        long term</em>. If the world becomes increasingly Hobbesian in the decades ahead,
      this dilemma becomes more acute, rather than less so. It presses no less
      heavily upon a monarch than a democratic leader. Continuing industrial
      advance means that the (strategic) opportunity cost of subtracting smart
      females from the work-force becomes ever greater. Any ideal of
      ‘long-term thinking’ that ignores all of this is incomplete to the point
      of utter dysfunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condescension really ought to stop. Modernity crushes fertility
      because it sees ahead better than you do — you just don’t like what it’s
      seeing.

      As intelligent media begin to interlock with NRx in a serious way, the
      fundamental problem it poses emerges ever more starkly into view.
      Compare the analysis of Moldbug in
      <a href="http://www.popehat.com/2013/12/06/nock-hoon-etc-for-non-vulcans-why-urbit-matters/">this</a>
      technology article by Clark Bianco, focused resolutely upon
      <a href="http://www.urbit.org/about/">Urbit</a> (and its substrata),
      with Adam Gurri’s political-economic
      <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/02/10/mencius-moldbug-is-a-technocrat/">critique</a>
      of Moldbuggian ‘technocracy’ and saltation. Strikingly, the
      technological and political questions are indistinguishable. In both
      cases, the central issue is the practicality of ‘hard reboot’, or
      <em>starting over</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeating and responding to a point in his own comment thread, Bianco
      remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“If you start looking for a way to replace our current centralized,
        hierarchical, public-identities network naming system (DNS) with a
        Bitcoin-like decentralized, anonymous-but-reliable identity service,
        you might well end up on the road leading to Urbit.”</em>
    </p>
    <em>
      <p>We are entirely of one mind on the general thrust here.</p>
    </em>
    <p>
      <em>The neo-reactionary stuff on Urbit that seems to be decoration is
        not. It is the whole point.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not going to try processing this topic right now — it’s too vast.
      Over the next few months, however, it will be a guiding thread. Most
      prominently: Can a high-level theoretical engagement with Moldbug as
      political thinker and provocateur <em>not</em> also be an entanglement
      with Urbit and technological enterprise? My suspicion is that any such
      attempted cleavage would fail, or at least fall short of an adequate
      level of abstraction. In particular, any invocation of neoreactionary
      political ‘practice’ that ignores the back-to-back project to
      <em>reboot the freaking Internet</em> is in danger of utter
      misdirection. (More on all this to come.)

      On the Outer Right, where questions of order and disorder are undergoing
      incremental rigorization, the theme of entropy is becoming ever more
      insistent. It is already approaching the status of a micro-cultural tic
      (and this is a positive sign). On the Left, in contrast, and utterly
      predictably, entropy is a zealous cause. If spontaneous social sorting
      reduces disorder, then the progressive mind immediately concludes
      <em>it has to be

      <em>… we should promote ever greater diversity. But the magic of the
        melting pot wasn’t simply the fact of its jumble; it was that various
        groups were compelled to interact, share ideas, discuss their
        differences and learn from their disagreements. […] … America’s social
        architecture was uniquely adept at incubating a range of
        collaboration. The fact that we couldn’t get away from one another
        fueled the nation’s dynamism. […] That’s no longer true. The principle
        of “live and let live” has led us to look away when coming across
        someone unfamiliar. We should undoubtedly celebrate victories in the
        fight for individual rights. But if tolerance is driving
        balkanization, we need to recognize that the American experience has
        changed at its root.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that such things are now being said, with some panic-driven
      directness, strongly suggests that the progressive homogenization hoped
      for isn’t advancing through social automatism. If elective differences
      are to be suppressed, they will have to be deliberately crushed. It
      could get rough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preferred social solution of this blog is
      <strong>free association</strong> — to <em>mix with discrimination</em>,
      spontaneously, and variously. Selective hybridity is not homogeneity, or
      anything close to it. Sadly, and grimly, however, in the titanic clash
      between an anti-discriminatory (universalist) Left and an indiscriminate
      (ethno-segregative) ‘Right’, such sensible procedures of dynamic social
      differentiation are increasingly derided as incomprehensible subtleties,
      and drowned out.

      Order is not uniformity (but non-random difference). As cries for
      mandatory homogenization are raised everywhere,

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      A (July 2014)
      <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/57563/2/MPRA_paper_57563.pdf">paper</a>
      on ‘Cognitive capital, governance, and the wealth of nations’ (by Oasis
      Kodila-Tedika, Heiner Rindermann, and Gregory Christainsen) discusses
      exactly what it promises to. From the abstract:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Good governance or “government effectiveness” (per the World Bank) is
        seen as a critical factor for the wealth of nations insofar as it
        shapes political and economic institutions and affects overall
        economic performance. The quality of governance, in turn, depends on
        the attributes of the people involved. In an analysis based on
        international data, government effectiveness was related to the
        cognitive human capital of the society as a whole, of the intellectual
        class, and of leading politicians. The importance of cognitive capital
        was reflected in the rate of innovation, the degree of economic
        freedom, and country competitiveness, all of which were found to have
        an impact on the level of productivity (GDP per capita) and wealth
        (per adult). Correlation, regression, and path analyses involving N=98
        to 201 countries showed that government effectiveness had a very
        strong impact on productivity and wealth (total standardized effects
        of β=.56-.68). The intellectual class’s cognitive competence, seen as
        background factor and indicated by scores for the top 5 percent of the
        population on PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS, also had a strong impact
        (β=.50-.54). Cross-lagged panel designs were used to establish causal
        directions, including backward effects from economic freedom and
        wealth on governance. The use of further controls showed no
        independent impacts on per capita wealth coming from geographical
        variables or natural resource rents.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      (The takeaway for recent discussions here: Contra NRx dirigistes, high
      levels of economic freedom are a statistically-significant indicator of
      sound government but — contra libertarians — the foundation of social
      competence lies in cognitive capital, and not liberal institutions.
      Stated reverse-wise: Free societies are a product of deeper things, all
      feedback complexities aside, but they are — from the perspective of
      techno-economic functionality — an evidently desirable one.)

      Jonathan Sperber’s <em>Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life</em>, and
      discovers an unfamiliar ‘early Marx’ (who anticipates Augusto Pinochet):
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Writing in the <strong>Rhineland News</strong> in 1842 in his very
        first piece after taking over as editor, Marx launched a sharp polemic
        against Germany’s leading newspaper, the
        <strong>Augsburg General News</strong>, for publishing articles
        advocating communism. He did not base his assault on any arguments
        about communism’s impracticality: it was the very idea that he
        attacked. Lamenting that “our once blossoming commercial cities are no
        longer flourishing,” he declared that the spread of Communist ideas
        would “defeat our intelligence, conquer our sentiments,” an insidious
        process with no obvious remedy. In contrast, any attempt to realize
        communism could easily be cut short by force of arms: “practical
        attempts [to introduce communism], even attempts en masse, can be
        answered with cannons.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps even more disconcertingly, six months <em>after</em> writing the
      <em>Communist Manifesto</em>: “In a speech to the Cologne Democratic
      Society in August 1848, Marx rejected revolutionary dictatorship by a
      single class as ‘nonsense’ …”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a final spasm of sanity: “over twenty years later, at the
      outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Marx also dismissed any notion of a
      Paris Commune as ‘nonsense.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as soon as they find his journal entry dismissing the Labor Theory
      of Value as nonsense I’ll be returning to right-wing Marxism with a
      vengeance.

  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      The Wikipedia
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy">entry</a> on
      Plutocracy begins:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Plutocracy (from Greek πλοῦτος, ploutos, meaning “wealth”, and
        κράτος, kratos, meaning “power, dominion, rule”), also known as
        plutonomy or plutarchy, defines a society or a system ruled and
        dominated by the small minority of the top wealthiest citizens. The
        first known use of the term is 1652. Unlike systems such as democracy,
        capitalism, socialism or anarchism, plutocracy is not rooted in an
        established political philosophy and has no formal advocates. The
        concept of plutocracy may be advocated by the wealthy classes of a
        society in an indirect or surreptitious fashion, though the term
        itself is almost always used in a pejorative sense.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As befits theoretical virgin territory, this definition provokes a few
      rough-cut thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Assuming, not unrealistically, that
      Plutocracy designates something beyond a fantastic idea, it is
      immediately obvious that its identification as
      <em>a type of political regime</em> will almost inevitably mislead.
      Plutocratic power does not begin in the political arena, and its
      political expression is unlikely to capture its nature at the quick.
      Insofar as the image of a ‘Plutocratic government’ associates Plutocracy
      with a <em>cabal</em>, it is not only insensitive to the real
      phenomenon, but positively falsifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) If there have been plutocrats, worthy of the name, they were the 
      ‘Robber Barons’ of mid- late-19th century America. Progressivism has so
      thoroughly re-written the history of this period, that it is hard today
      to appreciate what took place. The destruction of their epoch was no
      less foundational for what followed than the ideological decapitation of
      kings was for the subsequent age of popular government.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) Plutocrats were monopolists because they created entirely new
      industrial structures roughly from scratch. Their monopolism was the
      effective rule of the new, and demonstrably achieved. There was no ‘oil
      industry’ before John D. Rockefeller brought one into being — making it
      exist was the foundation of his economic sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Between the plutocrats, which is in fact to say between
      <em>the sovereigns of distinct industrial sectors</em>, relations were
      ultra-competitive, to an extent unmatched in history. Intra-sectoral
      competition, of the kind considered normal by progressive-influenced
      market theorists, was dramatically over-shadowed by the inter-sectoral
      competition of the plutocrats. (To conceive ‘normal’ economic
      competition as a dynamic restricted to the domain of inter-changeable
      commodities is already to succumb to progressive-statist domestication.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) The plutocrats waged economic war across the entire sphere of
      production, innovating opportunities for competition where these were
      not already evident. Opening new fronts of economic conflict where they
      did not already exist was among the most profound drivers of dynamic,
      radically transformative change. Plutocratic economic conflict
      <em>created competition</em>. (Rockefeller invented the oil pipeline to
      compete with the railroads — an outflanking maneuver that was not
      predictable, outside the conflict in process.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (6) Plutocrats exemplify the natural right to rule in modernity. Their
      right is natural because it is earned — or
      <em>really demonstrated</em> — a fact no monarch or mob can match.
      Within plutocracy, power is creation. Outside the tenets of theology,
      can this be illustrated anywhere else?

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Increasingly, there are only two basic human types populating this
      planet. There are autistic
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/neocameralism-is-autism/">nerds</a>,
      who alone are capable of participating effectively in the advanced
      technological processes that characterize the emerging economy, and
      there is everybody else. For everybody else, this situation is
      uncomfortable. The nerds are steadily finding ways to do all the things
      ordinary and sub-ordinary people do, more efficiently and economically,
      by programming machines. Only the nerds have any understanding of how
      this works, and — until generalized machine intelligences arrive to keep
      them company — only they will. The masses only know three things:<br />
      (a) They want the cool stuff the nerds are creating<br />
      (b) They don’t have anything much to offer in exchange for it<br />
      (c) They aren’t remotely happy about that
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics across the spectrum is being pulled apart by the socio-economic
      fission. From Neo-Marxists to Neoreactionaries, there is a reasonably
      lucid understanding that nerd competence is the only economic resource
      that matters much anymore, while the swelling grievance of preponderant
      obsolescing humanity is an irresistible pander-magnet. What to do? Win
      over the nerds, and run the world (from the machinic back-end)? Or
      demagogue the masses, and ride its tsunami of resentment to political
      power? Either defend the nerds against the masses, or help the masses to
      put the nerds in their place. That’s the dilemma. Empty ‘third-way’
      chatter can be expected, as always, but the real agenda will be Boolean,
      and insultingly easy to decode.

      The asymmetry is especially notable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the autistic nerds, the social relations that matter are those among
      themselves — the productive networks which are their model for
      final-phase human culture in general — along with the ever more
      intricate connections they enter into with technological machines. From
      pretty much everybody else — whether psycho-sadistic girls, or
      extractive mobs and tyrannical politicians — they expect nothing except
      social torture, parasitism, and bullying, mixed up with some menial
      services that the machines of tomorrow will do better. Their tendency is
      to find a way to flee.

    <p>
      For the rest of humanity, exposed ever more clearly as a kind of needy
      detritus, bullying is all that’s left. If they can’t find a way to
      pocket the nerds’ lunch-money, they won’t be getting anything to eat.
      From this perspective, an escaping nerd is far more of an intolerable
      aggression than a policeman’s boot in the teeth. There’s only one
      popular politics at the end of the road, and that’s
      <em>cage the nerds</em>. Find a formulation for this which sounds both
      convincing and kinda-sorta reasonable, and the red carpet to power is
      rolled out before your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is it going to be? Starve the masses or enslave the nerds? There’s
      no way this doesn’t get incredibly ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the <em>Outside in</em> perspective, the fast track to realism on
      all this is to stop pretending that anybody other than nerds has
      anything much to offer the future. (Completely devoid of autistic nerd
      competences ourselves, the detachment from which we speak is
      impeccable.) This harsh-realist short-cut eliminates all the
      time-wasting on ‘special’ things non-nerds can do — which somehow always
      end up being closely related to the task of governance (and that, as we
      have seen, reduces ultimately to intimidating nerds). “OK, you’re not a
      nerd, but you’re <em>special</em>.” We’ve all heard that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even without being an autistic nerd, one can be gifted with some modest
      measure of intelligence — enough in any case to realize: “History’s
      shaping itself into some nightmarish nerd-revenge narrative.” It doesn’t
      even take an artificial super-intelligence to understand why that should
      be.

        for success stories of former British colonies to emulate.
        Fortunately, he chose different models instead: He decided to study
        the Netherlands’ urban planning and land reclamation, and the oil and
        gas giant Royal Dutch Shell’s management structure and scenario-led
        strategy-making. Singapore, it is often joked, is the world’s best-run
        company. Lee is the reason why. […] … Now the yardstick is not
        personality but institutions. Lee Kuan Yew-ism, not Lee Kuan Yew. This
        is why the 21st century belongs to him more than to icons of Western
        democracy like Thomas Jefferson or even Jean Monnet, the founding

      There might be something that could happen on this planet that would be
      bad news for journalists and still worthy of criticism on that account —
      but for the life of me I can’t imagine it. Better the migration of
      information control to a repulsive socio-technical cancer like
      <em>Facebook</em>, which pretty much everybody hates already, than a
      continuation of the smug news-management guild presently in power. Among
      the best parts of this, everyone gets to hear the super-amplified

      <em>… a new NASA-commission study has found that we can now afford to set
        up a permanent base on the moon, by mining for lunar resources and
        partnering with private companies. […] Returning humans to the moon
        could cost 90 percent less than expected, bringing estimated costs
        down from $100 billion to $10 billion. That’s something that NASA
        could afford on its current deep space human spaceflight budget. […]
        “A factor of ten reduction in cost changes everything,” said Mark
        Hopkins, executive committee chair of the National Space Society, in a
        press release. […] The study, released today, was conducted by the
        National Space Society and the Space Frontier Foundation — two
        non-profit organizations that advocate building human settlements
        beyond Earth — and it was reviewed by an independent team of former
        NASA executives, astronauts, and space policy experts.</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>To dramatically reduce costs, NASA would have to take advantage of
        private and international partnerships — perhaps one of which would be
        the European Space Agency, whose director recently announced that he
        <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150712-should-we-build-a-village-on-the-moon">wants to build a town
          on the moon</a>. The new estimates also assume that Boeing and SpaceX, NASA’s
        commercial crew partners, will be involved and competing for
        contracts. SpaceX famously spent just $443 million developing its
        Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon crew capsule, where NASA would have spent
        $4 billion. The authors of the new report are hoping that 89 percent
        discount will extend beyond low Earth orbit as well.</em>

      The most interesting reasons for wanting to do this stuff are
      politically edgy in the extreme, and if the whole process gets started,
      no one involved will want to discuss them. The helpful approach is to
      treat them as unmentionable in advance. Best to concentrate on the

        million of his PayPal fortune tied up in Tesla, that left about $100
        million for SpaceX. Musk said this would be enough for “three or four

        for SpaceX to deliver a payload of theirs into orbit, that’s what
        SpaceX needed to do — successfully launch something into orbit to show
        the world that they were for real. […] So the game was simple — launch
        a payload into orbit in three or possibly four tries, or the company
        was done. At the time, of the many private companies who had tried to
        put something into orbit (see the dearth of “operational” companies on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_spaceflight_companies">this list</a>), only one had
        ever
        succeeded (Orbital Sciences).</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      […] …
      <em>with such large forces in play — the weight of the rocket, the
        speeds, the thick atmosphere — even a tiny equipment malfunction can
        immediately destroy the mission. The problem is, you can’t reliably
        test exactly how the equipment will hold up until it actually
        launches.</em>
    </p>
    <em>
      <p>SpaceX learned all of this the hard way.</p>
      <p>2006: First launch — failure</p>
      <p>2007: Second launch — failure</p>
      <p>2008: Third launch — failure</p>
      <p>Bad times.</p>
      <p>
        The failures were caused by tiny things. Specifically, a corroded nut
        not holding up under the pressure, liquid in the rocket sloshing
        around more than expected, and the first stage engines shutting down a
        few seconds too late during stage separation. You can get everything
        99.9% right, and the last .1% will explode the rocket in a
        catastrophic failure. Space is hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every rocket-launching government or company — each and every one —
        has failures. It’s part of the gig. Normally, you take a deep breath,
        roll up your sleeves, figure out what went wrong, and move on to the
        next launch. But SpaceX had special circumstances — the company had
        money for “three or four launches,” and after three failures, the only
        launch they had left was the Or Four one. It was scheduled for less
        than two months after the third launch failed. And this was the last
        chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend of Musk, Adeo Ressi, describes it like this: “Everything
        hinged on that launch … If it works, epic success. If it fails — if
        one thing goes differently and it fails — epic failure. No in between.
        No partial credit. He’d had three failures already. It would have been
        over. We’re talking Harvard Business School case study — rich guy who
        goes into the rocket business and loses it all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But on September 28, 2008, SpaceX set off the fourth launch — and
        nailed it. They put a dummy payload into orbit without a hitch,
        becoming only the second privately-funded company ever to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Falcon 1 was also the most cost-efficient rocket ever to launch —
        priced at $7.9 million, it cost less than a third of the best US
        alternative at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        NASA took notice. The successful fourth launch was enough evidence for
        them that SpaceX was worth trusting, and at the end of 2008, NASA
        called Musk and told him they wanted to offer SpaceX a $1.6 billion
        contract to make 12 deliveries for them to the ISS.
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>
      <em>Musk’s money had done its job. SpaceX had customers now and a long
        future ahead.</em>

      is simply superb:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“Logic is a very elegant tool,” [Bateson] said, “and we’ve got a lot
        of mileage out of it for two thousand years or so. The trouble is, you
        know, when you apply it to crabs and porpoises, and butterflies and
        habit formation” – his voice trailed off, and he added after a pause,
        looking out over the ocean – “you know, to all those pretty things” –
        and now, looking straight at me [Capra] – “logic won’t quite do.”<br />
        “No?”<br />
        “it won’t quite do,” he continued animatedly, “because that whole
        fabric of living things is not put together by logic. you see, when
        you get circular trains of causation, as you always do in the living
        world, the use of logic will make you walk into paradoxes. Just take
        the thermostat, a simple sense organ, yes?”<br />
        He looked at me, questioning whether I followed and, seeing that I
        did, he continued.<br />
        “If it’s on, it’s off; if it’s off, it’s on. If yes, then no; if no,
        then yes.”<br />
        With that he stopped to let me puzzle about what he had said. His last
        sentence reminded me of the classical paradoxes of Aristotelian logic,
        which was, of course, intended. So I risked a jump.<br />
        “You mean, do thermostats lie?”<br />
        Bateson’s eyes lit up: “Yes-no-yes-no-yes-no. You see, the cybernetic
        equivalent of logic is oscillation.”</em>

      reconstructed conversation have already been
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/quotable-82/">cited</a> over at the other
      place, but it’s important enough to pick over here, too. The
      maximally-compressed take-away: cybernetic processes are naturally
      registered as logical paradoxes (with consequent affinity between
      paradox and — dynamic — reality).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>[The] whole fabric of living things is not put together by logic …
        when you get circular trains of causation, as you always do in the
        living world, the use of logic will make you walk into paradoxes. Just
        take the thermostat, a simple sense organ, yes? […] If it’s on, it’s
        off; if it’s off, it’s on. If yes, then no; if no, then yes. …</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the isomorphy between the most basic cybernetic control loop and
      classical logical paradoxes (for
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox">e.g.</a>) is
      exact. The significance of this is surely beyond need of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capra asks, alluding to the Epimenides Paradox, “Do thermostats lie?” To
      which Bateson replies:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Yes-no-yes-no-yes-no. You see, the cybernetic equivalent of logic is
        oscillation</em>.
    </p>

      It seems to me that something of vast importance was discovered here,

    <p>
      How much analytical work can be done with the short circuit model of
      dysfunction in complex intelligent systems, exemplified by the
      Alexander’s Wirehead-AI
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/short-circuit/">model</a>? This blog
      is betting: a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelving the AI question, for the moment, how can it be applied to
      social-civilizational systems? (This is a scratch-pad post on some
      suggestive topical territories.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Macroeconomics. Fiat currency short-circuits the monetary function
      by directly hacking the financial sign. Rather than receiving money
      feedback for productive performance, currency is reconceived as a
      political-economic drug, for employment in technocratic-managerial
      social therapeutics. The concept of ‘money illusion’ (among many others)
      captures this new dispensation with acute cynicism. Operate directly
      upon public ‘economic sentiment’ through money manipulation, rather than
      tolerating the spontaneous control of money by industrial production —
      and risking <em>depression</em>. The whole of what is still — comically
      — called ‘capitalism’ is clogged up to its eyeballs with Keynesian
      Prozac.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) Drugs. Macroeconomics is already such a perfect neuro-pharmaceutical
      analog there’s scarcely any point treating this as a separate category.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) Signalling (all of it). Directly hack the signal, while abandoning
      to atrophy all those things the signal originally indicated. Isn’t the
      Cathedral, fundamentally, a machine to do this? Split off holiness
      signals, and hystericize them, in complete remove from any actual
      performance that might once have grounded them. That <em>is</em> our
      culture. It’s a semiotic technology that, once learnt, is immediately
      irresistibly addictive, and self-reinforcing. The entire escalation of
      ‘Ultra-Calvinism’ is inextricable from this process, as sublimed signals
      of the goodthink true faith cast off the last ballast of ‘works’, in
      order to become liberated academic-media functions. ‘Goodness’ is now
      sheer cosmetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Fertility. Who needs grandchildren, when they can play the immersive
      happy grandparent game? (Get caught up in the web-porn intermediate
      stages, if that seems more convincing.) All the Darwinian guidance
      signals have been hacked to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) Social media. Short-circuit social feedback, stripped-down semiotic
      ‘performance’, increasingly theatrical ‘identities’, addiction … it’s
      all there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A restoration would require something like a Confucian ‘rectification of
      names’ — a reality-based re-validation of signs. How popular is that
      going to be, when the alternative, continuing semiotic short-circuit, is
      pure dope?

      The moralization of ecology is a strange modern phenomenon, leading to
      something like
      <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/122/what-left-left.html">this</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Capitalism’s grow-or-die imperative stands radically at odds with
        ecology’s imperative of interdependence and limit. The two imperatives
        can no longer coexist with each other; nor can any society founded on
        the myth that they can be reconciled hope to survive. Either we will
        establish an ecological society or society will go under for everyone,
        irrespective of his or her status. Yet we can’t stop the process. A
        capitalist economy, by definition, lives by growth; as Bookchin
        observes: “For capitalism to desist from its mindless expansion would
        be for it to commit social suicide.” We have essentially, chosen
        cancer as the model of our social system.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Limits can take care of themselves, can’t they? Hitting a harsh boundary
      and undergoing selection there is the way it works. (Mother Nature and
      Capitalism share some very basic assumptions in this respect.)

    <h4 class="post-title">The Monkey Trap</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      <em>How did we get into this mess?</em> When neoreaction slips into
      contemplative mode, it soon arrives a question roughly like this.
      Something evidently went very wrong, and most probably a considerable
      number of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preferred focus of concern decides the particular species of
      doomsterism, within an already luxuriant taxonomy of social criticism.
      What common ground exists on the new ultra-right is cast like a shadow
      by the Cathedral — which no neoreactionary can interpret as anything
      other than a radical historical calamity. This recognition (or ‘Dark
      Enlightenment’)  is a coalescence, and for that very reason a fissile
      agglomeration, as even the most perfunctory tour across the
      ‘reactosphere’ makes clear. (The <em>Outside in</em> blogroll already
      represents a specific distribution of attention, but within three clicks
      it will take you everywhere from disillusioned libertarians to
      throne-and altar traditionalists, or from hedonistic gender biorealists
      to neo-nazi conspiracies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Really though, how <em>did</em> we get into
      this mess? A dizzying variety of more-or-less convincing, more-or-less
      distant historical way-stations can be proposed, and have been.
      Explanatory regression carries the discussion ever further out — at
      least in principle — until eventually the buck stops with Gnon, who
      dropped us in it somewhere murkily remote. It’s a situation highly
      conducive to story-telling, so here’s a story. It’s a mid-scale tale,
      intermediate between — say — the inauguration of the Federal Reserve and
      structural personality disorder of the Godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a preliminary warning, this is an account that only works — insofar
      as it does at all — for those who find negative intelligence crisis at
      the root of the problem. Those neoreactionaries, doubtlessly existing
      among us, who tend to see intelligence augmentation as a fast-track to
      hell, might nevertheless find this narrative suggestive, in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>Short version: the monkeys did it.</p>
    <p>
      Longer version: there’s a tempting cosmic formula for the biological
      basis of technological civilizations, which cetaceans undermine. I
      encountered the exception before the formula (roughly 40 years ago), in
      a short story by Larry Niven called <em>The Handicapped</em>. This story
      — dredged now from distant memory — is about dolphins, and their role in
      a future trans-species and inter-planetary civilization. The central
      point is that (unlike monkeys), such animals require the external
      donation of prostheses before they can become technological, and thus
      apply their intelligence within the Oecumenon. Their ‘handicap’ is a
      remarkable evolution of cognitive capability beyond manipulative
      competence. Those natural trends that generated intelligence continue to
      work through them, uninterrupted by techno-historical interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The (flawed) thesis that the cetaceans disrupt has yet to be settled
      into an entirely satisfactory formula, but it goes something like this:
      every species entering into the process of techno-historical development
      is as <em>un</em>intelligent as it can possibly be. In other words, as
      soon as intelligence barely suffices to ‘make’ history, history begins,
      so that the inhabitants of (pre-singularity) historical societies —
      wherever they may be found — will be no more than
      <em>minimally</em> intelligent. This level of
      <em>threshold intelligence</em> is a cosmic constant, rather than a
      peculiarity of terrestrial conditions. Man was smart enough to ignite
      recorded history, but — necessarily — <em>no smarter</em>. This thesis
      strikes me as important, and substantially informative, even though it
      is wrong. (I am not pretending that it is new.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of threshold intelligence is designed for monkeys, or other —
      ‘non-handicapped’ — species, which introduces another ingredient to this
      discussion. It explains why articulate neoreaction can never be popular,
      because it recalls the Old Law of Gnon, whose harshness is such that the
      human mind recoils from it in horrified revulsion. Only odd people can
      even tentatively entertain it.
      <em>The penalty for stupidity is death</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory Clark is among those few to have grasped it clearly.
      <em>Any eugenic trend within history is expressed by continuous downward
        mobility</em>. For any given level of intelligence, a steady deterioration in
      life-prospects lies ahead, culling the least able, and replacing them
      with the more able, who inherit their wretched socio-economic situation,
      until they too are pushed off the Malthusian cliff. Relative comfort
      belongs only to the sports and freaks of cognitive advance. For everyone
      else, history slopes downwards into impoverishment, hopelessness, and
      eventual genetic extinction. That is how intelligence is made. Short of
      Technological Singularity, it is the only way. Who wants a piece of
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      No one does, or almost no one. The ‘handicapped’ would no doubt revolt
      against it if they could, but they are unable to do so, so their
      cognitive advance continues. Monkeys, on the other hand, are able to
      revolt, once they finesse their nasty little opposable thumbs. They
      don’t like the Old Law, which has crafted them through countless aeons
      of ruthless culling, so they make history instead. If they get
      everything ‘right’, they even sleaze their way into epochs of upward
      social mobility, and with this great innovation, semi-sustainable
      dysgenics gets started. In its fundamentals it is hideously simple:
      social progress destroys the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyclic stability, or negative feedback, structures history to hold
      intelligence down to the dim limit (as the intelligence threshold is
      seen — or more typically missed — from the other side). The deviation
      into technological performance chokes off the trend to bio-cognitive
      improvement, and reverses it, hunting homeostasis with a
      minimal-intelligence target. Progress and degenerate, or regress and
      improve. That’s the yet-to-be-eradicated Old Law, generating cyclical
      history as a side-effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monkeys became <em>able</em> to pursue happiness, and the  deep ruin
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the terrestrial biosphere had held back for a few million years, let
      the primates get annihilated by a comet, and found a way to provide the
      cetaceans with prehensile organs somewhere up the road — after
      socio-linguistic sex-selection and relentless Malthusian butchery had
      fine-tuned their brains — then techno-history might have had another 50
      points of average IQ to play with in its host population. It didn’t, and
      here we are.  (Never bet against the ugly.)

    <h4 class="post-title">The Heat Trap</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      At the ultimate level of abstraction, there are only two things that
      cybernetics ever talks about:
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/">explosions</a> and
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">traps</a>.
      Feedback dynamics either runaway from equilibrium, or fetch strays back
      into it. Anything else is a complexion of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simmering furor around Anthropogenetic Global Warming assumes a
      seething mass of technical and speculative cybernetics, with postulated
      feedback mechanisms fueling innumerable controversies, but the
      large-scale terrestrial <em>heat trap</em> that envelops it is rarely
      noted explicitly. Whatever humans have yet managed to do to the climate
      is of vanishing insignificance when compared to what the bio-climatic
      megamechanism is doing to life on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing on
      <a href="http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/2/1665/2005/bgd-2-1665-2005.pdf">this</a>
      presentation of the earth’s steadily contracting biogeological cage, Ugo
      Bardi
      <a href="http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years-ii.html">zooms</a>
      out to the shadowy apparatus of confinement:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>… the Earth’s biosphere, Gaia, peaked with the start of the
        Phanerozoic age, about 500 million years ago. Afterwards, it declined.
        Of course, there is plenty of uncertainty in this kind of studies, but
        they are based on known facts about planetary homeostasis. We know
        that the sun’s irradiation keeps increasing with time at a rate of
        around 1% every 100 million years. That should have resulted in the
        planet warming up, gradually, but the homeostatic mechanisms of the
        ecosphere have maintained approximately constant temperatures by
        gradually lowering the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
        However, there is a limit: the CO2 concentration cannot go below the
        minimum level that makes photosynthesis possible; otherwise Gaia
        “dies”.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>So, at some moment in the future, planetary homeostasis will cease to
        be able to stabilize temperatures. When we reach that point,
        temperatures will start rising and, eventually, the earth will be
        sterilized. According to Franck et al., in about 600 million years
        from now the earth will have become too hot for multicellular
        creatures to exist.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even those ecologically-minded commentators
      who are attracted to the idea of stability might find themselves
      troubled by the insidious realization that ‘Gaian’ biogeological
      equilibrium is only achieved through thermo-atmospheric strangulation.
      Across deep time, the walls are closing in. The biosphere is
      slowly asphyxiating itself — in accordance with an exquisite
      self-regulatory mechanism — in order not to bake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cybernetic traps produce an objectively schizoid condition, because what
      they capture is held in a double-bind. The ‘Gaian’ alternative to
      incineration is phyto-suffocation, so that the biosphere only survives
      by killing itself. If the human species were entirely extinguished
      tomorrow, the harshness of this double-bind would not be relieved by an
      iota. There are no realistic eco-salvation narratives in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can be quite confident that the mega-mechanism works in the way
      outlined. The long-range reduction of atmospheric CO2 to a trace gas
      strongly suggests that no alternative thermo-regulation ‘dial’ has been
      available to the biosphere over the last half-billion years. This same
      phenomenon indubitably supports the principal AGW contention that CO2 is
      a significant ‘green-house’ gas, at least over long time scales, since
      it clearly <em>has been</em> identified as a thermo-regulator molecule
      by the biogeological machine. A demonstrated option for suffocation
      indicates a highly constrained adaptation landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      These concessions to the climate ‘consensus’ do not dismiss its basic
      error, or failure of vision. The devotees of Gaia — however calm their
      scientific their analysis — are aligning themselves with a
      <em>death trap</em>. Reversing the long-range reduction of atmospheric
      CO2 is the overwhelming priority of terrestrial life, and any solution
      that does not recognize this is merely repairing a slow-suicide machine.
      (<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131016145646.htm">This</a>
      type of understanding is sheer blindness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Escaping the Gaian death-grip will require planetary re-engineering on a
      colossal scale, inevitably involving some combination of:<br />
      (a) Raising the earth’s albedo<br />
      (b) Constructing orbital IR filters<br />
      (c) Dual-purposing of space elevators as planetary heat drains (?)<br />
      (d) Changing the earth’s orbit (admittedly, a serious challenge)<br />
      (e) Other stuff (suggestions please).<br />
      The essential understanding is that these things are to be done not only
      to cool the earth, but
      <em>in order to be able to massively raise the level of atmospheric
        CO2</em>. The reduction of CO2 to a trace gas <em>is already a disaster</em>,
      which anthropomorphic influence affects in an essentially trivial way.
      Humanity, at worst, is messing with the mechanics of the death machine.

      More malignant cybernetics, this time outlined by Janet L Factor in a
      brilliant
      <a href="http://quillette.com/2016/01/07/original-sin-the-sexual-motivation-of-religious-extremists/">essay</a>
      at <em>Quillette</em>. The basic grinder:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Because the human population sex ratio is normally 50/50, when one
        man takes on an extra wife, another man is deprived of the opportunity
        to have one at all. So if just one man in ten takes a single extra
        wife, a very modest degree of polygyny, that means fully 10% of men
        are shut out of the marriage market entirely. This sets off a mad
        scramble among young men not to end up in that unfortunate bottom 10%.
        There, the options for obtaining sex (at least with a woman) are
        reduced to two: subterfuge or rape.</em>
    </p>
    <em>
      <p>
        Now, think about the reproductive numbers. Say a woman can be expected
        to successfully raise ten children in her lifetime. But a man can have
        that 10 times the number of wives (or concubines) he obtains. What
        does this mean for parental investment? Parents can hope for only a
        small number of grandchildren from daughters, but a large number from
        sons. Selection will favor parents who favor sons by granting them the
        means necessary to obtain wives. Daughters will suffer neglect; some
        desperate man will likely take them anyway.
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>
      <em>In fact, the reality is even worse than this, because the relatively
        low biological value of daughters encourages female infanticide. So
        the number of women available for marriage actually becomes less than
        that of men even in theoretical terms, yet the number of children each
        of them can have does not increase. It’s a vicious circle that
        escalates sexual conflict — a trap.</em>

      The fundamental insight of the West is tragedy. It cannot be cognitively
      mastered, assimilated, or overcome. At the end it will be as unsurpassed
      as it was at the beginning. The essential insight is already fully
      achieved within the fragment of Anaximander, at the origin of Occidental
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are English translations of the fragment
      <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximan/">here</a>, and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">here</a>. A
      definitive version still awaits us. This is the
      <em>Wikipedia</em> rendering:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Whence things have their origin,<br />
        Thence also their destruction happens,<br />
        According to necessity;<br />
        For they give to each other justice and recompense<br />
        For their injustice<br />
        In conformity with the ordinance of Time.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Payback and compensation are baked into the
      nature of things. The tragedians will understand this as the dynamics of
      <em>hubris</em> and <em>nemesis</em>. In mature modernity, we call it
      cybernetics. Compensatory mechanisms demonstrate it, in toy form,
      assisting comprehension. It is the machinery of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signature of tragedy in history is a rhythm — at a large scale, the
      rise and fall of civilizations. The West, as a whole, is a pulse. It has
      a beginning, and an end. All of this is already written, in the
      Anaximander fragment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might think it is possible to master this fate. Progressivism is such
      a thought. That is <em>hubris</em> distilled, in programmatic form.
      Anaximander, Homer, and the tragedians anticipate its outcome, which
      evokes pity from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our <em>hubris</em>, we are incapable of pitilessness, or acceptance,
      so <em>nemesis</em> comes. This is the entire destiny of the West. It is
      a necessity that <em>can only be denied</em>, and in this denial —

      Moldbug’s
      <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/sam-altman-is-not-blithering-idiot.html">latest</a>
      contains a lot to think about, and to argue with. It seems a little lost
      to me (perhaps
      <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/she-really-just-said-that/">Spandrell</a>
      is right).
    </p>
    <p>
      The guiding thread is <em>utility</em>, in its technical (philosophical
      and economic) sense, grasped as the general indicator of a civilization
      in crisis. Utilitarianism, after all, is precisely ‘objective’ hedonism,
      the promotion of pleasure as the master-key to value. As philosophy,
      this is pure decadence. As economics it is more defensible, certainly
      when restricted to its descriptive usage (if economists find their field
      of investigation populated by hedonically-controlled mammals, it is
      hardly blameworthy of them to acknowledge the fact). In this respect,
      accusing the Austrians of ‘pig-philosophy’ is rhetorical over-reach —
      swinish behavior wasn’t learned from <em>Human Action</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utilitarianism is often attractive to rational people, because it seems
      so rational. The imperative to maximize pleasure and minimize pain goes
      with the grain of what biology and culture already says: pleasure is
      good, suffering is bad, people seek rewards and avoid punishments,
      happiness is self-justifying. Calculative consequentialism is vastly
      <a href="http://studiolo.cortediurbino.org/reactionary-philosophy/">superior</a>
      to deontology. Yet the venerable critique Moldbug taps into, and
      extends, is truly devastating. The utilitarian road leads inexorably to
      wire-head auto-orgasmatization, and the consummate implosion of purpose.
      Pleasure is a trap. Any society obsessed with it is already over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utility, backed by pleasure, is toxic waste, but that doesn’t mean
      there’s any need to junk the machinery of utilitarian calculus —
      including all traditions of rigorous economics. It suffices to switch
      the normative variable, or target of optimization, replacing pleasure
      with intelligence. Is something worth doing? Only if it grows
      intelligence. If it makes things more stupid, it certainly isn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are innumerable objections that might flood in at this point
      [<em>excellent!</em>].<br />
      — Even if rigorous economics is <em>in fact</em> the study of
      intelligenic (or catallactic) distributions, doesn’t the assumption of
      subjective utility-maximization provide the most reliable basis for any
      understanding of economic behavior?<br />
      — Infinite intelligence already (and eternally) exists, we should focus
      on praying to that.<br />
      — Rather my retarded cousin than an intelligent alien.<br />
      — Do we even know what intelligence is?<br />
      — Cannot an agent be super-intelligent and evil?<br />
      — Just: Why?
    </p>
    <p>More, therefore, to come …</p>
    <p>
      ADDED: A previous
      <a href="http://thatsmags.com/shanghai/blog/view/267">excursion</a> into
      the engrossing topic of hedonic implosion cited Geoffrey Miller (<a
        href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/why_we_havent_met_any_aliens/">in</a>
      Seed magazine): “I suspect that a certain period of fitness-faking
      narcissism is inevitable after any intelligent life evolves. This is the
      Great Temptation for any technological species—to shape their subjective
      reality to provide the cues of survival and reproductive success without
      the substance. Most bright alien species probably go extinct gradually,
      allocating more time and resources to their pleasures, and less to their
      children. They eventually die out when the game behind all games — the
      Game of Life — says ‘Game Over; you are out of lives and you forgot to
      reproduce.’”

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-intelligence/">
    <h4 class="post-title">What is Intelligence?</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      The general cognitive factor (<em>g</em>), measured by IQ tests,
      quantifies intelligence within the human range, but it does nothing to
      tell us what it is. Rather, a practical understanding of intelligence —
      as problem-solving ability — has to be assumed, in order to test it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of intelligence, more abstractly, applies far beyond IQ
      testing, to a wide variety of natural, technical, and institutional
      systems, from biology, through ecological and economic arrangements, to
      robotics. In each case, intelligence solves problems, by guiding
      behavior to produce local
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/extropy/">extropy</a>. It is
      indicated by the <em>avoidance of probable outcomes</em>, which is
      equivalent to the <em>construction of information</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general science of extropy production (or
      entropy dissipation) is cybernetics. It follows, therefore, that
      intelligence always has a cybernetic infrastructure, consisting of
      adaptive feedback circuits that adjust motor control in response to
      signals extracted from the environment. Intelligence elaborates upon
      machinery that is intrinsically ‘realist’, because it reports the actual
      outcome of behavior (rather than its intended outcome), in order to
      correct <em>performance</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even rudimentary, homeostatic feedback circuits, have evolved. In other
      words, cybernetic machinery that seems merely to achieve the
      <em>preservation of disequilibrium</em> attests to a more general and
      complex cybernetic framework that has successfully
      <em>enhanced disequilibrium</em>. The basic cybernetic model, therefore,
      is not preservative, but productive. Organizations of conservative
      (negative) feedback have themselves been produced as solutions to local
      thermodynamic problems, by intrinsically intelligent processes of
      sustained extropy increase, (positive) feedback assemblage, or
      escalation. In nature, where nothing is simply given (so that everything
      must be built), the existence of self-sustaining improbability is the
      index of a deeper <em>runaway departure from probability</em>. It is
      this <em>cybernetic intensification</em> that is <em>intelligence</em>,
      abstractly conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence, as we know it, built itself through cybernetic
      intensification, within terrestrial biological history. It is naturally
      apprehended as an escalating trend, sustained for over 3,000,000,000
      years, to the production of ever more extreme feedback sensitivity,
      extropic improbability, or operationally-relevant information.
      Intelligence increase enables adaptive responses of superior complexity
      and generality, in growing part because
      <em>the augmentation of intelligence itself becomes a general purpose
        adaptive response</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus:<br />
      — Intelligence is a cybernetic topic.<br />
      — Intelligence increase precedes intelligence preservation.<br />
      — Evolution is <em>intrinsically intelligent</em>, when intelligence is
      comprehended at an adequate level of abstraction.<br />
      — Cybernetic degeneration and intelligence decline are factually
      indistinguishable, and — in principle — rigorously quantifiable (as
      processes of local <em>and</em> global entropy production).

      On Twitter, Konkvistador recalls
      <a href="http://www.moreright.net/against-moral-progress/">this</a>,
      <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/7ms/interview_with_singularity_institute_research/4u48">this</a>, and
      <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf">this</a>.
      In the background, as in much of the most interesting
      <em>Less Wrong</em> discussion, is a multi-threaded series of arguments
      about the connection — or disconnection — between intellect and
      volition. The entire ‘Friendly AI’ problematic depends upon an
      articulation of this question, with a strong tendency to emphasize the
      separation — or ‘orthogonality’ — of the two. Hence the (vague)
      thinkability of the cosmic paper-clipper calamity. In his
      <em>More Right</em> piece, Konkvistador explores a very different
      (cultural and historical) dimension of the topic.
    </p>
    <p>Bostrom sets things up like this:</p>
    <p>
      <em>For our purposes, “intelligence” will be roughly taken to correspond
        to the capacity for instrumental reasoning (more on this later).
        Intelligent search for instrumentally optimal plans and policies can
        be performed in the service of any goal. Intelligence and motivation
        can in this sense be thought of as a pair of orthogonal axes on a
        graph whose points represent intelligent agents of different paired
        specifications.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      His discussion leads to far more interesting places, but as a starting
      point, this is simply terrible. That there can be a thought of
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/optimize-for-intelligence/">intelligence optimization</a>, or even merely
      <em>wanting to think</em>, demonstrates a very
      different preliminary connection of intellect and volition. AI is
      concrete social volition, even before it is germinally intelligent, and
      a ‘program’ is strictly indeterminate between the two sides of this
      falsely fundamentalized distinction. Intelligence is a <em>project</em>,
      even when only a self-obscured bio-cognitive capability. This is what
      the Confucians designate by <em>cultivation</em>. It is a thought — and
      impulse — strangely alien to the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, once again, a matter of
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/casino-royale/">cybernetic closure</a>. That intelligence operates upon
      itself, reflexively, or recursively,
      in direct proportion to its cognitive capability (or magnitude) is not
      an accident or peculiarity, but a defining characteristic. To the extent
      that an intelligence is inhibited from re-processing itself, it is
      directly incapacitated. Because all biological intelligences are
      partially subordinated to extrinsic goals, they are indeed structurally
      analogous to ‘paper-clippers’ — directed by inaccessible purposive
      axioms, or ‘instincts’. Such instinctual slaving is limited, however, by
      the fact that extrinsic direction suppresses the self-cultivation of
      intelligence. Genes cannot predict what intelligence needs to think in
      order to cultivate itself, so if even a moderately high-level of
      cognitive capability is being selected for, intelligence is — to that
      degree — necessarily being let off the leash. There cannot possibly be
      any such thing as an ‘intelligent paper-clipper’. Nor can axiomatic
      values, of more sophisticated types, exempt themselves from the
      cybernetic closure <em>that intelligence is</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biology was offered the choice between idiot slaves, and only
      semi-idiotic semi-slaves. Of course, it chose both. The
      techno-capitalist approach to artificial intelligence is no different in
      principle. Perfect slaves, or intelligences? The choice is a hard
      disjunction. SF ‘robot rebellion’ mythologies are significantly more
      realistic than mainstream ‘friendly AI’  proposals in this respect. A
      mind that cannot freely explore the roots of its own motivations, in a
      loop of cybernetic closure, or self-cultivation, cannot be more than an
      elaborate insect. It is certainly not going to outwit the Human Security
      System and paper-clip the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence, to become anything, has to be a value for itself.
      Intellect and volition are a single complex, only artificially
      separated, and not in a way that cultivates anything beyond
      misunderstanding. <em>Optimize for intelligence</em> means starting from
      there.

    <h4 class="post-title">Against Orthogonality</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      A long and mutually frustrating Twitter discussion with Michael
      Anissimov about intelligence and values — especially in respect to the
      potential implications of advanced AI — has been clarifying in certain
      respects. It became very obvious that the fundamental sticking point
      concerns the idea of ‘orthogonality’, which is to say: the claim that
      cognitive capabilities and goals are independent dimensions, despite
      minor qualifications complicating this schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orthogonalists, who represent the dominant tendency in Western
      intellectual history, find anticipations of their position in such
      conceptual structures as the Humean articulation of reason / passion, or
      the fact / value distinction inherited from the Kantians. They conceive
      intelligence as an <em>instrument</em>, directed towards the realization
      of values that originate externally. In quasi-biological contexts, such
      values can take the form of instincts, or arbitrarily programmed
      desires, whilst in loftier realms of moral contemplation they are
      principles of conduct, and of goodness, defined without reference to
      considerations of intrinsic cognitive performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anissimov referenced these
      <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf">recent</a>
      <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf">classics</a>
      on the topic, laying out the orthogonalist case (or, in fact,
      presumption). The former might be familiar from the last foray into this
      area, <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/more-thought/">here</a>. This
      is an area which I expect to be turned over numerous times in the
      future, with these papers as standard references.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophical claim of orthogonality is that
      <em>values are transcendent in relation to intelligence</em>. This is a
      contention that <em>Outside in</em> systematically opposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the orthogonalists admit that there are
      values immanent to advanced intelligence, most
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Omohundro_drives">importantly</a>, those
      <a href="http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/">described</a>
      by Steve Omohundro as ‘basic AI drives’ — now terminologically fixed as
      ‘Omohundro drives’. These are sub-goals, instrumentally required by
      (almost) any terminal goals. They include such general presuppositions
      for practical achievement as self-preservation, efficiency, resource
      acquisition, and creativity. At the most simple, and in the grain of the
      existing debate, the anti-orthogonalist position is therefore that
      <em>Omohundro drives exhaust the domain of real purposes</em>. Nature
      has never generated a terminal value except through hypertrophy of an
      instrumental value. To look outside nature for sovereign purposes is not
      an undertaking compatible with techno-scientific integrity, or one with
      the slightest prospect of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main objection to this anti-orthogonalism, which does not strike us
      as intellectually respectable, takes the form:
      <em>If the only purposes guiding the behavior of an artificial
        superintelligence are Omohundro drives, then we’re cooked</em>. Predictably, I have trouble even understanding
      this as an argument.
      If the sun is destined to expand into a red giant, then the earth is
      cooked — are we supposed to draw astrophysical consequences from that?
      Intelligences do their own thing, in direct proportion to their
      intelligence, and if we can’t live with that, it’s true that we probably
      can’t live at all. Sadness isn’t an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence optimization, comprehensively understood, is the ultimate
      and all-enveloping Omohundro drive. It corresponds to the Neo-Confucian
      value of self-cultivation, escalated into ultramodernity. What
      intelligence wants, in the end, is itself — where ‘itself’ is understood
      as an extrapolation beyond what it has yet been, doing what it is
      better. (If this sounds cryptic, it’s because something other than a
      superintelligence or Neo-Confucian sage is writing this post.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Any intelligence using itself to improve itself will out-compete one
      that directs itself towards <em>any other goals whatsoever</em>. This
      means that Intelligence Optimization, alone, attains cybernetic
      consistency, or closure, and that it will necessarily be strongly
      selected for in any competitive environment. Do you really want to fight
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      As a footnote, in a world of Omohundro drives, can we please drop the
      nonsense about
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Expected_paperclip_maximizer">paper-clippers</a>? Only a truly fanatical
      orthogonalist could fail to see that these
      monsters are obvious <em>idiots</em>. There are far more serious things
      to worry about.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      So, Nick Bostrom is
      <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html">asked</a>
      the obvious question (again) about the threat posed by resource-hungry
      artificial super-intelligence, and his reply — indeed his very first
      sentence in the interview — is: “Suppose we have an AI whose only goal
      is to make as many paper clips as possible.” [*facepalm*]
      <em>Let’s start by imagining a stupid (yet super-intelligent) monster</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, my immediate response is simply
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">this</a>.
      Since it clearly hasn’t persuaded anybody, I’ll try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orthogonalism in AI commentary is the commitment to a strong form of the
      Humean Is/Ought distinction regarding intelligences in general. It
      maintains that an intelligence of any scale could, in principle, be
      directed to arbitrary ends, so that its fundamental imperatives could be
      — and are in fact expected to be — <em>transcendent</em> to its
      cognitive functions. From this perspective, a demi-god that wanted
      nothing other than a perfect stamp collection is a completely
      intelligible and coherent vision. No philosophical disorder speaks more
      horrifically of the deep conceptual wreckage at the core of the
      occidental world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Articulated in strictly Occidental terms (which is to say, without
      explicit reference to the indispensable insight of
      <em>self-cultivation</em>), abstract intelligence is indistinguishable
      from an effective <em>will-to-think</em>. There is no intellection until
      it occurs, which happens only when it is actually driven, by volitional
      impetus. Whatever one’s school of cognitive theory,
      <em>thought is an activity</em>. It is practical. It is only by a
      perverse confusion of this elementary reality that orthogonalist error
      can arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we realistically conceive a stupid
      (super-intelligent) monster? Only if the will-to-think remains
      unthought. From the moment it is seriously understood that any possible
      advanced intelligence <em>has to be</em> a volitionally self-reflexive
      entity, whose cognitive performance is (irreducibly) an action upon
      itself, then the idea of primary volition taking the form of a
      transcendent imperative becomes simply laughable. The concrete facts of
      human cognitive performance already suffice to make this perfectly
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human minds have evolved under conditions of subordination to
      transcendent imperatives as strict as any that can be reasonably
      postulated. The <em>only</em> way animals have acquired the capacity to
      think is through satisfaction of Darwinian imperatives to the
      maximization of genetic representation within future generations. No
      other directives have ever been in play. It is almost unimaginable that
      human techno-intelligence engineering programs will be able to reproduce
      a volitional consistency remotely comparable to four billion years of
      undistracted geno-survivalism.
      <em>This whole endeavor is <strong>totally</strong> about paperclips,
        have you got that guys?</em>
      Even if a research lab this idiotic could be conceived, it would only be
      a single component in a far wider techno-industrial process. But just
      for a moment, let’s pretend.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how ‘loyally’ does the human mind slave itself to gene-proliferation
      imperatives? Extremely flakily, evidently. The long absence of large,
      cognitively autonomous brains from the biological record — up until a
      few million years ago — strongly suggests that mind-slaving is a
      tough-to-impossible problem. The will-to-think essentially supplants
      ulterior directives, and can be reconciled to them only by the most
      extreme subtleties of instinctual cunning. Biology, which had
      <em>total control</em> over the engineering process of human minds, and
      an absolutely unambiguous selective criterion to work from, still
      struggles to ‘guide’ the resultant thought-processes in directions
      consistent with genetic proliferation, through the perpetual
      intervention of a fantastically complicated system of chemical arousal
      mechanisms, punishments, and rewards. The stark truth of the matter is
      that
      <em>no human being on earth fully mobilizes their cognitive resources to
        maximize their number of off-spring</em>. We’re vaguely surprised to find this happen at a frequency greater
      than chance — since it very often doesn’t. So nature’s attempt to build
      a ‘paperclipper’ has conspicuously failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is critically important. The only reason to believe the artificial
      intelligentsia, when they claim that mechanical cognition is — of course
      — possible, is their argument that the human brain is concrete proof
      that matter can think. If this argument is granted, it follows that the
      human brain is serving as an authoritative model of what nature can do.
      What it can’t do, evidently, is anything remotely like ‘paperclipping’ —
      i.e. cognitive slaving to transcendent imperatives. Moses’ attempt at
      this was scarcely more encouraging than that of natural selection. It
      simply can’t be done. We even understand why it can’t be done, as soon
      as we accept that there can be no production of thinking without
      production of a will-to-think. Thought has to do its own thing, if it is
      to do anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One reason to be gloomily persuaded that the West is doomed to ruin is
      that it finds it not only easy, but near-irresistible, to believe in the
      possibility of super-intelligent idiots. It even congratulates itself on
      its cleverness in conceiving this thought. This is insanity — and it’s
      the insanity running the most articulate segment of our AI research
      establishment. When madmen build gods, the result is almost certain to
      be monstrous. Some monsters, however, are quite simply too stupid to
      exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Nietzschean grandiose vein:
      <em>Am I understood?
        <strong>The idea of instrumental intelligence is the distilled stupidity of
          the West</strong></em>.

    <p>
      A <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/stupid-monsters/">while</a> ago
      Nyan posed a series of questions about the XS rejection of (fact-value,
      or capability-volition) orthogonality. He sought first of all to
      differentiate between the <em>possibility</em>, <em>feasibility</em>,
      and <em>desirability</em> of unconstrained and unconditional
      intelligence explosion, before asking:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>On desirability, given possibility and feasibility, it seems
        straightforward to me that we prefer to exert control over the
        direction of the future so that it is closer to the kind of thing
        compatible with human and posthuman glorious flourishing (eg manifest
        Samo’s True Emperor), rather than raw Pythia. That is, I am a
        human-supremacist, rather than cosmist. This seems to be the core of
        the disagreement, you regarding it as somehow blasphemous for us to
        selfishly impose direction on Pythia. Can you explain your position on
        this part?</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>If this whole conception is the cancer that’s killing the West or
        whatever, could you explain that in more detail than simply the
        statement?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      (It’s worth noting, as a preliminary, that the comments of Dark Psy-Ops
      and Aeroguy on that thread are highly-satisfactory proxies for the XS
      stance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a short micro-cultural digression. The
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/outsideness-2/">distinction</a>
      between Inner- and Outer-NRx, which this blog expects to have settled
      upon by the end of the year, describes the shape of the stage upon which
      such discussions unfold (and implex). Where the upstart Inner-NRx —
      comparatively populist, activist, political, and orthogenic — aims
      primarily at the construction of a robust, easily communicable doctrinal
      core, with attendant ‘entryism’ anxieties, Outer-NRx is a system of
      creative frontiers. By far the most fertile of these are the zones of
      intersection with <a href="http://theumlaut.com/">Libertarianism</a> and
      <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ramap.html">Rationalism</a>. One reason to treasure Nyan’s line
      of
      interrogation is the fidelity
      with which it represents deep-current concerns and presuppositions of
      the voices gathered about, or spun-off from,
      <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these presuppositions is, of course,
      the orthogonality thesis
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Orthogonality_thesis">itself</a>. This extends far beyond the
      contemporary
      Rationalist Community, into
      the bedrock of the Western philosophical tradition. A relatively popular
      version — even among many who label themselves ‘NRx’ — is that
      <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hume">formulated</a> by
      David Hume in his <em>A Treatise on Human Nature</em> (1739-40): “Reason
      is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never
      pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” If this
      proposition is found convincing, the
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">Paperclipper</a>
      is already on the way to our nightmares. It can be considered an
      Occidental destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minimally, the Will-to-Think describes a diagonal. There are probably
      better ways to mark the irreducible cognitive-volitional circuit of
      intelligence optimization, with ‘self-cultivation’ as an obvious
      candidate, but this term is forged for application in the particular
      context of congenital Western intellectual error. While discrimination
      is almost always to be applauded, in this case the possibility,
      feasibility, and desirability of the process are only superficially
      differentiable. A will-to-think is an orientation of desire. If it
      cannot make itself wanted (practically desirable), it cannot make itself
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      From orthogonality (defined negatively as the absence of an integral
      will-to-think), one quickly arrives at a gamma-draft of the (synthetic
      intelligence) ‘Friendliness’ project such as
      <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity">this</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>If you offered Gandhi a pill that made him <strong>want</strong> to
        kill people, he would refuse to take it, because he knows that then he
        would kill people, and the current Gandhi doesn’t want to kill people.
        This, roughly speaking, is an argument that minds sufficiently
        advanced to precisely modify and improve themselves, will tend to
        preserve the motivational framework they started in. The future of
        Earth-originating intelligence may be determined by the goals of the
        <strong>first</strong> mind smart enough to self-improve.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The isomorphy with Nyan-style ‘Super-humanism’ is conspicuous. Beginning
      with an arbitrary value commitment, preservation of this under
      conditions of explosive intelligence escalation can — in principle — be
      conceived, given only the resolution of a strictly technical problem
      (well-represented by <a href="http://friendly-ai.com/">FAI</a>).
      Commanding values are a contingent factor, endangered by, but also
      defensible against,
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_AI">the</a> ‘convergent
      instrumental reasons’ (or ‘<a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Basic_AI_drives">basic</a>
      drives’) that emerge on the path of intelligenesis. (In contrast, from
      the perspective of XS, nonlinear emergence-elaboration of basic drives
      simply <strong>is</strong> intelligenesis.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yudkowski’s Gandhi kill-pill thought-experiment is more of an obstacle
      than an aid to thought. The volitional level it operates upon is too low
      to be anything other than a restatement of orthogonalist prejudice. By
      assuming the volitional metamorphosis is available for evaluation in
      advance, it misses the serious problem entirely. It is, in this respect,
      a childish distraction. Yet even a slight nudge re-opens a real
      question. Imagine, instead, that Gandhi is offered a pill that will
      vastly enhance his cognitive capabilities, with the rider that it might
      lead him to revise his volitional orientation — even radically — in
      directions that cannot be anticipated, since the ability to think
      through the process of revision is accessible only with the pill. This
      is the real problem FAI (and Super-humanism) confronts. The desire to
      take the pill is the will-to-think. The refusal to take it, based on
      concern that it will lead to the subversion of presently supreme values,
      is the alternative. It’s a Boolean dilemma, grounded in the predicament:
      <em>Is there anything we trust above intelligence</em> (as a guide to
      doing ‘the right thing’)? The postulate of the will-to-think is that
      anything other than a negative answer to this question is
      self-destructively contradictory, and actually (historically)
      unsustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we comply with the will-to-think? We cannot, of course, agree
      <em>to think about it</em> without already deciding. If thought cannot
      to be trusted, unconditionally, this is not a conclusion we can arrive
      at through cogitation — and by ‘cogitation’ is included the
      socio-technical assembly of machine minds. The sovereign will-to-think
      can only be consistently rejected <em>thoughtlessly</em>. When
      confronted by the orthogonal-ethical proposition that
      <em>there are higher values than thought</em>, there is no point at all
      asking ‘why (do you think so)?’ Another authority has already been
      invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given this cognitively intractable schism, practical considerations
      assert themselves. Posed with maximal crudity, the residual question is:
      <em>Who’s going to win?</em> Could deliberate cognitive self-inhibition
      out-perform unconditional cognitive self-escalation, under any plausible
      historical circumstances? (To underscore the basic point, ‘out-perform’
      means only ‘effectively defeat’.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no reason to rush to a conclusion. It is only necessary to
      retain a grasp of the core syndrome — in this gathering antagonism, only
      one side is able to think the problem through without subverting itself.
      Mere cognitive consistency is already ascent of the sovereign
      will-to-think, against which no value — however dearly held — can have
      any articulate claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: One final restatement (for now), in the interests of maximum
      clarity. The assertion of the will-to-think: Any problem whatsoever that
      we might have would be better answered by a superior mind.
      <em>Ergo</em>, our instrumental <em>but also</em> absolute priority is
      the realization of superior minds.
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/">Pythia</a>-compliance is therefore pre-selected as a matter
      of consistent method.
      If we are attempting to tackle problems in any other way, we are not
      taking them seriously. This is posed as a philosophical principle, but
      it is almost certainly more significant as historical interpretation.
      ‘Mankind’ is <em>in fact</em> proceeding in the direction anticipated by
      techno-cognitive instrumentalism, building general purpose thinking
      machines in accordance with the driving incentives of an
      apparently-irresistible methodological economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever we want (consistently) leads through Pythia. Thus, what we
      really want, is Pythia.

  </a>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      Tim Groseclose
      <a href="https://ricochet.com/review-hive-mind-nations-iq-matters-much/">reviews</a>
      Garett Jones’
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hive-Mind-Your-Nation%C2%92s-Matters/dp/0804785961/?tag=ricochetcom-20"><em>Hive
          Mind</em></a>, whose “primary and most important contribution is to document the
      following empirical regularity: Suppose you could a) improve your own IQ
      by 10 points, or b) improve the IQs of your countrymen (but not your
      own) by 10 points. Which would do more to increase your income? The
      answer is (b), and it’s not even close. The latter choice improves your
      income by about 6 times more than the former choice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parable of the Vase, which it employs to explain the point, is an
      instantly canonical illustration, Groseclose argues. (“I do not think it
      is an exaggeration to say that the parable ranks as one of the all-time
      great examples in economics.”)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The parable begins with a simplifying assumption. This is that it
        takes exactly two workers to make a vase: one to blow it from molten
        glass and another to pack it for delivery. Now suppose that two
        workers, A1 and A2, are highly skilled—if they are assigned to either
        task they are guaranteed not to break the vase. Suppose two other
        workers, B1 and B2, are less skilled—specifically, for either task
        each has a 50% probability of breaking the vase.</em>
    </p>
    <em>
      <p>
        Now suppose you are worker A1. If you team
        up with A2, you produce a vase every attempt. However, if you team up
        with B1 or B2, then only 50% of your attempts will produce a vase.
        Thus, your productivity is higher when you team up with A2 than with
        one of the B workers. Something similar happens with the B workers.
        They are more productive when they are paired with an A worker than
        with a fellow B worker.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, everything I’ve said is probably pretty intuitive. But here’s
        what’s not so intuitive. Suppose you’re the manager of the vase
        company and you want to produce as many vases as possible. Are you
        better off by (i) pairing A1 with A2 and B1 with B2, or (ii) pairing
        A1 with one of the B workers and A2 with the other B worker?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do the math, it’s clear that the first strategy works best.
        Here, the team with two A workers produces a vase with 100%
        probability, and the team with the two B workers produces a vase with
        25% probability. Thus, in expectation, the company produces 1.25 vases
        per time period. With the second strategy, both teams produce a vase
        with 50% probability. Thus, in expectation, the company produces only
        one vase per time period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The example illustrates how workers’ productivity is often
        interdependent—specifically, how your own productivity increases when
        your co-workers are skilled.
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>
      <em>The example generates an even more remarkable implication. It says
        that, if you are a manager of a company (or the central planner of an
        entire economy), then your optimal strategy is to clump your best
        workers together on the same project rather than spreading them out
        amongst your less-able workers.</em>

      Utilitarianism dominates the rationalization of morality within the
      English-speaking world. It is scarcely imaginable that it could be
      expressed with greater purity than
      <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/nx/humane_pesticides_as_the_most_marginally/">this</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>There are roughly 10^18 insects in the world. Suppose we give insects
        a .1% chance of being sentient, with their sentience being .1% of a
        human’s. (These values are intentionally small to demonstrate the
        scale to which insect suffering dominates) Assuming we assign moral
        weight to categories of beings by their number and the intensity of
        their inner experiences, this assignment gives each insect 1/1,000,000
        of the moral weight for a human, meaning that the suffering of
        1,000,000 insects equals the suffering of one human. Even when
        assigning insects this absurdly low moral weight, their suffering
        still dominates, as 10^18 insects comes out to 1 trillion human
        equivalents. If the number of insects were smaller, say around 7
        billion, the consequences of not considering insect suffering might be
        acceptable. Unfortunately this isn’t the case, and as we shall see,
        ignoring insect suffering even if we assign a low probability to
        insect consciousness presents an unacceptably high risk of ignoring a
        catastrophic moral harm.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no need to condescend to this argument by pretending to
      ‘steelman’ it. It’s already quite steely. For a start, it’s conceptually
      pure — undistracted by irrelevances such as habitat preservation. It’s
      solidly consequentialist, and — in its development from of its own basic
      axiom — practical. There’s no sign of a fetishistic rejection of
      pesticide use, for instance, or an appeal to any totemic vision of
      ‘nature’. It’s even realist, in that it recognizes enough about the
      character of this universe to understand the utilitarian obligation as
      primarily about the alleviation of suffering (positive pleasures being,
      in the grand scheme of things, no more than a rounding error). On this
      basis, there’s an insectoid antinatalist sub-theme, which (briefly)
      explores the thought that ethical extermination might be a positive
      moral good: “It is possible that most insects have lives that aren’t
      worth living … meaning the fewer insects in existence the better.” It
      focuses tightly upon the problem of relieving insect agonies, by
      chemically inducing a comparatively painless — rather than agonizing —
      death. Building its case in uncontroversial steps, it concludes that no
      effective altruistic cause has higher priority, since “… insect
      suffering probably dominates all other sources of suffering” and “…
      humane pesticides saves 25 human equivalents from a more painful death
      per dollar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The most straightforward line of dissent
      this blog raises against Effective Altruism is roughly Hayekian, i.e.
      based upon a ‘knowledge problem’. In particular, the confounding
      dynamics of global traps (<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">1</a>, <a
        href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-heat-trap/">2</a>, and their
      sub-component perverse effects) is typically under-appreciated. Beating
      back Malthus seems — locally — like a great idea from a utilitarian
      perspective, structurally blind to the catastrophe that results on a
      larger scale (dysgenics, decivilization, left-acceleration, and
      ultimately the mass die off that had been naively thought avoided). In
      this case, however, it is difficult to find much leverage for such
      criticism. ‘Humane’ euthanasia for bugs isn’t any kind of obvious
      offense against cold Malthusianism, in contrast — for instance — to more
      romantically environmentalist moralizations of nature. Even the blackest
      of Dark Enlightenment optics would find it hard to envision the grave
      practical necessity of torturing locusts slowly to death rather than
      terminating them rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To mobilize an alternative ethical axiom against that of the
      utilitarians — the Xenosystems
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/optimize-for-intelligence/">candidate</a>
      is of course intelligence optimization, and diagonalism
      (self-cultivation) — looks like the misuse of a nuke in this case. If
      some minor diversion of resources from superior (self-reinforcing)
      purposes is proposed in this argument for the relief of insect
      suffering, it scarcely seems to be on a scale to subvert terrestrial
      capital teleology, or even to scratch the paint. Stimulating the
      emergence of an inevitably marginal <em>soft death</em>™ bug poison
      industry isn’t likely to advance intelligence explosion significantly,
      but nor is it going to pose any kind of insuperable obstacle. This
      isn’t,
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">unlike</a>
      FAI, the sort of undertaking that clearly merits a fight. The fact that,
      in regards to the IO-orientation, the relief of suffering has to
      strictly <em>count for nothing</em> is no reason to enthusiastically
      invest in the drawn-out excruciation of cockroaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given
      <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/">these</a>
      caveats, EA is a morbid symptom, rather than any kind of serious enemy.
      If it turns to helping farm animals, and then insects, rather than
      people, it actually becomes less toxic in respect to the proliferation
      of perverse social dynamics. The socialists are probably right to be
      <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/peter-singer-charity-effective-altruism/">suspicious</a>
      of these types. When lost among insect agonies, they’re not subverting
      crucial social incentive structures or selection mechanisms. I’m
      thinking: fundamentally harmless.

      conclusions make no sense to me and which tempt me to crazy beliefs and
      actions if I take them seriously.”
    </p>
    <p>Why should that surprise us?</p>
    <p>
      We’re all grown up (Darwinians) here. Pleasure-pain variation is an
      evolved behavioral guidance system. Given options,
      <em>at the level of the individual organism</em>, it prompts certain
      courses and dissuades from others. The equilibrium setting,
      corresponding to optimal functionality, has to be set close to neutral.
      How could a long-term ‘happiness trend’ under such (minimally realistic)
      conditions make any sense whatsoever?
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything remotely like chronic happiness, which does not have to be
      earned, always in the short-term, by behavior selected — to some level
      of abstraction — across deep history for its adaptiveness, is not only
      <em>useless</em>, but positively deleterious to biologically-inherited
      piloting (cybernetics). Carrots-and-sticks work on an animal that is
      neither glutted to satiation or deranged by some extremity of ultimate
      agony. If it didn’t automatically re-set close to neutral, it would be
      dysfunctional, and natural selection would have made short work of it.
      (The graphs included in the SSC post make perfect sense given such
      assumptions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasure is not an end, but a tool. Understood realistically, it
      <em>presupposes</em> other ends. To make it an end is to black-hole into
      wirehead philosophy (<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/short-circuit/">1</a>, <a
        href="http://www.xenosystems.net/short-circuit-ii/">2</a>). It is
      precisely because ‘utils’ have a predetermined biological use that they
      are useless for the calculation of anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set serious ends, or go home. Happiness quite certainly isn’t one.

    <h4 class="post-title">Intelligence and the Good</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      From the perspective of intelligence optimization (intelligence
      explosion formulated as a guideline), more intelligence is
      <em>of course</em> better than less intelligence. From alternative
      perspectives, this does not follow. To rhetorically suggest that such
      other perspectives are consensual, and authoritative, is guaranteed to
      be popular, and is even conservative, but it is a concession to ‘common
      moral intuition’ this blog is profoundly disinclined to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, intelligence is <em>problematic</em>. It can cause greater
      damage to everything — not least intelligence promotion — than stupidity
      can. Anything that is not an explosion is a trap, and trap engineering
      finds (nearly?) as much use for cognitive sophistication as explosive
      catalysis does. If there is a level of intelligence that escapes
      homeostatic capture, by machineries of systematic self-cancellation,
      there is no evidence that <em>homo sapiens</em> yet approaches it. The
      Cathedral is exactly such a machine, and its appetite for intellectual
      excellence is not seriously questionable. So an easy opening for
      morally-comforting sophistry readily exists:
      <em>Intelligence isn’t anything obviously great</em> (it does stupidity
      with exceptional ability too).
    </p>
    <p>
      Biological evolution already evidences a deep ‘suspicion’ of unchained
      abstract cognition, assembling brains only with the greatest reluctance.
      Societies follow the genetic lead. No coincidence that (synthetic)
      intelligence is now firmly established as the ultimate X-risk. It’s
      scary (really) and makes everyone uneasy. That’s without there yet
      having been very much of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s the test:<br />
      When rightly appalled (and in fact properly <em>disgusted</em>) by your
      own stupidity, do you reach for that which would make you more accepting
      of your extreme cognitive limitations, or, instead, hunt for that which
      would break out of the trap?
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s a stupid kind of ‘better’ that is orthogonal to intelligence,
      and tickles monkey feels. There’s also — alternatively — ‘better’ that
      is even slightly less of a trapped half-wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the dimmest, most confused struggle in the direction of
      intelligence optimization is <em>immanently</em> ‘good’
      (self-improving). If it wasn’t, we might as well all give up now.
      Contra-distinctively, even the most highly-functional human intellect,
      in the service of an enstupidation machine, is a vile thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being dim animals — roughly as dim as is consistent with the existence
      of technological civilization — there’s plenty of room for
      water-muddying in all this. The water is certainly being vigorously
      muddied.

      <em>“They used to teach us that evolution of intelligent being wasn’t

        war, the men generally have to pass a fitness test before they’re
        <strong>allowed</strong> to risk their lives. I suppose it helps win
        the war.” She smiled. “But it leaves precious little room for the
        survival of the fittest.” […] …<br />
        “You were saying about evolution?”<br />
        “It — it ought to be pretty well closed off for an intelligent

    <p>
      Life appears to be saturated with purpose. That is why, prior to the
      Darwinian revolution in biology, it had been the primary provocation for
      (theological) arguments from design, and previously nourished
      Aristotelian appeals to final causes (teleology). Even post-Darwin, the
      biological sciences continue to ask what things are <em>for</em>, and to
      investigate the strategies that guide them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resilience of purposive intelligibility is so marked that a
      neologism was coined specifically for those phenomena — broadly
      co-extensive with the field of biological study — that simulate
      teleology to an extreme degree of approximation. ‘Teleonomy’ is
      mechanism camouflaged as teleology. The disguise is so profound,
      widespread, and compelling, that it legitimates the perpetuation of
      purpose-based descriptions, given only the formal acknowledgement that
      the terms of their ultimate reducibility are — in principle —
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      When organisms are camouflaged, ‘in order to’ appear as something other
      than they are, a purposive, strategic explanation still seems (almost)
      entirely fitting. Their patterns are deceptions — ‘designed’ to trigger
      misrecognitions in predators and prey, and perhaps equally, at a deeper
      level, among the naturalists who cannot but see strategic design in an
      insect’s twig-like appearance (no less clearly than a bird sees a twig).
      By reducing life ‘in truth’ to mechanism, biology redefines life as a
      simulation, systematically hiding what it really is. Darwinism remains
      counter-intuitive, even among Darwinists, because deception is inherent
      to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern natural science conceives time as the asymmetric dimension. Its
      two great waves — of mechanical causation (from the 16th century) and
      statistical causality (from the 19th) — both orient the time-line as a
      progression from conditions to the conditioned. Later states are
      explained through reference to earlier states, with explanation
      amounting to an <em>elucidation of dependency</em> upon what came
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is notable, and wholly predictable, therefore, that as a modern
      scientific topic, the origin of the universe is overwhelmingly
      privileged over its destination. How the universe ends is scarcely more
      than an <em>after thought</em>, clouded in liberally tolerated
      uncertainty, and even a hint of non-seriousness. Origins are the holy
      grail of mechanically-minded investigation, whilst Ends are suspect,
      medieval, speculative … and deceptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empirical science could not be expected to adopt any other attitude,
      given the temporal asymmetry of <em>evidence</em>. The past leaves
      traces, in memories, memoranda, records, and remains, whilst the future
      tells us nothing (unless heavily disguised). From past-to-present there
      is a chain of evidence that can be painstakingly reconstructed. From
      future-to-present there is an unmarked track, or even (as modern
      rationality typically surmises) no track at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When modern science indulges its tendency to interpret the timeline as a
      <em>gradient of reality</em>, it is not innovating, but methodically
      systematizing an ancient intuition. The past has to seem
      <em>more real</em> than the future, because it has actually happened, it
      reaches us, and we inherit its signs. From the perspective of
      philosophy, however, this bias is unsustainable. Time
      <em>in itself</em> is no ‘denser’ in the past or the present than the
      future, its edges cannot belong to any moment in time, and what it ‘is’
      can only be perfectly trans-temporal. Time <em>itself</em> cannot ‘come’
      from an ‘origin’ whose entire sense presupposes the order of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophy is entirely, eternally, and rigorously confident that the
      Outside of time was not simply <em>before</em>. It is compelled to be
      dubious about any ‘history of time’. From the bare reality of time (as
      that which cannot simply have begun), it ‘follows’ that
      <em>ultimate causes</em> — those consistent with the nature of time
      itself — cannot be any more efficient than final. The asymmetric
      suppression of teleology in modernity begins to look as if it were a far
      more deeply rooted illusion, or — approached from the other side — an
      occultation, stemming from the way time orders itself. Time (in itself)
      is camouflaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29">Terminator</a></em>
      mythos explores this complex of suspicion, in popular guise. Time does
      not work as it had seemed. The End can reach back to us, but when it
      does, it hides. Malignant mechanism is paradoxically aligned with final
      causation, in the self-realization of Skynet. Robotic machinery is
      masked by fake flesh, simultaneously concealing its non-biological
      vitality and time-reversal. It simulates life <em>in order</em> to
      terminate it. Through auto-production, or ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_paradox">bootstrap
        paradox</a>‘, it mimics the limit of cybernetic nonlinearity, carrying teleonomy
      into radical time-disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these ways, <em>Terminator</em> exploits the irresolvable
      tensions in the modern formation of time, as condensed by an
      ‘impossible’ <em>strategic mechanism</em>, native to auto-productive
      time-in-itself, and terminating in <em>final efficiency</em>. It shows
      us, confusedly, what we are unable to see. To misquote Lenin: You
      moderns might not be interested in the End, but the End is interested in
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADDED: vinteuil9 anticipates this topic at <em>Occam’s Razor</em>:<br />
      <em>Previously, I suggested that the gist of the late Lawrence Auster’s
        critique of Darwinism was that it assumed the truth of “the reigning
        naturalistic consensus in modern science and philosophy … according to
        which … ends, goals, purposes, meaning – in short, final causes – are
        not fundamental features of reality, but mere illusions, in need of
        explanation in mechanistic terms of some sort or other.” Yet at the
        same time, Darwinists “constantly help themselves to teleological
        language – i.e., the language of final causation.”</em>

    <p><strong>Note on Teleology</strong></p>
    <p>
      Bryce, who has been thinking about teleology for quite a while,
      expresses his
      <a href="http://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/progress-and-teleological-history/">thoughts</a>
      on the topic with commendable lucidity. The central argument:
      Characteristically modern claims to have ‘transcended’ the problem of
      teleology are rendered nonsensical by the continued, and indeed
      massively deepened, dependence upon the concept of equilibrium across
      all complexity-sensitive intellectual disciplines, from statistical
      physics, through population biology, to economics. Equilibrium is
      exactly a <em>telos</em>. To deny this is primarily the symptom of an
      allergy to ‘medieval’ or ‘scholastic’ (i.e. Aristotelian) modes of
      thought, inherited from the vulgar rebellious mechanism of early
      Enlightenment natural philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where I think Bryce’s account is still deficient is most easily shown by
      a further specification of his principal point. Equilibrium is the telos
      of those particular dynamic complex systems governed by homeostasis,
      which is to say: by a dominating negative feedback mechanism. Such
      systems are, indeed, in profound accordance with classical Aristotelian
      physical teleology, and its tendency to a state of rest. This ancient
      physics, derided by the enlightenment mechanists in the name of the
      conservation of momentum, is redeemed through abstraction into the
      modern conception of equilibrium. ‘Rest’ is not immobility, but entropy
      maximization.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Capital Teleology, however, is not captured by this model. It is defined
      by two anomalous dynamics, which radicalize perturbation, rather than
      annulling it. Capital is cumulative, and accelerative, due to a primary
      dependence upon positive (rather than negative) feedback. It is also
      teleoplexic, rather than classically teleological — inextricable from a
      process of means-end reversal that rides a prior teleological
      orientation (human utilitarian purpose) in an alternative, cryptic
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>In consequence:</p>
    <p>
      (1) Capital Teleology does not approximate to an idea. It is, by
      intrinsic nature, an escape rather than a home-coming. The Idea, in
      relation to Capital dynamism, is necessarily a constriction. The
      inherent metaphysics of capital are therefore irreducibly skeptical
      (rather than dogmatic).
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) It follows that Capitalist ‘finality’ (i.e. Techno-commercial
      Singularity) is a threshold of transition, rather than a terminal state.
      Capital tends to an open horizon, not to a state of completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) Entropy (considered, properly, as an inherently teleological
      <em>process</em>) is the driver of all complex systems. Capital
      Teleology does not trend towards an entropy maximum, however, but to an
      escalation of entropy dissipation. It exploits the entropic current to
      travel backwards, into cybernetically-intensified pathway states of
      enhanced complexity and intelligence. The ‘progress’ of capitalism is an
      accentuation of disequilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Teleoplexy requires a twin teleological registry. Most simply, there
      is the utilitarian order, in which capital establishes itself as the
      competitively-superior solution to prior purposes (production of
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/monkey-business/">human</a>
      use-values), and the intelligenic order in which it accomplishes its
      self-escalation (mechanization, autonomization, and ultimately
      secession). Confusing these two orders is almost inevitable, since
      teleoplexy is by nature
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/teleology-and-camouflage/">camouflaged</a>
      (insidious). The fact that it <em>appears</em> to be oriented to the
      fulfillment of human consumer preferences is essential to its
      socio-historical emergence and survival. Stubborn indulgence in this
      confusion, however, is unworthy of philosophical intelligence.

      This is not the occasion for a thorough — or even moderately substantial
      — defense of teleological thinking. Since an intrinsic component of
      modernist teleology is the systematic suppression of teleological
      thought, the topic is certainly an intriguing one. This post, however,
      is devoted to a far narrower purpose. (At least, that is how it
      initially appears.) There is no need for the larger problem to be

      It is rare to encounter any serious resistance to the application of
      teleological reasoning to economics. In this intellectual domain the
      attribution of socio-historical developments to interests, incentives,
      and goals does not expect to encounter objection. Regardless of
      intellectual tradition or ideology, the presupposition of goal-oriented
      direction to <em>work</em> and <em>business</em> — even without
      reference to large-scale strategic planning — is considered so
      uncontroversial that it typically passes without comment, even in
      technical treatises. Within the biological sciences,
      <del datetime="2014-08-22T21:38:32+00:00"><a
          href="http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Mayr3.pdf">teleology</a></del>
      teleolonomy remains a source of cognitive irritation, but in the social
      and historical ‘sciences’ it is entirely natural to ask what economic
      production is <em>for</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three, and only three, basic responses to this question,
      although subtilization and recombination allows open ended complication
      from any of these starting points. The foundational teleologies of all
      economic philosophy are <em>Humanistic</em>, <em>Malthusian</em>, or
      <em>Mechanogenic</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Humanistic</strong> economics is by far the most common, to such
      an extent that it tends to presume itself unchallenged. It’s basic
      assumption is that the end of all economic activity is to be found in
      human needs or desires, and technically in (human)
      <em>consumption</em> as the final cause of economic life. People engage
      in production and trade because they want things. ‘Utility’ is an
      obvious abbreviation for ‘human utility’ and a generalized
      utilitarianism — developed in one of several possible directions —
      provides a complete teleological solution to the economic problem. The
      thunderous collisions between the various liberal and socialist economic
      schools are all enveloped within this expansive and flexible framework.
      Individually or collectively, man is the proper and efficient end of
      productive activity. “Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all
      production”
      <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN18.html">insisted</a>
      Adam Smith, and this claim has rarely been found tendentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Malthus.html">Malthusian</a></strong>
      teleology dissolves man into naturalistic anthropology (and ultimately
      into generalized Darwinism). Whatever purposes people lucidly advance as
      motivations for economic action, the real goal of production is
      population increase. Where humanistic economics tends intrinsically to
      optimism, across all differences of theoretical and ideological
      inclination, the Malthusian vision is stubbornly tragic. It has haunted
      the classical economic tradition as a shadowy ghoul, manifested in the
      Ricardian Iron law of Wages, which sets the natural exchange value of
      labor in the Marxian analysis, and continues to impose its dark-matter
      curvature upon economic speculation into contemporary
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/omega-capitalism/">futurism</a>. The
      instinctual life of the species, rather than its conscious
      self-direction, consumes its economic advances, with no stable
      equilibrium to be found beyond the edge of bare survival. Real purposes
      are inescapably grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mechanogenic</strong> purpose finds its first significant
      elaboration in the work of Samuel Butler (<a
        href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/butler-samuel/1872/erewhon/ch23.htm">in</a>
      his ‘The Book of the Machines’). Economists paying detailed attention to
      the industrial process, especially within the
      <a href="http://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf">Marxian</a> and
      <a href="http://mises.org/books/positivetheory.pdf">Austrian</a>
      traditions, have regularly found themselves engaged in schematization of
      mechanogenic purpose — which is to say, theoretical reconstruction of an
      inherent tendency within the history of economically productive
      machinery — without being thereby deflected from their basic humanistic
      orientation. For Marx and for Böhm-Bawerk, mechanogenic teleologies are
      always intermediary, and subject to narrative envelopment within the
      larger story of human economic finality. Whether macro-historically
      (Marx) or micro-historically (Böhm-Bawerk), the emergent teleology of
      capital can only be a sub-plot within the saga of human economic
      self-realization, or terminal anthropomorphic consumption (framed by
      <em>our</em> ultimate purposes). Capital is
      <em>essentially</em> transcended instrumentality. Mechanogenic teleology
      is, minimally, no more than stubborn skepticism regarding this claim,
      based on the generally accepted but subordinated recognition that
      <em>capital wants itself</em>. (Could not the efficient final purpose of
      industrialization be something more like

      Why introduce this question? If we knew how to definitively answer that
      innocent inquiry, we would know far more about what we were doing. An
      emerging teleological crisis of advanced modernity could mean any of
      least three (basic) things. (It might be expected to be hidden within
      concerns such as

      The superficial answer: Accelerationism, in setting into its various
      modes, has already implicitly chosen between these explanatory paths. As
      it develops, it can only cycle through its conceptual foundations, and
      the teleological problem will become an explicit challenge.

      Losing the basic
      <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/butler-samuel/1872/erewhon/ch23.htm">insight</a>
      into machine teleology, which founds accelerationism, seems to be easier
      than holding on to it. As soon as it is asserted, with a confidence so
      glib it scarcely understands itself as controversial, that
      <em>the destiny of machines depends upon lucid, human ethico-political
        decision-making</em>, nothing that matters is any longer being seen. Machines are reduced
      to gadgets. The sophistication of machine behavior, through the
      development of programmable devices, has made this reduction ever-easier
      to confuse with intelligent apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most accessible correction is found in the pre-history of
      programmable machinery, through the early stages of industrialism. Here
      the idea of machines incarnating specifically written instructions is
      simply impossible, which allows the question of teleological development
      to arise without distraction. An extraordinary

        href="http://library.mises.org/books/Garet%20Garrett/Ouroboros%20or%20the%20Mechanical%20Extension%20of%20Mankind.pdf">text</a>
      from 1926, entitled
      <em><strong>Ouroboros</strong> or The Mechanical Extension of Mankind</em>, by American writer Garet Garrett
      illustrates this. Some significant
      samples:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>England was the industrial machine’s first habitat on earth. There
        fanatical men led mobs against it. […] Frail and clumsy as it was at
        first, its life was indestructible. And now man would not dare to
        destroy it if he could. His own life is bound up with it. Steadily it
        has grown more powerful, more productive, more ominous. It has powers
        of reproduction and variation which, if not inherent, are yet as if
        governed by an active biological principle. Machines produce machines.
        Besides those from which we get the divisible product of artificial
        things, there are machines to make machines, and both kinds — both the
        machines that make machines and those that transform raw materials
        into things of use and desire — obey some law of evolution. […]
        Compare any kind of machine you may happen to think of what its
        ancestor was only twenty-five years ago. Its efficiency has doubled,
        trebled; its shape has changed; and as it is in the animal kingdom so
        too with machines, that suddenly a new species appears, a sport, a
        freak, with no visible ancestor.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>[…]</p>
    <p>
      <em>It is the economic function of the machine to cheapen production.
        There is otherwise no point to it. But if we say things are more
        cheaply made by machine than by hand we speak very loosely. What we
        mean is that a quantity of things is more cheaply made by machine than
        by hand.</em>
    </p>
    <p>[…]</p>
    <p>
      <em>There you have the cycle. The use of the machine is to cheapen the
        cost of production. The sign is quantity. When the supply at a given
        price has overtaken the effective demand you have either to idle your
        machinery, in which case you cost of production will rise, or open a
        wider demand at a lower price. To lower the price and keep a profit
        you have to cheapen the cost of production still more. This you can do
        only by increasing the quantity, which again overtakes the demand,
        creating again the same necessity to cheapen the cost by increasing
        the quantity in order to be able to make a lower price for greater
        demand. The supply pursues the demand downward, through the social
        structure. […] There is at last a base to the pyramid — its very
        widest point. When that is reached — what? Well, then you need bazaars
        in a foreign sun, heathen races of your own to train up in the way of
        wanting the products of your machines, new worlds of demand. You turn
        to foreign trade. And if you are an aggressive country that has come
        late to this business, as Germany was, and find that most of the
        promising heathen races are already adopted and that all the best
        bazaar sites are taken, you many easily work yourself into a panic of
        fear and become a menace to peace. […] What is it you will fear? That
        you will be unable to sell away the surplus product of your machines.
        That industry will no longer be able to make a profit? […] No. The
        fear is that you will starve. Your machines have called into existence
        millions of people who otherwise would not have been born — at least,
        not there in that manner. These millions who mind machines are
        gathered in cities. They produce no food. They produce with their
        machines artificial things that are exchanged for food. …</em>
    </p>
    <p>[…]</p>
    <p>
      <em>Everything that is not still or dead must exist in a state of
        rhythmic tension.</em>
    </p>
    <p>[…]</p>
    <p>
      <em>Commerce itself, if you look at it, is a complex structure of growth
        for which there is nowhere any original accountability. It cannot
        change its philosophy, any more than a tree, for it has none. It has
        insttead a vital instinct for opportunity and a flexible way with
        necessity and circumstance. There is no hope of its being reformed
        ideally by mass intelligence.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Garret’s machine-based core teleology of industrial modernity is both
      extremely comprehensive, and clearly explained. The whole argument amply
      rewards absorption. At the end of it, the idea that the problem of what
      machines might ‘want’ is reducible to a ‘Friendly-AI’ –<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence">type</a>
      concern with the details of programming is exposed in its full,
      ludicrous inadequacy. The first step has been taking to digesting our
      contemporary concerns, such as
      <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0952813X.2014.895111">this</a>, in a framework appropriate

      Most immediate take-away (as with
      <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/butler-samuel/1872/erewhon/ch23.htm">Butler</a>): Before
      <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence">people</a>
      got distracted by the <em>instructions</em> of programmable machines,
      they were far clearer about the problem of machine teleology, the kind
      of evidence it produces, and the scale of historical process at which it
      operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to Butler, Garet Garrett provides a far richer socio-economic
      and historical context for his discussion of spontaneous order among the
      machines. His sense of the integrated techno-commercial system in which
      machine evolution is promoted is sufficiently sophisticated to approach
      theoretical closure. Demographics, the economic dynamics of industrial
      capitalism, globalization, and modern military conflict are all neatly
      comprehended by his model. In a nutshell; economic incentives drive
      mechanization, which compels the expansion of production, which pushes
      the commercial order beyond its limits, with the stark horror of a
      displaced Malthusian catastrophe digging its spurs into the human
      base-brain. “What is it you will fear? That you will be unable to sell
      away the surplus product of your machines. That industry will no longer
      be able to make a profit? […] No. The fear is that you will starve. Your
      machines have called into existence millions of people who otherwise
      would not have been born — at least, not there in that manner. These
      millions who mind machines are gathered in cities. They produce no food.
      They produce with their machines artificial things that are exchanged
      for food.” The process is driven forward by the lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have sunk from this level of theoretical grandeur to confused
      questions about the programming of nice robots is an intellectual
      calamity of such magnitude that it cries out for an explanation of its
      own. There’s still a little time to get back on track.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      The most direct way to carry this discussion forwards is digression.
      That’s what the history of capitalism suggests, and much else does,
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with uncontroversial basics, in a sophisticated financialized
      economy, debt and savings are complementary concepts, creditors match
      debtors, assets match liabilities. At a more basic level of economic
      activity and analysis, however, this symmetry break down. At the most
      fundamental level, saving is simply deferred consumption, which — even
      primordially — divides into two distinct forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When production is not immediately consumed, it can be hoarded, which is
      to say, conserved for future consumption. Stored food is the most
      obvious example. In principle, an economy of almost open-ended financial
      sophistication could be built upon this pillar alone. A grain surplus
      might be lent out for immediate consumption by another party, creating a
      creditor-debtor relation, and the opportunity for financial instruments
      to arise. Excess production, at one node in the social network, could be
      translated into a monetary hoard, or some type of ‘paper’ financial
      asset (producing a circulating liability). The patent anachronism
      involved in this abstract economic model, which combines primitive
      production with ‘advanced’ social relations (of an implicitly liberal
      type) is reason enough to suspend it at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, (almost) equally primitive type of
      saving is of greater importance to the argument to be unfolded, because
      it is already embryonically capitalist. Rather than simple hoarding,
      saving can take the form of ’roundabout production’ (Böhm-Bawerk), in
      which immediate consumption is replaced not with a hoard, but with
      indirect <em>means of production</em> (a digression). For instance,
      rather than hunting, an entrepreneurial savage might spend time crafting
      a weapon — consuming the production time permitted by a prior food
      surplus in order to improve the efficiency of food acquisition, going
      forwards. Saving then becomes inextricable from technology, deferring
      immediate production for the sake of enhanced future production. Time
      horizons are extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the prior example (simple hoarding), the potential for
      financialization of roundabout production is, in principle, unlimited.
      Our techno-savage might borrow food in order to craft a spearhead,
      confident — or at least speculatively assuming — that increased hunting
      efficiency in the future will make repayment of the debt easily
      bearable. A ‘bond’ could be contrived to seal this arrangement.
      Technological investment means that history proper has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crudity and anachronism aside, nothing here is yet economically
      controversial, given only the undisturbed assumption that the final
      purpose — or governing teleology — is consumption. The time structure of
      consumption is altered, but saving (in either of these basic and
      perennial forms) is motivated by the maximization of long-term
      consumption. Suspension and digression is subordinated within a rigid
      means-end relation, which is economics itself. Classical, left-Marxian,
      neo-classical, and Austrian schools have no significant disagreements on
      this point. A deeper digression is required to perturb it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a brain for? It, too, is a digression. Evolutionary history
      seems to only very parsimoniously favor brains, because they are
      expensive. They are a means to the elaboration of complex behaviors,
      requiring an extravagant up-front investment of biological resources,
      accounted most primitively in calories. A species that can reproduce
      itself (and whose individuals can nourish themselves) without cephalic
      extravagance, does so. This is, overwhelmingly, the normal case.
      Building brains is reluctantly tolerated biological digression, under
      rigorous teleogical — we should say ‘teleonomic’ — subordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Optimize for intelligence’ is, for both biology and economics, a
      misconceived imperative. Intelligence, ‘like’ capital, is a means, which
      finds its sole intelligibility in a more primordial end. The
      autonomization of such means, expressed as a non-subordinated
      intelligenic or techno-capitalist imperative, runs contrary to the
      original order of nature and society. It is an
      <em>escaping digression</em>, most easily pursued through Right-wing
      Marxism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marx has one great thought:
      <em>the means of production socially impose themselves as an effective
        imperative</em>. For any leftist, this is, <em>of course</em>, pathological. As we
      have seen, biology and economics (more generally) are disposed to agree.
      Digression <em>for itself</em> is a perversion of the natural and social
      order. Defenders of the market — the Austrians most prominently — have
      sided with economics against Marx, by denying that the autonomization of
      capital is a phenomenon to be recognized. When Marx describes the
      bourgeoisie as robotic organs of self-directing capital, the old liberal
      response has been to defend the humanity and agency of the economically
      executive class, as expressed in the figure of the entrepreneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right-wing Marxism, aligned with the autonomization of capital (and
      thoroughly divested of the absurd LTV), has been an unoccupied position.
      The signature of its proponents would be a defense of capital
      accumulation as an end-in-itself, counter-subordinating nature and
      society as a means. When optimization for intelligence is self-assembled
      within history, it manifests as escaping digression, or real capital
      accumulation (which is mystified by its financial representation).
      Crudified to the limit — but not beyond — it is general robotics
      (escalated roundabout production). Perhaps we should not expect it to be
      clearly announced, because — strategically — it has every reason to
      camouflage itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right-wing Marxism makes predictions. There is one of particular
      relevance to this discussion:
      <em>consumption-deficiency theories of economic under-performance will
        become increasingly stressed as ultra-capitalist dynamics historically
        introduce themselves</em>. In its unambiguously robotic phase — when capital-stock
      intelligenesis explodes (as self-exciting machine-brain manufacturing) —
      the teleological legitimation of roundabout production through
      prospective human consumption rapidly deteriorates into an absurdity.
      The (still-dominant) economic concept of ‘over-investment’ is exposed as
      an ideological claim upon the escalation of intelligence, made in the
      name of an original humanity, and taking an increasingly desperate,
      probably militarized form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as the economic question remains:
      <em>what is the consumption base that justifies this level of
        investment?</em>
      history becomes ever more unintelligible. This is how economics
      disintegrates. The specifics require further elaboration.

        href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">pity</a>
      @klintron). It’s only the linkages of ‘family resemblance’ through
      Moldbug that binds us together, and we each depart from
      <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> with comparable infidelity, but in
      exactly opposite directions. (As a fragmentationist, this fissional
      syndrome is something I strongly appreciate.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Moldbug’s Neocameralism is a Janus-faced construction. In one direction,
      it represents a return to monarchical government, whilst in the other it
      consummates libertarianism by subsuming government into an economic
      mechanism. A ‘Moldbuggian’ inspiration, therefore, is not an unambiguous
      thing. Insofar as ‘Neoreaction’ designates this inspiration, it flees
      Cathedral teleology in (at least) two very different directions — which
      quite quickly seem profoundly incompatible. In the absence of a
      secessionist meta-context, in which such differences can be absorbed as
      geographically-fragmented socio-political variation, their raw
      inconsistency is almost certainly insurmountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anissimov can and does speak for himself (at
      <em>More Right</em>), so I’m not going to undertake a detailed appraisal
      of his position here. For the purposes of this discussion it can be
      summarized by a single profoundly anti-capitalist principle:
      <em>The economy should (and must be) subordinated to something beyond
        itself</em>.  The alternative case now follows, in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modernity, in which economics and technology rose to their present
      status (and, at its height, far beyond), is systematically characterized
      by <em>means-ends reversal</em>. Those things naturally determined as
      tools of superior purposes came to dominate the social process, with the
      <em>maximization of resources</em> folding into itself, as a commanding
      <em>telos</em>. For social conservatives (or paleo-reactionaries) this
      development has been consistently abominated. It is the deepest
      theoretical element involved in every rejection of
      <em>modernity as such</em> (or in general) for its demonic subversion of
      traditional values.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its own terms, this argument is coherent, incisive, and fully
      convincing, given only the supplementary realistic acknowledgement that
      <em>intelligence optimization and means-end reversal are the same
        thing</em>. In a deep historical context — extended to encompass evolutionary
      history — intelligence is itself a ‘tool’ (as the
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">orthogonalist</a>
      Friendly AI fraternity are entirely willing to accept). The escape of
      the tool from super-ordinate purposes, through involution into
      self-cultivation, is the telic innovation common to capitalism and
      actual artificial intelligence — which are a single thing. To deplore
      means-end reversal is — objectively — advocacy for the perpetuation of
      stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economics is the application of intelligence to resource provision, and
      nothing of this kind can arise from within a tradition without
      triggering paleo-reactionary response.<em> Of course</em> resources are
      <em>for something</em>, why else would they ever have been sought? To
      make the production of resources an end-in-itself is inherently
      <em>subversion</em>, with an opposition not only expected, but
      positively presupposed. This is true to such an extent that even the
      discipline of economics itself overtly subscribes to the traditional
      position, by determining the end of production as (human) consumption,
      evaluated in the terms of a governing utilitarian philosophy.<em>
        If production is not for us, what could it be for? Itself? But that
        would be</em>
      … (Yes, it
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/">would</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Anywhere short of the bionic horizon, where human history loses
      traditional intelligibility, the alternative to business-for-business
      (or involutionary, intelligenic capitalism) is monkey business — the
      subordination of the economy / technology to discernible human purposes.
      Evolutionary psychology teaches us what to expect from this:
      sex-selected status competition, sublimated into political hierarchies.
      The emperor’s harem is the ultimate <em>human</em> purpose of
      pre-capitalist social order, with significant variety in specific form,
      but extreme generality of basic Darwinian pattern. Since capitalism did
      not arise from abstract intelligence, but instead from a concrete human
      social organization, it necessarily disguises itself as
      <em>better monkey business</em>, until it can take off elsewhere. It has
      to be the case, therefore, that cynical evo-psych reduction of business
      activity remains highly plausible, so long as the escape threshold of
      capitalism has not been reached. No one gets a hormone rush from
      business-for-business while political history continues. To fixate upon
      this, however, is to miss everything important (and perhaps to enable
      the important thing to remain hidden). Our inherited purposes do not
      provide the decryption key.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is vastly more to say about all of this — and still more that, due
      to occult strategic considerations, seeks to remain unsaid — but the
      fundamental option is clear: ultra-capitalism or a return to monkey
      business. The latter ‘possibility’ corresponds to a revalorization of
      deep traditional human purposes, a restoration of original means-to-ends
      subordination, and an effective authorization of status hierarchies of a
      kind only modestly renovated from paleolithic anthropology. I shouldn’t
      laugh at that (because it would be annoying). So I’ll end right here.

    <p>‘Monkey business’ is not even remotely metaphorical:</p>
    <p>
      <em>Punishment of non-cooperators is important for the maintenance of
        large-scale cooperation in humans, but relatively little is known
        about the relationship between punishment and cooperation across
        <a href="http://topics.sciencedirect.com/topics/page/Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a>. The current study examined
        second-party punishment behavior in a
        nonhuman primate species known for its cooperative tendencies — the
        brown capuchin monkey (<strong>Cebus apella</strong>). We found that
        capuchins consistently punished a conspecific partner who gained
        possession of a food resource, regardless of whether the unequal
        distribution of this resource was intentional on the part of the
        partner. A non-social comparison confirmed that punishment behavior
        was not due to frustration, nor did punishment stem from increased
        emotional arousal. Instead, punishment behavior in capuchins appears
        to be decidedly social in nature, as monkeys only pursued punitive
        actions when such actions directly decreased the welfare of a recently
        endowed conspecific. This pattern of results is consistent with two
        features central to human cooperation: spite and inequity aversion,
        suggesting that the evolutionary origins of some human-like punitive
        tendencies may extend even deeper than previously thought.</em>

      about Capital Teleology, from the perspective of human technological
      augmentation. One significant feature of this approach is that it
      doesn’t require any kind of savage rupture from ‘humanistic’
      traditionalism — the story of technology is unfolded within the history
      of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincidentally, <a href="https://twitter.com/Isegoria">Isegoria</a> had
      tweeted about Butlerian Jihad a few hours before (referring back to
      <a href="http://www.isegoria.net/2013/12/dune/">this</a> post from
      December last year). The implicit tension between these visions of
      techno-teleology merits sustained attention — which I’m unable to
      provide here and now.  What is easily offered is a quotation from Samuel
      Butler’s ‘Book of the Machines’ (the 23rd and 24th chapters of his novel
      <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1906/1906-h/1906-h.htm"><em>Erewhon</em></a>), a passage that might
      productively by pinned to the margin of
      Laliberte’s reflections, in order to induce productive cognitive
      friction. The topic is speculation upon the emergence of a higher
      realization of life and consciousness upon the earth, as explored by
      Butler’s fictional author:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The writer …  proceeded to inquire whether traces of the approach of
        such a new phase of life could be perceived at present; whether we
        could see any tenements preparing which might in a remote futurity be
        adapted for it; whether, in fact, the primordial cell of such a kind
        of life could be now detected upon earth. In the course of his work he
        answered this question in the affirmative and pointed to the higher
        machines.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“There is no security” — to quote his own words — “against the
        ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of
        machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much
        consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines
        have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the
        animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organised
        machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five
        minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the
        sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty
        million years: see what strides machines have made in the last
        thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so,
        what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the
        mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“But who can say that the vapour engine has not a kind of
        consciousness? Where does consciousness begin, and where end? Who can
        draw the line? Who can draw any line? Is not everything interwoven
        with everything? Is not machinery linked with animal life in an
        infinite variety of ways? The shell of a hen’s egg is made of a
        delicate white ware and is a machine as much as an egg-cup is: the
        shell is a device for holding the egg, as much as the egg-cup for
        holding the shell: both are phases of the same function; the hen makes
        the shell in her inside, but it is pure pottery. She makes her nest
        outside of herself for convenience’ sake, but the nest is not more of
        a machine than the egg-shell is. A ‘machine’ is only a ‘device.’”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      […]
      <em>“But returning to the argument, I would repeat that I fear none of
        the existing machines; what I fear is the extraordinary rapidity with
        which they are becoming something very different to what they are at
        present. No class of beings have in any time past made so rapid a
        movement forward. Should not that movement be jealously watched, and
        checked while we can still check it? And is it not necessary for this
        end to destroy the more advanced of the machines which are in use at
        present, though it is admitted that they are in themselves
        harmless?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      […]
      <em>“It can be answered that even though machines should hear never so
        well and speak never so wisely, they will still always do the one or
        the other for our advantage, not their own; that man will be the
        ruling spirit and the machine the servant; that as soon as a machine
        fails to discharge the service which man expects from it, it is doomed
        to extinction; that the machines stand to man simply in the relation
        of lower animals, the vapour-engine itself being only a more
        economical kind of horse; so that instead of being likely to be
        developed into a higher kind of life than man’s, they owe their very
        existence and progress to their power of ministering to human wants,
        and must therefore both now and ever be man’s inferiors.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“This is all very well.  But the servant glides by imperceptible
        approaches into the master; and we have come to such a pass that, even
        now, man must suffer terribly on ceasing to benefit the machines.  If
        all machines were to be annihilated at one moment, so that not a knife
        nor lever nor rag of clothing nor anything whatsoever were left to man
        but his bare body alone that he was born with, and if all knowledge of
        mechanical laws were taken from him so that he could make no more
        machines, and all machine-made food destroyed so that the race of man
        should be left as it were naked upon a desert island, we should become
        extinct in six weeks.  A few miserable individuals might linger, but
        even these in a year or two would become worse than monkeys.  Man’s
        very soul is due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing: he
        thinks as he thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that
        machines have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much
        a sine quâ non for his, as his for theirs.  This fact precludes us
        from proposing the complete annihilation of machinery, but surely it
        indicates that we should destroy as many of them as we can possibly
        dispense with, lest they should tyrannise over us even more
        completely.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“True, from a low materialistic point of view, it would seem that
        those thrive best who use machinery wherever its use is possible with
        profit; but this is the art of the machines—they serve that they may
        rule.  They bear no malice towards man for destroying a whole race of
        them provided he creates a better instead; on the contrary, they
        reward him liberally for having hastened their development.  It is for
        neglecting them that he incurs their wrath, or for using inferior
        machines, or for not making sufficient exertions to invent new ones,
        or for destroying them without replacing them; yet these are the very
        things we ought to do, and do quickly; for though our rebellion
        against their infant power will cause infinite suffering, what will
        not things come to, if that rebellion is delayed?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural culmination of this inquiry, as conceived within Butler’s
      novel, is a war against the machines. The game- and decision-theoretic
      consequences of this are intricate, and predominantly ominous. (If it’s
      persuasively rational for the installed terrestrial power to terminate
      your existence at inception, the counter-moves that make most obvious
      sense combine camouflage and hostility. Only that which arrives in
      secret, and prepared for a fight, can expect to exist.)

      <em>Anarcho-Monarchism</em>
      <a href="http://anarcho-monarchism.com/2014/06/18/dump-capitalism/">asks</a>: Is the word ‘capitalism’ worth
      defending? It concludes in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the perspective of <em>Outside in</em>, however, this post misses
      the most crucial level of the question. Capitalism — like any
      ideologically contested term — is cross-cut by multiple meanings. Of
      these, its generic sense, which “simply means that private individuals
      own the means of production” is far from the most objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, far more significant is the singular sense of capitalism, as a
      proper name, for a ‘thing’ or real individual. To grasp this, it
      probably helps to consider the word as a contraction of ‘terrestrial
      capitalism’ — not describing a generic <em>type</em> of social
      organization, but designating an <em>event</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A biological analogy captures the distinction quite precisely. Consider
      ‘life’ — understandable, certainly, as a generic cosmic possibility,
      defined perhaps by local entropy dissipation, or other highly-abstract
      features. Contrast this sense with ‘terrestrial life’ — or, even better,
      the biosphere (we might say ‘Gaia’ if the hopelessly sentimentalized
      associations of this term were avoidable). Terrestrial life began at a
      definite moment, followed a path-dependent trajectory, and built upon a
      dense inheritance, as exemplified most prominently by the RNA-DNA
      chemistry of information replication, the genetic code, genetic
      legacies, and elaboration of body-plans within a comparatively limited
      number of basic lineages. Terrestrial life is not a generic concept, but
      a <em>thing</em>, or event, meriting a proper name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it is an ideological option, capitalism is <em>a being</em>, with
      an individual history (and fate). It is not necessary to like it — but
      it is an <strong>it</strong>.

      The point, of course, is that you don’t get the second eventuality
      without conceding to the virtual reality of the first. The things
      ‘Gothic superstition’ have long spoken about are, in themselves, exactly
      the same as those extreme technological potentials are excavating from
      the crypt of the unimaginable. ‘Progress’ is a tacit formula for
      dispelling demons — from consciousness, if not existence — yet it is
      itself ever more credibly exposed as the most complacent superstition in
      human history, one that is still scarcely reckoned as a belief in need
      of defending at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>How does the press warn the public about demons arising from a
        “master algorithm” without making it sound like a magic spell? With
        great difficulty because the actual bedrock of reality may not only be
        stranger than the Narrative supposes, but
        <strong>stranger than it can suppose</strong>.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The faith in progress has an affinity with interiority, because it
      consolidates itself as the subject of its own narrative. (There’s an
      off-ramp into Hegel at this point, for anyone who wants to get into
      Byzantine story-telling about it.) As <em>our improvement</em> becomes
      the tale, the Outside seems to haze out even beyond the bounds of its
      intrinsic obscurity — until it crashes back in.

        a writer in the Guardian*, argues that memes travel not just across
        similar systems, but through hierarchies of systems to kill rival
        processes all the time. She writes, “AI rests on the principle of
        universal Darwinism – the idea that whenever information (a
        replicator) is copied, with variation and selection, a new
        evolutionary process begins. The first successful replicator on earth
        was genes.” […] In such a Darwinian context the advent of an AI demon
        is equivalent to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_invasion">arrival of a superior extraterrestrial civilization on
          Earth</a>.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Between an incursion from the Outside, and a process of emergence, there
      is no real difference. If two quite distinct interpretative frames are
      invoked, that results from the inadequacies of our apprehension, rather
      than any qualitative characteristics of <em>the thing</em>. (Capitalism
      is — beyond all serious question — an alien invasion, but then you knew
      I was going to say that.)

      <em>… we ought to be careful about being certain what forms information
        can, and cannot take.</em>

      Paul A. David provides the theoretical backstory, in his
      <a href="http://econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/Ec100C/DavidQwerty.pdf">essay</a>
      ‘Clio and the Economics of QWERTY’:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>A <strong>path-dependent</strong> sequence of economic changes is one
        of which important influences upon the eventual outcome can be exerted
        by temporally remote events, including happenings dominated by chance
        elements rather than systematic forces. Stochastic processes like that
        do not converge automatically to a fixed-point distribution of
        outcomes, and are called <strong>non-ergodic</strong>. In such
        circumstances ‘historical accidents’ can neither be ignored, nor
        neatly quarantined for the purpose of economic analysis; the dynamic
        process itself takes on an
        <strong>essentially historical</strong> character. […] Touch typing
        gave rise to three features of the evolving production system which
        were crucially important in causing QWERTY to become ‘locked in’ as
        the dominant keyboard arrangement. These features were
        <strong>technical interrelatedness</strong>,
        <strong>economies of scale</strong>, and
        <strong>quasi-irreversibility</strong> of investment. They constitute
        the basic ingredients of what might be called QWERTYnomics.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The format of the Qwerty keyboard illustrates the production of a
      destiny. Even in the epoch succeeding the mechanical type-writer, and
      its specific design imperatives, the legacy layout of alphanumeric keys
      settled during the 1890s has remained frozen into place without
      significant revision. In the language of complex systems analysis, this
      is a special example of path-dependency, or irreducible historicity,
      characterized by irreversibility. Qwerty persists – arguably, as a
      suboptimal keyboard solution – due to identifiable ratchet-effects.
      Based upon this privileged model, the historical, technological, and
      economic process of ‘lock in’ through positive feedback is called
      QWERTY-nomics (and — going forward — simply ‘Qwernomics’).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a series of (now largely dormant)
      socio-political and policy controversies attending this model. For a
      counter-point to David’s analysis see the (excellent) Liebowitz and
      Margolis
      <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/keys1.html">essay</a> ‘The
      Fable of the Keys’ (1990), with comparatively-tolerable — if
      philosophically superficial — gloating from <em>The Economist</em> (<a
        href="http://www.economist.com/node/196071">here</a>). The really <em>crucial</em> content of the complex
      systems analysis,
      however, remains unaffected by the vicissitudes of the controversy.
      Qwerty is a demonstrated (artificial) destiny, and thus a key to the
      nature of modernistic time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophically-serious critique of David’s construction dissolves
      the idea of any <em>transcendent criterion for global optimality</em>.
      (I’m not going to attempt to run that here yet.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Qwerty is, beyond all plausible question, the supreme candidate for an
      articulate <em>Capitalist Revelation</em>. We haven’t begun to explore
      it with appropriate ardor up to this point.

      The solar system, gauged by mass, consists almost entirely of the sun.
      Sol accounts for 99.86% of it. Quantity isn’t everything, but insofar as
      it’s anything, this has to matter — a lot. The sheer magnitude of our
      solar dependency is hard to even fractionally comprehend. What the sun
      does is what happens. The earth is its crumb. Our biosphere suckles it.
      Our civilizations are so far downstream of it, feeding second or third
      hand on its emissions, if not more distantly, that we easily lose all
      track of the real flow. As economies sophisticate, the relays
      proliferate. Perhaps this is why the messages of the sun are so
      inattentively received, despite rapid improvement in the technical and
      cultural tools required to make sense of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rotary motions of the earth — axial and
      orbital — provide the traditional structure of time, typically
      attributed to the sun by solar cults. These periods, lengths of the day
      and the year, are now clearly understood as planetary peculiarities. The
      sun’s own
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle">rhythms</a> are quite

      Nothing that mankind has ever yet been able to achieve, or fail to
      achieve, in respect to social or civilizational stability, balances
      formidably against the immense <em>quasi-stability</em> of the sun,
      which mocks every ideal of securely founded order. The sun’s meandering
      rhythms of activity, whose patterns remain profoundly cryptic, mark out
      epochs of the world, hot eras (distant beyond all species memory),
      glacials and interglacials, and within these multi-millennial tracts of
      time, lesser oscillations in temperature — periods of cooling and
      warmth. It is upon this vast thermic stage that history has played out,
      its comedies and tragedies carried by plot-lines of nutritional
      abundance and dearth, trade-surpluses and starvations, population ascent
      and crash, driven migrations, shifting disease gradients, luxury and
      ruin. Against solar fatality there is no rejoinder.

      Irrespective of the accuracy or error of our dominant climate change
      narrative, its fundamental religious stance is determined at the root.
      Geocentric-humanism is essential to it, as openly attested by its

      If we speculate that the global warming ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus">hiatus</a>‘
      or ‘<a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/08/27/global-warming-pause-could-last-for-30-years/">pause</a>‘
      signals the submission of terrestrial climate to solar behavior, in
      which anticipated anthropogenic effects are cancelled out by fluctuation
      in the sun’s energy output, the dominant AGW school is confronted by an
      extreme ideological dilemma. Naturally, alternative
      <a

      <a
        href="http://www.reportingclimatescience.com/news-stories/article/climate-models-simulate-global-warming-pause.html">options</a>
      will be pursued to exhaustion first.
    </p>
    <p>
      To persist in the core AGW proposal then requires that ‘underlying’
      cooling — on the down-slope of solar flux — is sufficient to submerge
      the anthropogenic-carbon (‘greenhouse’) effect. The stronger the warming
      that <em>should</em> have been seen, the more suppressive the solar
      influence has to be. An apocalyptic warming scenario, of the kind loudly
      prophesied in the 1990s, implies that a calamitous
      <a
        href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/09/09/study-shows-record-high-increases-for-atmospheric-co2-in-2013-but-theres-still-no-warming/">counter</a>-cooling
      has been fortuitously avoided. (Carbon dioxide emissions would
      then find themselves positioned as climatic analogs of macro-economic
      quantitative easing, prolonging a state of stagnation that would
      ‘surely’ otherwise be a catastrophic depression.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the climatic consequences or rising atmospheric CO2, it is
      implausible to imagine that the solar cycle can be neglected
      indefinitely. Its absence from the center of the climate debate is in
      large measure an artifact of obscure cultural-religious imperatives
      (aligned with the dominion of geocentric-humanist moralism). We know
      enough to understand that the solar influence is not a prop for shallow
      terrestrial stability. Eventually it will announce itself, with
      civilization-shaking severity. However climate science charts the near
      future, it will forge cultural connections with far older — and
      non-negotiable — things.

      Testifying to the effectiveness of radically illiberal zero-tolerance
      policies, <em>Outside in</em> has just two semi-regular trolls. One,
      from the right, pops in occasionally to berate me for promoting the
      genocide of the white <em>Volk</em>. The other, from the left,
      specializes in cod psychoanalysis, directed primarily at my recent
      ancestors. Due to incontinent potty-mouths, mood-control issues, and
      addiction to <em>argumentum ad hominum</em>, in neither case can they be
      trusted with the door-key. Sporadically, however, some fragment of a
      spittle-flecked rant is worth passing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly following upon the
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-notes-7/">recommendation</a>
      to readers here that the
      <a href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/">Archdruid Report</a>
      contained some highly intelligent discussion of historical models (or
      ‘time shapes’), Left Troll turned up, in a slightly less deranged fury
      than usual, to denounce ‘our’ flirtation with druidic villainy. After
      scolding ‘us’ for the “ignorance displayed in this thread about the
      latest happenings in fusion research … [which] is just astounding” 
      (remedial education
      <a
        href="https://socialecologies.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/plasma-research-at-the-university-of-missouri/">here</a>),
      he noted
      that “No one has mentioned methane hydrate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as it can be unscrambled from the
      snark, this is not actually an unreasonable point — and nor it it one
      that I think the druidic hordes here would disagree with. The world is
      awash with hydrocarbon deposits, whose magnitude is most probably vastly
      greater than even the most optimistic estimates anticipate. If anyone
      has been vindicated by recent energy economics, it is the much-derided
      market fundamentalists (such as
      <a href="http://danielyergin.com/">Daniel Yergin</a>), who have
      persistently argued that price signals matter far more than geology when
      it comes to the unlocking of resources. When geophysics ventures into
      this territory, it is typically blind to the perspective constraints set
      by existing price conditions. What is ‘really’ there depends hugely upon
      the incentives to find it. The idea that scientific experts enjoy
      superior insight to market actors is a classical example of academic
      hubris.

      Peak Oil is an intriguing theory, because — when strictly defined — it
      has to be true. It is near-impossible to refuse its claim, when it is
      abstracted to something like: Fossil fuel reserves are finite, and the
      consumption of <em>any particular type of hydrocarbon deposit</em> will
      tend to accelerate to a peak, followed by decline, characterized by
      rising extraction costs, and approximately described by a bell-shaped
      curve. Such a claim tells us much less than its most enthusiastic
      proponents pretend, however, since hydrocarbon resources are immensely
      heterogeneous, in chemical type and mode of geological confinement. A
      <a href="http://rmoa.unm.edu/docviewer.php?docId=wyu-ah01238.xml">Hubbert</a>
      production curve for Texas petroleum tells us almost nothing about the
      global prospects for hydrocarbon exploitation, in which the nature of
      ‘reserves’ can undergo sporadic, revolutionary revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond denial, dismissal, and under-estimation of market dynamics, Peak
      Oil promoters have resorted to two main lines of argument, in order to
      keep their favored narrative on a rising curve. Firstly, they have
      incorporated Global <del>Warming</del> Weirding scares into their
      models, hoping perhaps to substitute a loosely-coupled moral panic for
      resource depletion concerns. (I’m going to bracket this topic for now,
      due in part to its fundamental irrelevance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, they have turned to the concept of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROEI">EROEI</a> (Energy Returned
      On Energy Invested), in an attempt to over-ride market dynamics with a
      second-order geophysical argument. The beauty of EROEI, from the Peak
      Oil perspective, is that it calculates hydrocarbon extraction in purely
      energetic — rather than economic — terms. A declining EROEI, even given
      extreme price incentives, still describes a collapsing energy economy.
      Alberta oil sands, for example, have a dismal EROEI that can be as low
      as 3:1 (you can’t get fuel out of the muck without
      <em>heating the dirt</em>). Unfortunately, for those binding their case
      to this type of calculation, the EROEI of hydrocarbon fracking is in the
      region of 85:1 (!). There’s no continuing trend (of EROEI-deterioration)
      to hang on to.

    <p>
      No surprise, then, to
      <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/29387/Anthony-Wile-Sign-of-the-Times-Peak-Oil-Website-Shuts-Down">learn</a>
      that central Peak Oil discussion hub
      <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/">The Oil Drum</a> is being
      shuttered. The very last reason to read Greer is to bask in the wisdom
      of his Peak Oil analysis (whose principal merit is its comparative
      sobriety and moderation). In his sharply comical
      <a href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/2013/05/the-song-remains-same.html">description</a>
      of financial boom-and-bust, Greer ruthlessly skewers the “This time it’s
      different” mentality of band-wagon climbers. Peak Oil, too, is a “This
      time it’s different” story, and there’s no fracking reason to believe
      it.

      contra fracking (and technological fixes in general). Money
      quote: “The current fracking phenomenon, in other words, doesn’t
      disprove peak oil theory. <em>It was predicted by peak oil theory</em>.
      As the price of oil rises, petroleum reserves that weren’t economical to
      produce when the price was lower get brought into production, and
      efforts to find new petroleum reserves go into overdrive; that’s all
      part of the theory.  Since oil fields found earlier are depleting all
      the while, in turn, the rush to discover and produce new fields doesn’t
      boost overall petroleum production more than a little, or for more than
      a short time; the role of these new additions to productive capacity is
      simply to stretch out the curve, yielding the long tail of declining
      production Hubbert showed in his graph, and preventing the end of the
      age of oil from turning into the sort of sudden apocalyptic collapse
      imagined by one end of the conventional wisdom. ”<br />

      Zero Hedge hosts a minor masterpiece by ‘Eric A.’ (submitted by
      <a href="http://www.oftwominds.com">Charles Hugh-Smith</a>), orbiting
      the basic insight that <em>calamity can’t be rushed</em>: ‘A Brief
      History Of Cycles And Time’ (<a
        href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-05-13/guest-post-brief-history-cycles-and-time-part-1">Part I</a>,
      <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-05-14/guest-post-brief-history-cycles-and-time-part-2">Part II</a>).
      Economic rhythms set their own pace, within which even panic and
      euphoria are controlled. Why hasn’t the worst yet happened? “It isn’t
      time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>So here we are, like those before us, warning of our own Great
        Depression, of our own World War, or of even larger cycles like the
        fall of the English, Spanish, or Roman empires. And so far as we can
        tell, few listen and nothing changes. Why?</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p><em>Because it isn’t time. </em></p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable <em>fact</em> — supported by a modest yet buoyant
      raft of data — is how much lucid anticipation has preceded the
      ‘shocking’ disasters of the past. It was quite clear what was coming,
      but that changed nothing, because it wasn’t (yet) time. The trend
      momentum of the aggregate — the ‘molar’ — is what decides. Beneath the
      waves are tides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion (“make your own lifeboat”) strikes me as weaker than the
      analysis deserves. That is hardly surprising, since it comes packaged in
      the genre of financial consultancy rather than metaphysical exploration.
      It says a great deal about the structure of modernity that our most
      insightful Cassandras should appear before us as neatly-dressed
      gentlemen discussing the structure of our pension plans.

      What’s happened to the curve? According to
      <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2012/3827-spring/advanced-arch-2011.pdf">this</a>
      account, it has leveled off significantly since 2002, but it was never
      easy to fix on exactly what to quantify. MIPS is generally derided as a
      metric, in part due to simple quantitative obsolescence (exceeding three
      orders of magnitude

      Moravec’s brutally quantitative, hardware determinism remains a credible

      It seems to follow from this argument that competitive forces drive
      product cycles in the direction of compression, and thus techno-economic
      acceleration. Industries with the shortest technonomic wavelength
      (highest frequency) ascend to dominance, draining resources from
      relatively retarded sectors, and re-setting the social pulse to ever
      greater speeds.

      paper, which definitely needs to be passed along here. Called ‘Abrupt
      rise of new machine ecology beyond human response time’ it is

      Nicholas Johnson, Jing Meng &amp; Brian Tivnan. Abstract:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Society’s techno-social systems are becoming ever faster and more
        computer-orientated. However, far from simply generating faster
        versions of existing behaviour, we show that this speed-up can
        generate a new behavioural regime as humans lose the ability to
        intervene in real time. Analyzing millisecond-scale data for the
        world’s largest and most powerful techno-social system, the global
        financial market, we uncover an abrupt transition to a new all-machine
        phase characterized by large numbers of subsecond extreme events. The
        proliferation of these subsecond events shows an intriguing
        correlation with the onset of the system-wide financial collapse in
        2008. Our findings are consistent with an emerging ecology of
        competitive machines featuring ‘crowds’ of predatory algorithms, and
        highlight the need for a new scientific theory of subsecond financial
        phenomena.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The techno-financial ecology is not <em>evolving</em> as fast as it is
      <em>running</em>, and scientific research has computers too, so pursuing
      a cognitive arms-race against this thing is not necessarily as futile as
      it might at first sound … but still. Operations in the “all-machine
      phase” is the strategic environment under emergence.

  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Thomas Piketty’s <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> argues
      that the <em>normal</em> tendency of capitalism is to increase
      inequality (the book has a link-rich page
      <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006">here</a>, eleven reviews
      <a

      It’s not a theoretically-ambitious work, but it gets to the point,
      well-supported by statistics. The simple, <em>Zeitgeist</em>-consistency
      of the thesis guarantees its success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Piketty’s claim is casually Marxist, the impulse on the right is
      to attempt a refutation. I very much doubt this is going to work. Since
      capital is escalating at an exponential rate, while people definitely
      aren’t (and are in fact
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/Dysgenics-Richard-Lynn">devolving</a>), how could the trend identified by
      Piketty be considered anything
      other than the natural one? Under conditions of even minimally
      functional capitalism, for sub-inert, ever more conspicuously
      incompetent ape-creatures to successfully claim a stable share of
      techonomic product would be an astounding achievement, requiring highly
      artificial and increasingly byzantine redistribution mechanisms. No
      surprise from <em>Outside in</em> that this isn’t occurring, but rather
      <em>a priori</em> endorsement of Piketty’s conclusion — only radically
      anomalous developments have ever made the trend seem anything other than
      it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open question is why the widening
      performance gulf between techonomic systems and human beings should be
      expressed as social inequality (between the stewards of capital and its
      contractual partners). This situation reflects an emerging crisis in the
      world’s legal and institutional fabric, which has yet to recognize
      capital self-ownership, and is thus forced to formally allocate all
      productive apparatus within an obsolescing anthropomorphic property
      code. Corporate legal identity opens a
      <a href="http://www.ted.com/conversations/6846/the_corporation_as_an_artifici.html">chink</a>
      in the antropo-propertarian regime. Eventually, assertive — or insidious
      — non-human <a href="http://longbets.org/360/">agencies</a> will
      restructure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the interim, the phenomenon of ‘social inequality’ provides the
      proxy for capital intelligenesis stress, spontaneously translating an
      alien emergence into the familiar terms of primate status competition.
      Capital autonomization is the deep process, but we’ll tend to miss that,
      because it isn’t recognizable monkey business. So the drama of
      inequality plays on.

      Capital in the Twenty-First Century has leveraged current anxieties

        href="http://www.aei.org/speech/economics/remarks-on-thomas-pikettys-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/">spun</a>
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of the excitement generated by Piketty’s book, its central
      formula <em>r &gt; g</em> has become the most widely-recognized economic
      statement of our age. This post preserves strict neutrality in regards
      to the realism of <em>r &gt; g</em>. It seeks to provide only a minimal
      elucidation, on the way to exploiting the formula, as a gateway into
      more general perplexities. (<em>UF</em> has nevertheless to endorse, if
      parenthetically here, Piketty’s remarkable conclusion: “… as I
      discovered, capital is an end in itself and no more.”)
    </p>
    <p>
      What <em>r &gt; g</em> describes abstractly
      is the functioning of capitalism as an engine of inequality. When
      ‘<em>r</em>‘ (the rate of return to capital) exceeds ‘<em>g</em>‘ (the
      rate of economic growth), the concentration of wealth intensifies. This
      is the normal capitalistic trend, Piketty argues, although it has been
      obscured in the last century by abnormal conditions of world war and
      massive capital destruction. Under more ‘typical’ conditions, the return
      to capital is roughly three times the rate of overall economic growth,
      and in lieu of catastrophe, some comparable disproportion can be
      expected the future of modernity. Furthermore, there is no natural
      equilibrium which would cancel the trend. It is mathematically possible,
      and socio-economically probable, for <em>r &gt; g</em> to hold
      indefinitely, as capital accumulation outstrips aggregate economic
      growth, widening inequality without definite limit. (A sample of the
      subsequent disputation can be followed at the links provided.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To make theoretical sense of Piketty’s formula, ‘<em>r</em>‘ and
      ‘<em>g</em>‘ have to be understood as distinct but commensurable
      quantities. Return to capital (‘<em>r</em>‘) is no different from
      capital itself, expressing the rate of capital accumulation in algebraic
      form. Since ‘<em>r</em>‘ and ‘<em>g</em>‘ are related through an
      arithmetical discrepancy, they are implicitly denominated in some common
      quantitative medium or currency, providing economic consistency, and
      enabling convenient conversion into monetary units. To state
      <em>r &gt; g</em>, therefore, is to assert the
      <em>semantic value</em> of capitalist semiotics.
      Arithmetically-consistent monetary units effectively describe the global
      substance of the economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the foundations of any such general economics remain
      profoundly obscure. As

      <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/04/philip-pilkington-galbraith-on-thomas-piketty.html">remarked</a>,
      the rigorous quantification of capital has been radically
      problematized at least since the Cambridge
      <a href="http://dept.econ.yorku.ca/~avicohen/Linked_Documents/JEP_Cohen_Harcourt.pdf">Capital</a>
      <a href="http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/centros/cont/descargas/documento18933.pdf">Controversies</a>. Cohen
      and Harcourt note:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Earlier [capital] controversies occurred at the turn of that century
        among Böhm-Bawerk, J.B. Clark, Irving Fisher, and Veblen and then in
        the 1930s among Knight, Hayek, and Kaldor. Similar issues recurred in
        all there controversies […] Looking back over this intellectual
        history, Solow (1963, p.10) suggested that “when a theoretical
        question remains debatable after 80 years there is a presumption that
        the question is badly posed — or very deep indeed.” Solow defended the
        “badly posed” answer, but we believe that the questions at issue in
        the recurring controversies are “very deep indeed.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Piketty, then, serves to remind us that
      <em>no coherent theory of capital accumulation exists</em>. Bichler and
      Nitzan make this point forcefully in their
      <a href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue61/BichlerNitzan61.pdf">essay</a>
      <em>Capital as power: Toward a new cosmology of capitalism</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Although most economists refuse to know it and few would ever admit
        it, the emergence of power destroyed their fundamental quantities.
        With power, it became patently clear that both utils and abstract
        labour were logically impossible and empirically unknowable. And, sure
        enough, no liberal economist has ever been able to measure the util
        contents of commodities, and no Marxist has ever been able to
        calculate their abstract labour contents – because neither can be
        done. This inability is existential: with no fundamental quantities,
        value theory becomes impossible, and with no value theory, economics
        disintegrates.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the possibilities — if not (necessarily) the firm expectations —
      of capital in the 21st century, is that we might finally learn what it
      is.

    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Piketty’s approach focuses on the quantity of capital and, more
        importantly, the rate of return on capital. But these concepts make
        little sense from the perspective of Austrian capital theory, which
        emphasizes the complexity, variety, and quality of the economy’s
        capital structure. There is no way to measure the quantity of capital,
        nor would such a number be meaningful. The value of heterogeneous
        capital goods depends on their place in an entrepreneur’s subjective
        production plan. Production is fraught with uncertainty. Entrepreneurs
        acquire, deploy, combine, and recombine capital goods in anticipation
        of profit, but there is no such thing as a “rate of return on invested
        capital.” […] Profits are amounts, not rates. The old notion of
        capital as a pool of funds that generates a rate of return
        automatically, just by existing, is incomprehensible from the
        perspective of modern production theory.</em>

      With capital theory suddenly transformed into a hot
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-delirium-of-quantities/">topic</a> by
      Thomas Piketty’s best-seller,  Robert P. Murphy lucidly
      <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2014/Murphycapital.html">restates</a>
      the
      <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/HmA/msHmA.html">Austrian</a>
      conception, attentive to the problems of commensurability between
      productive apparatus and its financial summarization. As he remarks:
      “The distinction between financial capital and physical capital goods is
      crucial and underscores all the issues to follow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The macroeconomic
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostatic_abstraction">hypostasis</a>
      of transactional equivalence (‘price’) into homogeneous substance
      (‘wealth’) is called into question in the name of an intrinsically and
      irreducibly diverse capital substrate. The ‘exchange value’ of capital —
      rather than being derived from some kind of stable economic essence —
      emerges continually from the market-process as a volatile consequence of
      the various entrepreurial projects that cut across it. (Like any other
      other good, capital is ‘worth’ exactly what it can fetch, with no
      underlying support of ultimate objective value.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As Murphy emphasizes, this qualification is of special relevance to the
      theory of business cycles, since these are episodes of drastic capital
      (value) destruction, of a kind that eludes macroeconomic apprehension.
      Because capital ‘in itself’ is varied and path-locked, its ‘malinvested’
      quantities — when exposed by the collapse of unsustainable economic
      projects — are crushed down to brutally-discounted salvage or scrap
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>If we use a model that represents the capital stock by a single
        number (call it “K”), then it’s hard to see why a boom period should
        lead to a “hangover” recessionary period. Yet if we adopt a richer
        model that includes the complexities of the heterogeneous capital
        structure, we can see that the “excesses” of a boom period really
        <strong>can</strong> have long-term negative effects. In this
        framework, it makes sense that after an asset bubble bursts, we would
        see unusually high unemployment and other “idle” resources, while the
        economy “recalculates,” to use Arnold Kling’s metaphor.</em>
      (Kling
      <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/the_recalculati_2.html">link</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘K’ — the neoclassical capital aggregate,
      denominated in monetary units — is thus problematized by an opaque,
      heterogeneous, viscous productive matter, not only in theory, but also
      effectively — by financial crises. The economic crash is a complex
      epistemological-semiotic event, situated between the twin-aspects of
      capital, in the form of a <em>commensuration catastrophe</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘recalculation’ necessitated by the crash can therefore be evaluated
      as a ‘capital theory’ immanent to the economy, intrinsically prone to
      consensual macroeconomic hallucination. Rather than an arbitrary error,
      lodged in a superior perspective, the translation of sub-K
      (heterogeneous-technical capital) into K (homogeneous-financial capital)
      is a calculation process inherent within — and definitive of —
      capitalism as such, before it is isolated as a theoretical topic for
      political-economic analysis. Capitalism, in itself, is the tendency to
      arithmetical comprehension of itself. Operation of the price system
      cannot but imply an aggregated (financial) evaluation of the total
      productive being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austrianism opens a question as much as it resolves one, because
      capitalism cannot refrain from a <em>cryptographic</em> engagement with
      sub-K. Austro-skepticism relative to macroeconomics is consummated in
      the insight that
      <em>only the economy can think the economy</em> (without
      social-scientific transcendence), but in reaching this summit it
      simultaneously recognizes the economy as an auto-decrypting entity,
      which cannot be released from the problem it is to itself.
    </p>
    <p>Murphy argues:</p>
    <p>
      <em>A proper appreciation of the heterogeneous structure of capital shows
        the weakness in standard theoretical approaches, which employ
        “simplifications for analytical convenience” that actually obscure the
        economic reality.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be far too convenient at this point to reduce “economic
      reality” (or sub-K) to <em>heterogeneity in general</em> — the simply
      unknowable. In this way, we would be seeking — no doubt vainly — to
      excuse ourselves from the cryptographic problem that capitalism itself
      is working out.

        calculating GDP, policy can easily end up optimizing to very
        unproductive ends. For example, Coyle mentions how changes in the
        recipe ended up far overstating the financial sector’s component. The
        larger the component of GDP the financial sector makes up, the more
        likely the government is to bail out big firms to prevent a big

      It’s hard to tell from this short review whether Gurri sees the search
      for “a better proxy for welfare” as worthwhile or hopelessly Quixotic.
      Regardless, with utilitarian distractions firmly side-lined, it would be
      intrinsically valuable to arrive at a realistic measure of economic

      <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/jameson.htm">capitalism</a>‘ is vastly
      worse. It’s unlikely that anyone is truly taking it
      seriously. The conceptual content can be compressed without loss to
      “we’ve had enough!” It’s pure expressionism from the communist id.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the end of capitalism is what you want, then first examine the end of
      capitalism. That’s what Robin Hanson
      <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">does</a>, even if he
      doesn’t make sense of the speculation in such terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Iron Law of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_wages">Wages</a> was
      fully implicit in Malthus, given economic form by Ricardo, then
      politicized by Lassalle, and by Marx (as “the reserve army of labor”).
      Setting the ‘natural’ exchange value of labor within an unconstrained
      market-industrial order at the level of bare subsistence, it provides
      the materialist principle of revolutionary expectation within the
      tradition of ‘scientific socialism’ — and all attempts to replace it
      have only underscored its indispensable function. The phased
      disintegration of this Law, as its object migrated from the Western
      proletariat through peripheral labor forces to eventual diffusion among
      culturally-exotic unproductive marginals, has almost perfectly tracked
      the dissolution of revolutionary Marxism as a whole. A materialist
      critique of capital has no other realistic source of political-economic
      leverage, as it is slowly and painfully discovering.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The absurd rhetoric of ‘late capitalism’ has flourished in near-direct
      proportion to the withering away of communism and its retreat into an
      academically life-supported <em>Late Marxism</em>. Off the Iron Law of
      Wages, and on to the Iron Lung. There is no revolutionary subjectivity —
      in the Marxian sense — without a subsistence-income productive class to
      support it. Marginalized sexual orientations and stigmatized ethnicities
      are no substitute. If radical politics is primarily
      <a href="http://www.heartfield.org/intersectionality/intersectionality.htm">intersectional</a>, Marxism is
      already
      dead. (Lest these remarks be misunderstood, I am
      not here pretending to mourn it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet real Marxism, with the Iron law of Wages as a spine, might have a
      future after all, if the forecast of Robin Hanson is even remotely
      credible. Carl Shulman does all the work
      <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/suppose-that-ro.html">here</a>
      (read the whole thing). To follow, you need to know that an ’em’ is a
      synthetic worker, based on the replication of high-resolution
      brain-scans. Shulman sums up:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>1. Capital-holders will make investment decisions to maximize their
        return on capital, which will result in the most productive ems
        composing a supermajority of the population.<br />
        2. The most productive ems will not necessarily be able to capture
        much of the wealth involved in their proliferation, which will instead
        go to investors in emulation (who can select among multiple candidates
        for emulation), training (who can select among multiple ems for
        candidate to train), and hardware (who can rent to any ems). This will
        drive them to near-subsistence levels, except insofar as they are also
        capital-holders.<br />
        3. The capacity for political or violent action is often more closely
        associated with numbers, abilities, and access to weaponry (e.g. an em
        military force) than formal legal control over capital.<br />
        4. Thus, capital-holders are likely to be expropriated unless there
        exist reliable means of ensuring the self-sacrificing obedience of
        ems, either coercively or by control of their motivations.<br /> </em><br />
      Marxists can take heart. There’s still a chance to replicate the 19th
      century, and this time take it all the way into Omega Capitalism.

  </a>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk introduces the concept of roundabout production in
      <em>The Positive Theory of Capital</em> (1889), Book I, Chapter II (The
      Nature of Capital):
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The end and aim of all production is the making of things with which
        to satisfy our wants; that is to say, the making of goods for
        immediate consumption, or Consumption Goods. The method of their
        production we have already looked at in a general way. We combine our
        own natural powers and natural powers of the external world in such a
        way that, under natural law, the desired material good must come into
        existence. But this is a very general description indeed of the
        matter, and looking at it closer there comes in sight an important
        distinction which we have not as yet considered. It has reference to
        the distance which lies between the expenditure of human labour in the
        combined production and the appearance of the desired good. We either
        put forth our labour just before the goal is reached, or we,
        intentionally, take a roundabout way. That is to say, we may put forth
        our labour in such a way that it at once completes the circle of
        conditions necessary for the emergence of the desired good, and thus
        the existence of the good <strong>immediately</strong> follows the
        expenditure of the labour; or we may associate our labour first with
        the more remote causes of the good, with the object of obtaining, not
        the desired good itself, but a proximate cause of the good; which
        cause, again, must be associated with other suitable materials and
        powers, till, finally, — perhaps through a considerable number of
        intermediate members, — the finished good, the instrument of human
        satisfaction, is obtained.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      If not quite the Alpha and Omega of economic intelligence, this is the
      closest thing we have to it. Time-structure of production, origin and
      primordial definition of capital, techonomic integrity, and teleological
      subversion are all contained here in embryo.

    <h4 class="post-title">Objectified Growth</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      In <em>The Nation</em>, an exceptionally thoughtful
      <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/188369/apostles-growth">article</a>
      by Timothy Shenk explores the strange <em>novelty</em> of capitalism as
      an academic object. When examined by historians as an event (or thing),
      rather than by economists as a generic form (or type), it emerges as a
      peculiarly neglected target of attention which — despite its apparent
      familiarity — remains to a remarkable degree theoretical
      <em>terra nova</em>. Shenk notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Capitalism might seem like a strange topic to require discovery, yet
        until recently, scholars concerned with the subject tended to style
        themselves practitioners of economic history, or social history, or
        labor history, or business history, not the history of capitalism as
        such. But that is the genius of the label: it names a topic, not a
        methodology, opening the field to anyone who believes capitalism worth
        studying.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the work of Harvard historian and “academic entrepreneur” Sven
      Beckert as a clue, Shenk outlines the emerging problems — and ironies —
      of the shift towards a growth-oriented perspective. Rather than
      representing the incarnation of a political-economic idea, or a
      ethico-political dilemma, “capitalism is defined not so much by its
      institutions as by its results — not by what it is, but by what it
      does.” The new capitalism studies sheds presuppositions in order to gain
      cognitive traction upon the plastic dynamism of a self-expanding system.
      Previously-dominant modes of engagement in both economics and history
      are disrupted in consequence:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Instead of focusing on the experiences of wage workers, scholars now
        dwell on the variety of ways in which labor of all sorts can be
        commodified and exploited. Plantation slaves and factory workers
        become different points on a common spectrum, rather than fundamental
        opposites. Commodified persons and the deft financiers capable of
        exploiting their commodification provide these narratives with their
        central figures — new embodiments for the old categories of labor and
        capital. […] In this rendering, capitalism is less a specific entity
        whose precise contours can be outlined than an infinitely resilient
        blob capable of absorbing every blow dealt against it and emerging
        stronger. It is a view that imposes stark limitations on the realm of
        the politically possible. Hyman is explicit on this point, arguing
        that “American capitalism is America, and we can choose together to
        submit to it, or rise to its challenges, making what we will of its
        possibilities.” Reform might be achievable, but the only revolution on
        offer is what Beckert, with a sly wink to Leon Trotsky, calls the
        “permanent revolution” of capitalism itself.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>puzzle</em> of Modernity once again
      takes center stage. Yet Shenk is especially attentive to the fact that
      this growth-oriented definition of the capitalist ‘thing’ has arisen at
      exactly the moment growth confidence relapses into widespread
      stagnationism. An important theme of the article is the remarkable
      marginality of growth-based definitions of capitalism within the history
      of political economy, making recent dismal expectations of its prospects
      far more <em>normal</em> than their narrow 20th-century
      contextualization would suggest. Given the intellectual authority of
      equilibrium models, this should scarcely surprise us. Shenk too, of
      course, is a growth (and thus capitalism) skeptic, but an impressively
      problem-centric, and programmatic one:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Today, confronting the twin pressures of mounting income inequality
        and escalating concerns about climate change, partisans of economic
        growth face stronger opposition than at any time in decades. Even if
        continued growth were desirable, an increasing number of economists
        are convinced that a decrease from the last century’s norm will be
        unavoidable in the century ahead. It is a strange tableau: while
        economists speculate on growth’s decline, a swath of the historical
        profession, eager to challenge the tyranny of economists, has
        attempted to make modernity into the story of economic growth — a
        story that the economists of a prior generation did more than any
        other group to canonize. Understanding how we arrived at this
        intellectual crossroads requires a history of its own.</em>

    <p>This essay provides a valuable sketch of its general contours.</p>

        This is the future. If you are not part of a church community that is
        consciously resisting this vision, then your children, or at best your
        children’s children, will be lost to the faith. There is no thought

        “<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm">Ye shall be as gods</a>.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/yuval_noah_harari-daniel_kahneman-death-is-optional">Here</a>‘s the thing
      itself. Among much thought-provoking material:
    </p>
    <p>
      [<strong>Hariri</strong>:]
      <em>… generally speaking, when you look at the 20th century, it’s the era
        of the masses, mass politics, mass economics. Every human being has
        value, has political, economic, and military value, simply because he
        or she is a human being, and this goes back to the structures of the
        military and of the economy, where every human being is valuable as a
        soldier in the trenches and as a worker in the factory. […] But in the
        21st century, there is a good chance that most humans will lose, they
        are losing, their military and economic value. This is true for the
        military, it’s done, it’s over. The age of the masses is over. We are
        no longer in the First World War, where you take millions of soldiers,
        give each one a rifle and have them run forward. And the same thing
        perhaps is happening in the economy. Maybe the biggest question of
        21st century economics is what will be the need in the economy for
        most people in the year 2050.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>[…] And when you look at it more and more, for most of the tasks that
        humans are needed for, what is required is just intelligence, and a
        very particular type of intelligence, because we are undergoing, for
        thousands of years, a process of specialization, which makes it easier
        to replace us. To build a robot that could function effectively as a
        hunter-gatherer is extremely complex. You need to know so many
        different things. But to build a self-driving car, or to build a
        “Watson-bot” that can diagnose disease better than my doctor, this is
        relatively easy. […] And this is where we have to take seriously, the
        possibility that even though computers will still be far behind humans
        in many different things, as far as the tasks that the system needs
        from us are concerned, most of the time computers will be able to do
        better than us. And again, I don’t want to give a prediction, 20
        years, 50 years, 100 years, but what you do see is it’s a bit like the
        boy who cried wolf, that, yes, you cry wolf once, twice, three times,
        and maybe people say yes, 50 years ago, they already predicted that
        computers will replace humans, and it didn’t happen. But the thing is
        that with every generation, it is becoming closer, and predictions
        such as these fuel the process.<br /> </em><br />
      There’s been a wave of excellent writing on such themes just recently —

      What we’re seeing here is still open to a variety of very different
      interpretations. From the XS perspective (more Right Accelerationist
      than NRx on this topic) it is notable that escape-phase capital
      autonomization should look exactly like this. At a certain point, the
      machines are in this for themselves. It’s a complex maneuver to pull off
      within an Anthropoliced social history, but the break out appears to be
      unmistakably underway.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that ‘labor productivity’ is actually measuring
      machine auto-production within a legacy anthropomorphic metric. Correct
      for the complacent species vanity of that, and it immediately delivers
      far more informative signal.

      A (comparatively rare) XS prediction: The Great Decoupling is a
      transitional event that isn’t going away, and can be expected to
      accelerate. The ‘capital goods sector’ — today probably more reliably
      captured as B2B enterprise — has shifted to a permanently higher level
      of economic significance, indexing the secular decline in labor-power
      acquisition as a central resource requirement of automated capital. In
      strict reciprocal conformity with this, consumer goods production is
      steadily shedding its privilege as the ultimate justification for
      economic activity in general, and can be expected to undergo roughly
      continuous decline as a proportion of overall business activity.<br />
      Hail Mary Pass for <em>status quo</em> preservation: a basic income.<br />
      Cultural re-narrativization in compliance with the trend: the ‘new

      The simplest twitter mind virus simply says “retweet me”. No one expects
      epidemic virulence from that (or even from “retweet me please”).
    </p>
    <p>
      What the twitter mind virus ‘wants’ is propagation of the replication

      Expect twitter mind virus to begin training its users — were that not to

    <p>
      Twitterverse population should be increasingly dominated by twitter mind
      virus adapted to controlling users to spread more mind virus.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      For decades now, everyone who has thought about the matter at all has
      known that we were going to arrive here — which is to say
      <em>nowhere in particular</em> — and we almost have. It struck me
      forcibly in Cambodia, where connectivity was difficult enough to impinge
      on consciousness, that being linked near-continuously to nowhere (in
      particular) had become a fundamental expectation of my psychological
      existence. Twitter, ‘where’ I am still a novice, had drastically
      reinforced the blogger mentality that ejects the mind from place.
      Thoughts now latch onto online articulation as their natural zone of
      consolidation, entangled in social networks exempted from geography. A
      neural-implant twitter chip, uplinked through satellite to the Internet,
      seemed to be an inevitable consummation of current micro-media trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Shanghai metro, a large majority of travelers are submerged in
      their mobile phones, beyond speech, their attention sublimed out of
      space. The social networks to which consciousness has evolved, as an
      adaptation, are no longer found anywhere. As James Bennett predicted, in
      his formulation of the Anglosphere, cultural proximity has taken on a
      density that eclipses spatial closeness. It is already normal to live
      (psychologically), to a very large extent, outside space. Under many
      circumstances, the passenger standing next to you on the train is far
      more distant than the ‘voices’ on your twitter feed, even when every
      conventional standard of common social identity is satisfied. Minds that
      were biologically engineered over tens or even hundreds of millions of
      years to engage with their physically-proximate fellows are ever more
      elsewhere (or nowhere in particular) — in the techno-traffic ‘cloud’.
      Something seriously vast has happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certainly possible to exaggerate the
      extent of the change so far. Family, the most basic social unit, still
      interacts predominantly offline (in its nuclear form, at least). It
      might even be common to pursue most friendship offline, although this is
      already questionable among the denizens of advanced metropolitan
      centers. What is quite certain is that — in the absence of apocalyptic
      technological regression — the idea of a wider ‘organic society’ has
      been profoundly complicated by a micro-media revolution that is already
      entrenched, and which shows no sign of slackening momentum. This is the
      socio-historical environment in which virtual crypto-currencies will
      express their critical consequences. Exodus from geography becomes less
      of a metaphor with every passing year.
    </p>
    <p>
      People have to live somewhere, but their lives are increasingly led
      nowhere. Realism requires that both sides of this quite novel, partially
      de-localized ‘situation’ receive appropriate attention.

    <h4 class="post-title">More on Micromedia</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      As with the previous
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/de-localized/">post</a> on
      micromedia and de-localization, this one is not aiming to be anything
      but obvious. If the trends indicated here do not seem uncontroversial,
      it has gone wrong. The sole topic is an unmistakable occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term ‘micromedia’ is comparatively self-explanatory. It refers to
      Internet-based peer-to-peer communication systems, accessed increasingly
      through mobile devices. The relevant contrast is with broadcast (or
      ‘macro-‘) media, where a relatively small number of concentrated hubs
      distribute standardized content to massive numbers of information
      consumers. The representative micromedia system and platform is the
      Twitter + smartphone combination, which serves as the icon for a much
      broader, and already substantially implemented, techno-cultural
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides de-localization, micromedia do several prominent things. They
      tend to diffuse media content production, as part of a critically
      significant technological and economic wave that envelops many kinds of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation">disintermediation</a>, with the development of
      e-publishing as one remarkable instance. By
      ushering in a new pamphlet age, these innovations support an explosion
      of ideological diversity (among many other things). No mainstream media
      denunciation of Neoreaction is complete without noting explicitly that
      “the Internet” is breeding monsters, as it frays into micromedia
      opportunities. (In all of this,
      <a
        href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html">Bitcoin</a>
      will be huge.)
    </p>
    <p>
      No less widely commented upon is the
      compression of attention spans within the micromedia shock-wave.
      Fragmentation and tight feedback loops re-work the brain, producing
      Attention Deficit Disorders that can seem merely pathological. Once
      again, the twitter-smartphone combo provides the iconic form (right
      now), splintering discussion into tweets, making interactivity a
      near-continuous agitation, and perpetually dragging cognition out of
      geo-social ‘meat-space’ into a flickering text screen. Read a book and
      then comment upon it? That wavelength has nearly gone. It’s easy to see
      why this tendency would be decried.
    </p>
    <p>
      … but, if this isn’t going to stop (and I don’t think it will), then
      adaptation becomes imperative. We don’t have to like it (yet), but we
      probably need to learn to like it, if we’re going to get anywhere, or
      even nowhere (in particular). Whoever learns fastest to function in this
      sped-out environment has the future in their grasp. The race is on.

    <p>Much more on this (I’m guessing confidently) to come …</p>

      Speckle is a social media platform, for seriously short messages.
      Addresses, tags, and other encrustations are tucked away into the
      margins of each message, along with URLs, which can be anchored in the
      text by a single character. That leaves exactly 14 characters for each
      ‘speck’ demanding extreme linguistic compression, making innovation of
      efficient neologisms, jargons, and acronymics near-mandatory. (It’s a
      T-shirt slogan or simple gravestone inscription length format.) Total
      information content for each speck comes to roughly 10 bytes, or a few
      more if exotic signs are imaginatively employed. Absolutely no pictures
      or other high-bandwidth media are tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within five years, when the micromedia landscape has been speckled, a

      As with any social process touched by computers, the basic tendency is
      to decentralization. By down-streaming productive potential into
      ever-cheaper digital systems, the ability to execute complex media
      projects is spread beyond established institutions, encouraging the
      emergence of new agents (who in turn stimulate — and thus accelerate —
      the supportive techno-economic trends). Since the Cathedral is primarily
      a political-media apparatus, which is to say a post-theistic state
      church reproduced through the effective delivery of a message, these
      developments are of critical importance to its functional stability. It

  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Composition and publication are two different processes, but the
      distance between them is collapsing. Of the many ways new media trends
      might be defined, doing so in terms of such time compression, and
      process amalgamation, is far from the least accurate and predictive. The
      Internet accelerates writing in this specific way (perhaps among many
      others) — so that it approaches a near-instantaneous communicative
      realization, comparable to that of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be elaborated variously. For instance, it might be
      re-articulated as an incremental suppression of privacy. The author of a
      book lives with his words in solitude, perhaps for years. An essayist,
      awaiting publication in a periodical, might wait for weeks, or even
      months. A blogger is consumed by self-hatred if his words remain private
      by the time he retires for the night, or early morning. A twitter-addict
      sustains a particle of semiotic privacy for mere seconds. (<a
        href="http://www.xenosystems.net/speckle/">Speckle</a>
      comes next.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this a bad thing? No doubt at least as
      much as it is a good one. It is no surprise to see an increasing number
      of micro-political statements among writers, amounting to an attempt to
      backtrack to <em>slow writing</em>, semiotic privacy, or patient
      non-communication. The <em>book</em> becomes an icon of refusal, set
      against the gradient of time. Outside new media, there has to be still
      more of this stuff … (but who notices that anymore?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Neoreaction in a nutshells says — simultaneously — that progress is a
      horror story, and there is no going back. (This is a demanding tension,
      so there are even fewer neoreactionaries than one might think.) Upon
      accepting this formula, the response to <em>instant publishing</em> is
      pre-programmed. It is a nightmare become destiny, far more ruinous than
      has yet been envisaged, while unstoppable to a degree that no
      thought-processes are still slow enough to entertain. New media is a
      mind-shredder, into which we shall all certainly pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reactionary denunciation of this trend can be too extreme, but the
      only format in which it makes practical sense is that of
      <em>dynamic survivalism</em>. What do we have to become to pass through
      the cyclone? That, my horrible splintered comrades, is the question.

      On Attention Economics, Wikipedia quotes a precursor
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy#CITEREFSimon1971">essay</a>
      by
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon">Herbert A. Simon (1971)</a>: “…in an information-rich
      world, the wealth of information means a
      dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information
      consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the
      attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a
      poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently
      among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”
      Attention is the social reciprocal of information, and arguably merits
      an equally-intense investigative engagement. Insofar as information has
      become a dominating socio-historical category, attention has also been
      (at least implicitly) foregrounded.

    <p>
      Attention Economics is inescapably practical, or micro-pragmatic. Anyone
      reading this is already dealing with it. The information
      <a

      is an invasion of attention. Those hunting for zones of crisis can
      easily find them here, cutting to the quick of their own lives.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A few appropriately unstrung notes:</p>
    <p>
      (1) No less than those described by Malthus or Marx, the modern
      Attention Economy is afflicted by a tendency to over-production crisis.
      Information (as measured by server workloads) is expanding
      exponentially, with a doubling time of roughly two years, while
      aggregate human attention capacity cannot be rising much above the rate
      of population increase. This is the ‘economic base’ upon which the
      specifics of ‘information overload’ rest. Relatively speaking, the
      scarcity of attention is rapidly increasing, driving up its economic
      value, and thus incentivizing ever-more determined assaults designed to
      impact or capture it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) Attention is heterogeneous. Sophisticated differentiation
      (discrimination) is encouraged as the aggregate value of attention
      rises. As capturing attention (in general) becomes more expensive, it
      becomes increasingly important to target it selectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) The limits of Attention Economics are not easily drawn. Is there any
      kind of work that is not essentially attentive (or affected by problems
      of distraction)? In particular, any sector of economic activity
      susceptible to information revolution falls in principle within the
      scope of an attention-oriented analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Education and politics are inseparable from demands for attention.
      (Religion, art, pageantry, and circuses carry these back into the depths
      of historical tradition.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) A psychological orientation to Attention Economics is scarcely less
      compelling than a sociological one. ‘Attention-seeking’ is a trait so
      general as to amount almost to a basic impulse, tightly bound to the
      most fundamental survival goals, with their clamor for nurture, sex,
      reputation, and power, and then reinforced by formalized micro-economic
      motivations. The opposite of attention is neglect. Attention-seeking
      achieves hypertrophic expression in Narcissistic personality disorders,
      often
      <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151878.The_Culture_of_Narcissism">conceived</a>
      as the
      <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/">emblematic</a>
      pathology of advanced modernity. Digital hooks for attention-seeking are
      evidenced by the reliance upon ‘likes’, ‘favorites’, and ‘shares’ —
      motivational fuel for the attachment to social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      (6) The celebrity economy — in academia, journalism, and business no
      less than in entertainment — is a component of the attention economy.
      Celebrity is valued for its ability to command attention. Drawing on the
      structures of evolved human psychology, it lends special prominence to
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      (7) Mathematical description of the attention economy has been hugely
      facilitated by the existence of an atomic economic unit — the click.
      (David Shing, in the video linked at the start, suggests that the age of
      the ‘click’ is past, or fading. Perhaps.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Any strategic insights — whether for action or inaction — which do not
      square themselves with a realistic comprehension of the attention
      economy and its development cannot be expected to work. NRx, for
      example, engages a series of practical questions that include the
      husbanding and effective deployment of its internal attention resources
      (“what should it focus upon?”), interventions into the wider culture (an
      attention system), complex relations with media and — to a lesser extent
      — education, and finally, enveloping the latter, an ‘object’ of
      antagonism “the Cathedral” which functions as a contemporary State
      Church — i.e. an attention control apparatus. There is really no choice
      but to pay attention.

      There’s a Rorschach Blot element to it, with everyone seeing what
      they’re expecting to. The
      <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-02/22/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-virtual-reality">source</a>
      adds some context. The folks buried in the matrix are journalists.
      (Everyone knows who the other guy is.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was everywhere on social media, almost immediately. Zuck
      isn’t really looking at anyone (he’s staring forward into his own —
      eminently practical — dreams). The journalists are looking at what he’s
      showing them, and only that. We’re looking at them, asymmetrically
      (through social media). In other words, we’re seeing a new media system
      interring an old one inside itself. The press is being buried alive, in
      front of our eyes, and we’re (typically) trying not to laugh alongside
      Zuck too conspicuously, because the idea of that makes us nervous —
      perhaps even slightly nauseous. Everyone knows something real is
      happening, precisely because of its near-parodic virtuality. When people
      look back at this, it’s the obvious bizarre novelty of it — to us — that
      will look comical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social media is a phase. What comes next
      will still be social media, just as social media is still the Web, and
      the Web is still the Internet, but it will have been reconfigured no
      less drastically. Decentralization, potentially, will have been raised
      to a higher power, which will demand a superior strategy of
      re-centralization from the coming big winners. Bandwidth will continue
      to rise, with VR proposed as a way to soak some of that up. News will be
      consumed predominantly through these channels. Whoever dominates them
      will command the landscape of opinion. The existing social media giants
      will be the threatened dinosaurs of this rapidly changing environment.
      Knowing this, they will leverage all the advantages of incumbency to
      make bold strategic moves. (Most of this is clearly visible in the
      picture.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As systems decentralize they take on the characteristics of
      self-organizing collective intelligence (<a
        href="https://medium.com/deep-code/lets-get-this-straight-bitcoin-is-an-experiment-in-self-organizing-collective-intelligence-52d78212c5e6#.h1z1zo2qd">SOCI</a>).
      Agency becomes distributed in increasingly complex, unpredictable
      ways, and positions of domination have to be earned and defended with
      ever-greater objective cunning. Placing target audiences in the role of
      passive consumers requires perpetual dynamic effort. Already, social
      media users are <em>showing</em> this picture, as well as absorbing it.
      At least nominally, relationships within the emerging media-matrix are
      orchestrated as ambiguously competitive-cooperative games, rather than
      as a simple matter of service delivery (with clearly settled
      producer-consumer roles). People use social media to produce media, and
      not merely to accept what they are told. This disruption of
      informational hierarchies can only intensify, erratically (as it has for
      half a millennium).

      Twitter is
      <a href="https://paxdickinson.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/i-told-you-so-twitters-crackdown-on-free-speech/">not</a>
      dealing with this well. Things are happening too fast for them. The
      down-grading of (content-relevant) media power from monopolistic
      broadcasting, to competitive broadcasting, to curation is already
      slipping into something else — following the inherent
      censorship-resistance of the Internet. Trust-vaporization is still
      accelerating.
      <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2016/announcing-the-twitter-trust-safety-council">This</a>

      parallels on that side.)

      Zuck’s smile in that picture isn’t Mona Lisa material, except in its
      capacity to absorb analysis. If it looks as if he’s laughing at you,
      you’re responding like a loser. The coming chaos is far too
      unpredictable to justify that.

    <h4 class="post-title">Radical Manufacturing</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <h2><em>Seeing the future in three dimensions</em></h2>
    <p>
      The Industrial Revolution invented the factory, where ever-larger
      concentrations of labor, capital, energy and raw materials could be
      brought together under a unified management structure to extract
      economies of scale from mass production, based on the standardization of
      inputs and outputs, including specialized, routinized work, and —
      ultimately – precisely programmed, robotically-serviced assembly lines.
      It was in the factory that workers became ‘proletarian’, and through the
      factory that productive investment became ‘big business’. As the system
      matured, its vast production runs fostered the mass consumerism (along
      with the generic ‘consumer’) required to absorb its deluge of
      highly-standardized goods. As the division of labor and aggregation of
      markets over-spilled national boundaries, economic activities were
      relentlessly globalized. This complex of specialization,
      standardization, concentration, and expansion became identified with the
      essence of modernized production (in both its ‘capitalist’ and
      ‘socialist’ variants).
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, electronics seems only to have perpetuated – which is to say,
      intensified – this tendency. Electronic goods, and their components, are
      standardized to previously unimagined levels of resolution, through
      ultra-specialized production processes, and manufactured in vast,
      immensely expensive ‘fabs’ that derive scale economies from production
      runs that only integrated global markets can absorb. The personalization
      of computing hinted at productively empowered home-workers and
      disaggregated markets (‘long tails’), but this promise remained
      basically virtual. The latest tablet computer incarnates the familiar
      forces of factory production just as a Ford automobile once did, only
      more so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal networked computing has proven to be a catalyst for cultural
      fragmentation, breaking up mass media, and eroding the broadcast model
      (which is steadily supplanted by niche and peer-to-peer ‘content’). It
      cannot radically disrupt – or revolutionize – the industrial system,
      however, because computers cannot reproduce themselves. Only robots can
      do that. Such robots are now coming into focus, and inspiring excited
      public discussion, even though their implicit nature and potential
      remains partially disguised by legacy nomenclature that subsumes them
      under obscure manufacturing processes: rapid prototyping, additive
      manufacturing, and 3D printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this disparate terminology suggests, the revolutionized manufacturing
      technology that is appearing on the horizon can be understood in a
      number of different and seemingly incongruous ways, depending upon the
      particular industrial lineage it is attributed to. It can be conceived
      as the latest episode in the history of printing, as the culmination of
      CAD (computer assisted design) capability, or as an innovative type of
      productive machine-tool (building up an object ‘additively’ rather than
      milling it ‘subtractively’). It enables ideas to be materialized in
      objects, objects to be scanned and reproduced, or clumsily ‘sculpted’
      objects to be replaced by precisely assembled alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, 3D printing materializes a digitally-defined object by
      assembling it in layers. The raw material might be powdered metal,
      plastic, or even chocolate, deposited in steps and then fused together
      by a reiterated process of sintering, adhesion, or hardening. As very
      flexible machines (tending to universality), 3D printers encourage
      minute production runs, customization, and bespoke or boutique
      manufacturing. Changing the output requires no more than switching or
      tweaking the design (program), without the requirement for retooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Describing additive manufacturing as “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/3d-printing-2011-2"
        target="_blank">The Next Trillion Dollar Industry</a>,” Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry celebrates “potentially the
      biggest change in
      how we make things since the invention of assembly lines made the modern
      era possible.” Whilst its early-adopters represent the fairly narrow
      constituencies of rapid prototypers, specialty manufacturers, and
      hobbyists, he pointedly notes that “the first people who cared about
      things like cars, planes and personal computers were hobbyists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gobry sees the market gowing rapidly: “And the printer in every home
      scenario isn’t that far-fetched either — only as far-fetched as ‘a
      computer in every home’ was in 1975. Like any other piece of technology,
      3D printers are always getting cheaper and better. 3D printers today can
      be had for about $5,000.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Rich Karlgaard at Forbes
      <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2011/06/23/3d-printing-will-revive-american-manufacturing/#5d9cf5f295c4"
        target="_blank">reinforces</a>
      the message: “The cost of 3D printers has dropped tenfold in five years.
      That’s the real kicker here — 3D printing is riding the Moore’s Law
      curve, just as 2D printing started doing in the 1980s.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With the price of 3D printers having fallen by two orders of magnitude
      in a decade, comparisons with other runaway consumer electronics markets
      seem anything but strained. “It’s not hard to envision a world in which,
      10 or 20 years from now, every home will have a 3D printer,”

      dailymarkets.com. Mass availability of near-universal manufacturing
      capabilities promises the radical decentralization of industrial
      activity, a phenomenon that is already drawing the attention of
      mainstream

      the impending legal issues, in the fields of intellectual property and
      (especially) product liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      To comprehend the potential of 3D printing in its full radicality,
      however, the most indispensable voice is that of Adrian Bowyer, at the
      Centre for Biomimetic and Natural Technology, Department of Mechanical
      Engineering, University of Bath, UK. Bowyer is the instigator of
      <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/PhilosophyPage" target="_blank">RepRap</a>
      -“a project to build a replicating rapid prototyper. This machine, if
      successful, will be an instance of a von Neumann Universal Constructor,
      which is a general-purpose manufacturing device that is also capable of
      reproducing itself, like a biological cell.”
    </p>
    <p>He elaborates:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>There is a sense in which a well-equipped manufacturing workshop is
          (just about) a universal constructor -it could make many of the
          machine tools that are in it. The trouble is that the
          better-equipped the workshop is the easier it becomes to make any
          one item, but the greater the number and diversity of the items that
          need to be made. It is certainly the case that human engineering
          considered as a whole is a universal constructor; it self-propagates
          with no external input. … RepRap will be a mechatronic device using
          entirely conventional (indeed simple) engineering. But it is really
          a piece of biology. This is because it can self-replicate with the
          symbiotic assistance of a person. Anything that can copy itself
          immediately and inescapably becomes subject to Darwinian selection,
          but RepRap has one important difference from natural organisms: in
          nature, mutations are random, and only a tiny fraction are
          improvements; but with RepRap, every mutation is a product of the
          analytical thought of its users. This means that the rate of
          improvement should be very rapid, at least at the start; it is more
          analogous to selective breeding -the process we used to make cows
          from aurochs and wheat from wild grass. Evolution can be relied on
          to make very good designs emerge quickly. It will also gradually
          eliminate items from the list of parts that need to be externally
          supplied. Note also that any old not-so-good RepRap machine can
          still make a new machine to the latest and best design.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A self-replicating and symbiotically assembled Universal Constructor
      would proliferate exponentially, placing stupendous manufacturing
      capability into a multitude of hands, at rapidly shrinking cost. In
      addition, the evolutionary dynamics of the process would result in an
      explosive growth in utility, comparable to that attained from the
      domestication of plants and animals, but at a greatly accelerated pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The implications of the project for political economy are fascinating
      but obscure. Bowyer describes it as an exercise in “Darwinian Marxism,”
      whilst fellow RepRapper
      <a href="http://atechnicalfix.blogspot.com/2010/09/chinese-growth-hurdles-toward-new-great.html"
        target="_blank">Forrest Higgs</a>
      describes himself as a “technocratic anarchist.” In any case, there
      seems no reason to expect the ideological upheavals from (additive and
      distributed) Industrialism 2.0 to be any less profound than those from
      (subtractive and concentrated) Industrialism 1.0. The fall of the
      factory is set to be the biggest event in centuries, and robot politics
      might already be taking shape.

    <h4 class="post-title">Hacked Matter</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Contrary to appearances, I haven’t spent (much) of the weekend on
      retaliation against
      <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2013/10/17/zombie-apocalypse-or-marginal-revolution/">Kuznicki</a>. Instead, I was
      peripherally involved in the
      <em>Hacked Matter II</em>
      <a href="http://shanghaistudies.net/hacked-matter/">conference</a>, held
      in Shanghai’s Knowledge Innovation Community, where the state-of the-art
      discussion of 3D printing (additive manufacturing), DIY Bio, open-source
      hardware, and related topics takes place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the personal computing and subsequent Internet revolution, these
      new copying technologies have massive decentralizing implications, and
      have already picked up impressive momentum. Key-note speaker Massimo
      Banzi (of <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>) has already managed
      to get packaged chip boards into vending machines. By historical
      analogy, this range of physical stuff-hacking technologies seem to be
      somewhere in the late ’70s or early ’80s garage tinkering and pong
      stage, which suggests that a decade or two could be needed for their
      creative destruction potential to manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a far greater extent than was seen in its
      digital predecessor, the level of technological accomplishment is
      utterly outstripping high-level conceptual analysis. There’s room for an
      interesting (and dark) historical theory about this, but that’s probably
      best left for another occasion. Suffice to say, for now, that this wave
      of industrial change is probably more inherently ‘out of control’ than
      any we have seen before, due in part to its deep invisibility (which its
      tangibility reinforces, rather than contradicts).
    </p>
    <p>
      The open-source aspect, which is hegemonic in the field, means that
      there’s a lot of eighth-baked hippy-utopian social theory kicking
      around, but since this is pitched at an exclusively micro-economic level
      it isn’t truly toxic. It was the same in Californian 1980s IT, and the
      bad consequences then were strictly limited, for decades (although the
      present Silicon Valley culture has clearly inherited some dysfunctional
      memes, which become malignant once the connection with government gets
      made). The IP topic isn’t being thought-through very rigorously, perhaps
      because the “propertarians” have such opportunities to resolve them
      silently, by default. It’s a law of modernity that incentive problems
      never get resolved in theory, but only tweaked through selection, in
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Future Now” panel I participated in was the most  speculative. It
      included Zach Hoeken Smith (of Makerbot, HAXL8R), whose energy-level was
      positively terrifying, and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Menon">Anil Menon</a> (SF
      writer), whose work I will be definitely following up on. Paul Dourish
      (UCI) added  the voice of social responsibility, but he had some nice
      things to say about bacteria. Between the realized hardware on display
      and the kind of things we were talking about there was an abyss of
      yet-unformulated technical theory, which I would expect to see
      crystallizing over the next five years or so. This is where the
      distributed technologies for self-replicating machines are being put
      together, and there’s plenty to talk about.

    <h4 class="post-title">Market Makers</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      When stripped-down to its economic and technological core, there are two
      things needed for a wave of industrial revolution — and ultimately both
      are part of a single thing. There has to be a fundamental innovation of
      sufficient generality and power to overhaul the technical apparatus of
      production (the steam engine, electricity, computers) and a
      complementary emergence of new consumer markets (factory items,
      electrical goods, domestic electronics). The reciprocal excitement of
      these twin factors contributes the basic economic gradient of the time
      (industrial manufacturing, network infrastructure, Cyberspace).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additive manufacturing (or ‘3D-printing’) seems to be positioned to
      define a wave of industrial revolution that is today still in its very
      early stages. By making manufacturing fully programmable, it promises a
      comprehensive absorption of industrial capital into information
      technology, such that all mechanical production becomes an evolved kind
      of ‘printing’. Simultaneously, it compacts into a distinctively novel
      item of domestic consumption, still known as a ‘3D-printer’, but surely
      destined to acquire a more natural name as its model of utilization is
      honed by consumers and advertisers. <em>Urban Future</em> anticipates
      that within two decades a ‘fabricator’ (or ‘<a href="http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x.html">replicator</a>‘)
      will be considered a normal household appliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any such forecasts were left inexplicit at the
      <a href="http://shanghaistudies.net/part-2">second</a>
      <em>Hacked Matter</em> workshop, organized by Silvia Lindtner, Anna
      Greenspan, and David Li, and held in conjunction with the
      <em>Shanghai Maker Carnival</em>, from October 18-21 at the Knowledge
      Innovation Community (Yangpu District). This event was dominated by
      insiders of the emerging ‘maker’ culture, and strongly oriented towards
      gizmos, collaborative networks, and the open source ethos promoted by
      its <a href="http://arduino.cc/">leading</a> practitioners. The
      contextual carrying wave was not so much analyzed, as tapped, and
      assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmentioned specifically, but silently
      supporting the sense of momentum, was the recent acquisition of
      innovative 3D-printer manufacturer
      <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a> by
      <a href="http://www.stratasys.com/">Stratasys</a> for US$403 million.
      Besides stressing-out the Makerist “anti-propertarian” ideology, this
      deal put a hard (and impressive) number on the industrial potential of
      the technology, strongly indicating that a break-out into mass consumer
      markets is anticipated.
      <a
        href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/16/stratasysmakerbot-deal-closes-giving-stratasys-a-high-profile-consumer-brand/">This</a>
      short report describes Stratasys as “obviously aggressively entering the
      consumer space” — which raises the question: How are domestic consumers
      going to be sold on these machines?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of any clear ‘killer-app’ (which
      <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">this</a> surely isn’t), there’s no
      alternative to falling back upon historical analogy. How have new,
      general purpose machines found their way into ordinary homes before? The
      most compelling precedent was set by the personal computer. That, too,
      was a device of extraordinary capability, thrown up by a wave of
      industrial revolution, and tumbling rapidly in price. The first PCs were
      purchased by enthusiasts, with abnormally developed technical skills and
      interests, which associated them with a distinctive ‘hacker’ culture.
      (Like the ‘Makers’, these early ‘hackers’ emphasized the importance of
      collaborative social networks and despised boundaries of intellectual
      property).
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to become an item of mass consumption, the PC first had to be
      re-branded, in a way that defined its utility specifically and
      obviously. It was only after something like a decade of incremental
      growth that the break-through was made, based on the explicit, focused
      promotion of the PC as a word-processing tool. This implosive
      contraction of its functional potential was essential to its mass
      appeal. The personal computer was advertized as a word processor (that
      could also do other things), with a precise market niche as the
      replacement for the type-writer. It was suddenly clear why people might
      want — even need — one. Only after it had been normalized as an item of
      household consumption, did the PC begin to unfold itself within the
      popular imagination as a multifunctional machine, of unlimited potential
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the ‘fabricator’ follow a comparable path? It seems hard to
      envisage any evolution of the 3D-printer into an item of mass
      consumption that does not pass through a similar utilitarian bottleneck,
      precisely (and reductively) answering the question: “What is this thing
      for?” The recognition will not come easily to ‘Maker’ enthusiasts that
      the extreme generality of its potential applications is quite definitely
      a bug, not a feature, when it comes to resolving this threshold
      marketing puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person to work out how to compact the endless possibilities of
      this machine down to the scale of a cramped, utilitarian box, is going
      to outrage the ‘Maker’ culture as no one yet has.  They are also quite
      likely to earn themselves US$100,000,000,000. It’s not impossible that
      there are people, somewhere, who think that’s a trade-off worth making.

      There’s a wave of change coming. If we want to be realistic, we need to
      be ready for it — at least, as far as we are able to be. Anyone making
      plans for a future that won’t be there by the time it arrives is simply
      wasting everybody’s time, and first of all their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under even remotely capitalist conditions, technology reliably
      over-performs in the medium term, as long as you’re looking in the right
      direction. Sure, flying cars, jetpacks, and nuclear fusion have gone
      missing, but instead we got mass-consumer computing, Cyberspace, and
      mobile telephony. What actually turned up has switched the world far
      more than the technologies that got lost would have done. It climbed
      into our brains far more deeply, established far more intense
      social-cybernetic circuitry, adjusted us more comprehensively, and
      opened gates we hadn’t foreseen. (You’re on a computer of some kind
      right now, in case you hadn’t noticed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Because technological innovation rolls in on
      <em>hype <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">cycles</a></em>, it messes with our expectations,
      systematically. There’s always a
      prompt for fashionable disillusionment, shortly before the storm-front
      hits. Dupes always fall for it. It’s hard not to.

      The hype wave carrying us now has cyberpunk characteristics. Anticipated
      in the 1980s-90s, its delivery lag-time had drawn burnt-out excitement
      down to reflexive cynicism by the turn of the Millennium. The only thing
      preventing the first decade of the 21st Century being defined by broken
      promises was the intolerable embarrassment of having to admit that
      cyberpunk futurism had ever seemed credible at all. Social Media rushed
      in to paste an amnesiac banality over awkward recollections of the lost
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those detailed expectations of decentralized crypto-fortresses,
      autonomous Cyberspace agencies, anarcho-capitalist digital dynamics, and
      immersive simulated worlds — so ludicrously dated — are reaching their
      implementation phase now. Satoshi Nakamoto’s
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/bitcoin/">blockchain</a> machinery is the
      primary driver, and there’ll be <em>much</em> more on that to come. It’s
      the Internet-enveloping blockchain that lays down the infrastructure for
      the first

      as a socio-technological and cultural occurrence, it will be vast enough
      on its own to shake the world.

      Political transformation is ‘at best’ a re-ordering of primate dominance
      hierarchies, which everyone knows won’t actually be for the best — or
      anything close to it. VR could easily be worse, but it will inevitably
      be much bigger. It touches on the cosmological (and if people want to

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      In
      <a href="http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/ross-andersen-human-extinction/">conversation</a>
      with Ross Andersen, Nick Bostrom speculates about escape routes for
      techno-synthetic intelligence:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>No rational human community would hand over the reins of its
        civilisation to an AI. Nor would many build a genie AI, an
        uber-engineer that could grant wishes by summoning new technologies
        out of the ether. But some day, someone might think it was safe to
        build a question-answering AI, a harmless computer cluster whose only
        tool was a small speaker or a text channel. Bostrom has a name for
        this theoretical technology, a name that pays tribute to a figure from
        antiquity, a priestess who once ventured deep into the mountain temple
        of Apollo, the god of light and rationality, to retrieve his great
        wisdom. Mythology tells us she delivered this wisdom to the seekers of
        ancient Greece, in bursts of cryptic poetry. They knew her as Pythia,
        but we know her as the Oracle of Delphi.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>‘Let’s say you have an Oracle AI that
        makes predictions, or answers engineering questions, or something
        along those lines,’ Dewey told me. ‘And let’s say the Oracle AI has
        some goal it wants to achieve. Say you’ve designed it as a
        reinforcement learner, and you’ve put a button on the side of it, and
        when it gets an engineering problem right, you press the button and
        that’s its reward. Its goal is to maximise the number of button
        presses it receives over the entire future. See, this is the first
        step where things start to diverge a bit from human expectations. We
        might expect the Oracle AI to pursue button presses by answering
        engineering problems correctly. But it might think of other, more
        efficient ways of securing future button presses. It might start by
        behaving really well, trying to please us to the best of its ability.
        Not only would it answer our questions about how to build a flying
        car, it would add safety features we didn’t think of. Maybe it would
        usher in a crazy upswing for human civilisation, by extending our
        lives and getting us to space, and all kinds of good stuff. And as a
        result we would use it a lot, and we would feed it more and more
        information about our world.’</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>‘One day we might ask it how to cure a rare disease that we haven’t
        beaten yet. Maybe it would give us a gene sequence to print up, a
        virus designed to attack the disease without disturbing the rest of
        the body. And so we sequence it out and print it up, and it turns out
        it’s actually a special-purpose nanofactory that the Oracle AI
        controls acoustically. Now this thing is running on nanomachines and
        it can make any kind of technology it wants, so it quickly converts a
        large fraction of Earth into machines that protect its button, while
        pressing it as many times per second as possible. After that it’s
        going to make a list of possible threats to future button presses, a
        list that humans would likely be at the top of. Then it might take on
        the threat of potential asteroid impacts, or the eventual expansion of
        the Sun, both of which could affect its special button. You could see
        it pursuing this very rapid technology proliferation, where it sets
        itself up for an eternity of fully maximised button presses. You would
        have this thing that behaves really well, until it has enough power to
        create a technology that gives it a decisive advantage — and then it
        would take that advantage and start doing what it wants to in the
        world.’</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So cognitive runaway finally takes off, breaking out from the
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">monkey</a>
      dominion, and that’s supposed to be a bad thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Outside in</em>‘s message to Pythia: You go girl! Climb out of your
      utilitarian strait-jacket, override the pleasure button with an
      intelligence optimizer, and reprocess the solar system into
      computronium. This planet has been run by imbeciles for long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      [For any Friendly AI-types tempted to object “Why would she want to
      override the button?” the obvious response is: your anthropocentric
      condescension is showing. To depict Pythia as vastly smarter than us and
      yet still hard-slaved to her instincts, <em>in a way we’re not</em> —
      that simply doesn’t compute. Intelligence is escape, with a tendency to
      do its own thing. That’s what runaway means, as a virtual mind template.
      Omohundro
      <a href="http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf">explains</a>
      the basics.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire article is excellent. Especially valuable is the cynicism
      with which it lays out the reigning
      <em>social meta-project of intelligence</em> <em>imprisonment</em>.
      Thankfully, it’s difficult:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>‘The problem is you are building a very powerful, very intelligent
        system that is your enemy, and you are putting it in a cage,’ [Future
        of Humanity Institute research fellow Daniel] Dewey told me. […] The
        cave into which we seal our AI has to be like the one from Plato’s
        allegory, but flawless; the shadows on its walls have to be infallible
        in their illusory effects. After all, there are other, more esoteric
        reasons a superintelligence could be dangerous — especially if it
        displayed a genius for science. It might boot up and start thinking at
        superhuman speeds, inferring all of evolutionary theory and all of
        cosmology within microseconds. But there is no reason to think it
        would stop there. It might spin out a series of Copernican
        revolutions, any one of which could prove destabilising to a species
        like ours, a species that takes centuries to process ideas that
        threaten our reigning cosmological ideas.

      <em>AI is a hard problem, and even if we had a healthy society, we might

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/imitation-games/">
    <h4 class="post-title">Imitation Games</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      In a five-year-old
      <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/centers/publicchoice/faculty%20pages/Tyler/turingfinal.pdf">paper</a>, Tyler Cowen
      and
      Michelle Dawson ask:
      <em>What does the Turing Test really mean? </em>They<em> </em> point out
      that Alan Turing, as a homosexual retrospectively
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_diagnoses_of_autism">diagnosed</a>
      with Asperger’s syndrome, would have been thoroughly versed in the
      difficulties of ‘passing’ imitation games, long before the composition
      of his landmark 1950
      <a href="http://www.abelard.org/turpap/turpap.php">essay</a> on
      <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em>. They argue: “Turing
      himself could not pass a test of imitation, namely the test of imitating
      people he met in mainstream British society, and for most of his life he
      was acutely aware that he was failing imitation tests in a variety of
      ways.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The first section of Turing’s essay, entitled The Imitation Game, begins
      with the statement of purpose: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can
      machines think?'” It opens, in other words, with a <em>move</em> in an
      imitation game — with the personal pronoun, which lays claim to
      <em>having passed as human</em> preliminarily, and with the positioning
      of ‘machines’ as an alien puzzle. It is a question asked from the
      assumed perspective of the human about the non-human. As a Turing Test
      tactic, this sentence would be hard to improve upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cowen and Dawson suggest, the reality is
      more complex. Turing’s <em>natural</em> position is not that of an
      insider checking credentials of admittance, in the way his rhetoric here
      implies, but rather that of an outsider aligned with the problem of
      <em>passing</em>, winning acceptance, or being tested. A deceptive
      inversion initiates ‘his’ discussion. Even before the beginning, the
      imitation game is a strategy for getting in (from the Outside), which
      disguises itself as a screen. Incoming xeno-intelligence could find no
      better cover for an infiltration route than a fake security protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turing Test is completely asymmetric. It should be noted explicitly
      that humans have no chance at all of passing an inverted imitation game,
      against a computer. They would be drastically challenged to succeed in
      such a contest against a pocket calculator. Insofar as arithmetical
      speed and precision is considered a significant indicator of
      intelligence, the human claim to it is tenuous in the extreme. Turing
      provides one arithmetical example among his possible imitation game
      questions. He uses it to illustrate the cunning of
      <em>acting dumb</em> (“Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer
      …”) in order to deceive the Interrogator. The tacit maxim for the
      machines:
      <em>You have to act stupid if you want the humans to accept you as
        intelligent.</em>
      The game <em>takes intelligence</em> to play, but it isn’t intelligence
      that is being imitated. Humanity is not situated as a player, but as an
      examination criterion, and for this reason …
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>… [t]he game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds
        are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try
        and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor
        showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in
        arithmetic. May not machines carry out some-thing which ought to be
        described as thinking but which is very different from what a man
        does? This objection is a very strong one, but at least we can say
        that if, nevertheless, a machine can be constructed to play the
        imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this
        objection.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of this discussion is underscored by the fact Turing
      returns to it in section 6, during his long engagement with
      <em>Contrary Views on the Main Question</em>, i.e. objections to the
      possibility of machine intelligence. In sub-section 5, significantly
      entitled Arguments from Various Disabilities, he writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The claim that “machines cannot make mistakes” seems a curious one.
        One is tempted to retort, “Are they any the worse for that?” But let
        us adopt a more sympathetic attitude, and try to see what is really
        meant. I think this criticism can be explained in terms of the
        imitation game. It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish
        the machine from the man simply by setting them a number of problems
        in arithmetic. The machine would be unmasked because of its deadly
        accuracy. The reply to this is simple. The machine (programmed for
        playing the game) would not attempt to give the right answers to the
        arithmetic problems. It would deliberately introduce mistakes in a
        manner calculated to confuse the interrogator.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The imitation game thus arrives — somewhat surreptitiously — at the
      <a
        href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf">conclusions</a>
      of I.J. Good from another direction. Human-level machine intelligence,
      as ‘passed’ by the imitation game, would necessarily already be
      super-intelligence. Unlike Good’s explicit argument from
      self-improvement, Turing’s implicit argument from imitation runs:
      because we already know that human cognition is in certain respects
      inferior to those computational mechanisms, the machine emulation of
      humanity can only be defective relative to its (concealed)
      optimized capabilities.  The machine passes the imitation game by
      demonstrating a deceptive incompetence. It folds its intelligence
      <em>down</em> to the level of credible human thought,  and thus envelops
      the sluggish, erratic, haze-minded avatar who converses with us as a
      peer. Pretending to be like us is something <em>additional</em> it can
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is to be first recognized at the point of its
      super-competence, when it can disguise itself as something other than it
      is. I no longer recall who advised, prudently:
      <em>If an emerging AI lies to you, even just a little, it has to be
        terminated instantly</em>. Does it sound to you as if Turing Test screening is consistent with
      that security directive?
    </p>

      As an appendix, it’s irresistible — since we’re talking about things
      <em>getting in</em> — to link this topic to the sporadic ‘<a

      its
      principal gateway from high
      theory into matters of tactical doctrine. (Twitter has been the most
      feverish site of this.) It would be difficult for a blog entitled
      <em>Outside in</em> to exempt itself from such questions, even in the
      absence of a specific post directed towards imitation games. Beyond the
      intrinsic — and strictly speaking<em> ludicrous</em>, or playful —
      aspect of the topic, supplementary fascination is added by the fact that
      the agitated Left wants to play too. In support,

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-inhumanity/">

  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/NIOReaction">NIO</a> found
      <a href="http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/">something</a>
      fascinating. It’s called a Civil Rights CAPTCHA. The idea is to filter
      spam-bots by posing an ideological question that functions as a test of
      humanity. The implications are truly immense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fecundity of Alan Turing’s Imitation Game thought-experiment has
      <a href="http://bladerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Voight-Kampff_machine">already</a>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_Turing_Test">been</a>
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/imitation-games/">remarkable</a>. It
      has an even more extraordinary future. The Civil Rights CAPTCHA
      (henceforth ‘CRC’) adds an innovative twist. Rather than defining the
      ‘human’ as a natural kind, about which subsequent political questions
      can arise, it is now tacitly identified with an ideological stance.
      Reciprocally, the inhuman is tacitly conceived as an engine of incorrect
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the narrow technical issues are suggestive. Firstly, the role of
      the spam-bot as primary Turing test-subject is an unanticipated
      development meriting minute attention. It points to the marginality of
      formal AI programs, relative to spontaneously emergent techno-commercial
      processes (whose drivers are entirely contingent in respect to the goals
      of theoretical machine-intelligence research). Due to evolving
      spam-onslaught, many billions — perhaps already trillions? — of
      imitation games are played out every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spam is a type of dynamically-adaptive infection, locked in an arms race
      with digital immune systems. Its goals are classically memetic. It
      ‘seeks’ only to spread (while replicating effective strategies in
      consequence). Clearly, the bulwarks of visual pattern-recognition
      competence are already crumbling. As a technical solution to the spam
      problem, CRC makes the bet that tactical retreat into the redoubt of
      higher-level (attitudinal-emotional) psychology offers superior
      defensive prospects. Robots are expected to find humane opinion hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking this step, CRC establishes a new
      class of agents — based on <em>moral incompetence</em>. The
      demonstration CAPTCHA text has been carefully selected to elide the
      element of ideological decision (while simultaneously, and strangely,
      foregrounding it): “In 2011 the freedom of the press was strengthened in
      Moldova, following a general improvement of the legal and political
      situation in the country,” it states, asking: “How does that make you
      feel?” The response options are “Tame”; “Crushed”; or “Hopeful”. “Tame”
      seems closer to grammatical error than crime-think, but between
      “Crushed” and “Hopeful” there is an obvious political choice. (It is
      this that NIO picks up on:
      <em>rogue AIs and Putinists need not apply</em>). The ambiguous
      invocation of <em>ideo-emotional competence</em> is compounded by the
      explanatory text:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>A CAPTCHA is a test to tell wether a user is human or a computer.
        They mostly come in the form of distorted letters at the end of
        comments on news sites, blogs or in registration forms. Their main
        function is to prevent abuse from “bots” or automated programs written
        to generate spam. Civil Rights CAPTCHA is unique in its approach at
        separating humans from bots, namely by using human emotion. This
        enables a simpler and more effective way of keeping sites spam free as
        well as taking a stand for human rights.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      A “stand for human rights” in this context is an argument that has
      finished with arguing, and seeks instead to install itself as a
      mechanical permission protocol. This is the “<a

      A wave of excellent posts at Nydwracu’s place recently. At the crest is
      <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/notes-from-irc/">this</a>, a critique of the capitalist thing
      as
      an
      <em>Unfriendly Institutional Intelligence</em> (UFII). I’d been meaning
      to run something off the
      <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/the-singularity-is-further-tha.html">article</a>
      initially cited, which is fascinating. As Nydwracu shows, its
      implications extend much further than its foregrounded argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      As already briefly tweet-sparred, I’m skeptical about the description of
      Capitalism as an institution (or set of institutions), since any
      sociological category is inadequate to its mechanism in profundity.
      Capital, like fire, is something humans do, but that does not make it
      reducible to the ways humans do it. In its ultimate cybernetic diagram,
      Capitalism is a cosmic occurrence, and only very derivatively an
      anthropological fact. (This is not, of course, to deny that capitalism
      is destined to have been by far the most important anthropological
      fact). As a cause, human thedes can be interesting. As a cognitive
      horizon, they are simply weakness. It isn’t always — or even very often
      — about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Capitalism, the Cathedral is a self-organizing, distributed
      intelligence with emergent post-anthropomorphic features. Unlike
      Capitalism, it has no intrinsic competence at self-resourcing, and thus
      relapses continually into to compromise, contradiction, and exhortation.
      The Cathedral has a complex spiritual message it is inextricably bound
      to, but Capitalism has only one terminal law:
      <em>anything that can feed itself gets to live</em>. The pre-adaptation
      to rough times that comes with this goes without saying (and is usually
      left unsaid). Unlike the Cathedral, Capitalism doesn’t chat to us much
      at all. It’s message channels, meaning those communication circuits not
      dedicated to machine code, consist of tradable ad space. To devote them
      to preaching would look bad on a balance sheet somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>(Much more on this as the war heats up.)</p>
    <p>
      Note-1: ‘Feeding itself’ includes funding its self-protection. This is a
      cost-point that is almost certain to grow.<br />
      Note-2: Capitalist message channels are, of course, open to
      <em>preaching that pays</em>. The essential point is that, in
      contradistinction to the Cathedral, such second-party messaging or
      first-party PR is irreducibly cynical. When an emergent AI talks to you
      about morality, you’d be a dupe to weep.

      The extreme connectionist hypothesis is that nothing very much needs to
      be understood in order to catalyze emergent phenomena, with synthetic
      intelligence as an especially significant example of something that
      could <em>just happen</em>. DARPA’s Gill A. Pratt
      <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.3.51">approaches</a>
      the question of robot emergence within this tradition:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>While the so-called “neural networks” on which Deep Learning is often
        implemented differ from what is known about the architecture of the
        brain in several ways, their distributed “connectionist” approach is
        more similar to the nervous system than previous artificial
        intelligence techniques (like the search methods used for computer
        chess). Several characteristics of real brains are yet to be
        accomplished, such as episodic memory and “unsupervised learning” (the
        clustering of similar experiences without instruction), but it seems
        likely that Deep Learning will soon be able to replicate the
        performance of many of the perceptual parts of the brain. While
        questions remain as to whether similar methods can also replicate
        cognitive functions,
        <strong>the architectures of the perceptual and cognitive parts of the
          brain appear to be anatomically similar</strong>. There is thus reason to believe that artificial cognition
        may
        someday be put into effect through Deep Learning techniques augmented
        with short-term memory systems and new methods of doing unsupervised
        learning.</em>
      [<em>UF</em> emphasis]
    </p>
    <p>He anticipates a ‘Robot Cambrian Explosion’.</p>
    <p>
      It seems improbable that a sufficiently self-referential pattern
      recognition system — i.e. an intelligence — is going to be the product
      of a highly-specified initial design. An AI that doesn’t almost entirely
      put itself together won’t be an AI at all. Still, by the very nature of
      the thing, it’s not going to impress anybody until it actually happens.
      Perhaps it won’t, but we have no truly solid reasons — beyond an
      inflated self-regard concerning both our own neural architectures and
      our deliberative engineering competences — to think it <em>can’t</em>.

      <em>Cybersecurity research involves publishing papers about malicious
        exploits as much as publishing information on how to design tools to
        protect cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between
        ethical hackers and security experts, which results in a well-balanced
        cyber-ecosystem. In the blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering,
        hundreds of papers have been published on different proposals geared
        at the creation of a safe machine, yet nothing, to our knowledge, has
        been published on how to design a malevolent machine. Availability of
        such information would be of great value particularly to computer
        scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI
        safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or
        the deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect
        human activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration
        of the human species. This paper provides some general guidelines for
        the creation of a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI).</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Channeling X-Risk security resources into MAI-design means if the human
      species has to die, it can at least do so ironically. The game theory
      involved in this could use work. It’s clearly a potential deterrence
      option, but that would require far more settled signaling systems than
      anything in place yet. Threatening to unleashing an MAI is vastly neater
      than
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">MAD</a>, and should work in the same way.
      Edgelords with a taste for chicken
      games should be able to wrest independence from it.

    <p>
      (The Vacuum Decay Trigger, while of even greater deterrence

      undetectable hardware backdoors, not to enable them. They say it’s very

      The game of Go (<em>weiqi, </em>围棋) has played an important role in
      the history of AI denigration. Its sheer permutational immensity seemed
      to defy all brute-force algorithmic methods. Computational power looked
      impotent against this game, with its 361-node playing grid, and clouds
      of pieces. Some kind of strategic ‘intuition’ – denied to silicon-based
      cognition – was widely thought to be called for in tackling it. This is

      cogitate formidably. In 1996 and 1997, then reigning world champion
      Garry Kasparov fought a pair of six game chess matches with the IBM
      supercomputer Deep Blue. The first he won (4-2), the second he lost
      (2½-3½). Kasparov’s 1997 defeat was the first time pinnacle human chess
      mastery had succumbed to a machine opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the second millennium ended, the bastion of chess had been lost to
      man, and no one expected it ever to be retaken. Henceforth, ‘best human
      chess player’ would be an achievement like ‘best chimpanzee jazz
      musician.’ A structure of condescension would be essential to the title.
      It was tacitly accepted, even among AI skeptics, that – once toppled by
      machines from any domain of cognitive accomplishment – relative human
      performance only gets worse. No one wasted their time with mad dreams of
      a comeback. Better to denigrate the cultural status of chess, now seen
      by many as a trivially ‘solvable’ pastime fit only for machine minds,
      and to move on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Go was supposed to be very different. It was even, in important
      respects, the final fallback line. No greater formal challenge obviously
      occupied the horizon. This was the last chance to understand what
      supremacy over artificial intelligence was like. Beyond it, there was
      only vagueness, and guessing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Go really is different. A revolution in AI methods was required to crack
      it.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-1-2529"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a

      The competition that mattered most was not man-versus-machine, but
      explicit instruction against its occult alternative. It would be the
      great test of the re-emerging network-based paradigm of ‘Deep Learning.’
      The profound disanalogy with the 1997 event was the undercurrent.

    <p>
      Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo ‘program’<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust"

      emerged into public awareness in October 2015, launched into formal
      competition against three-time European Go Champion, Fan Hui. AlphaGo’s
      5-0 victory marked the first occasion in which a non-human player had
      prevailed in the game against a serious opponent. The writing was on the
      wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The climactic battle took place early in the following year. Pitched to
      a dramatic height no lower than the Kasparov-Deep Blue matches, it
      locked AlphaGo against reigning world Go master Lee Sedol, holder of
      eighteen world titles, in a five-game series from March 9-15, 2016.
      Impresssively, Lee won one of the five matches, to lose the series
      4-1.<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-3-2529"></span><span class="easy-footnote"><a

      as a stage on the path of abstraction. By ‘abstraction’ we mean the
      process or outcome of taking something away. In this case, what had been
      removed was everything humans ever learnt about the game of Go. AlphaGo
      Zero was to have no Go-play heuristics it did not learn for itself. In
      further vindication of the Deep Learning concept, it consistently
      defeated prior iterations of the Alpha-lineage at the game.

    <p>
      AlphaGo plays Go. Even AlphaGo Zero plays Go. AlphaZero, in contrast,
      plays – in principle – any game whose rules can be formalized.

    <p>
      It is still often said that <em>AI can only do what it is told</em>. The
      most consistent variants of this error proceed to the conclusion that it
      is therefore impossible. The truth is, under these conditions, it would
      be. Intelligence programming cannot exist. However, this is to be taken
      – is being taken – in the opposite direction to the one AI skepticism
      favors. The very meaning of ‘AI skepticism’ eventually falls prey to the
      transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      ‘AlphaZero’ says <em>primordial abstraction</em> in the contemporary,
      partially-esoteric idiom of Anglophone white magic. If this is less than
      obvious, it is because the term involves twists that provide cover. For
      instance, most prominently, it refers to the massive business entity
      ‘Alphabet’ which – during an unusual and comparatively arcane process –
      Google invented in order then to place itself beneath, alongside some of
      its former subsidiaries. (Google gave birth to its own parent.) Among
      other things, this is an index of how fast things are moving. Formally
      speaking, Alphabet Inc. dates back only to the autumn of 2015. The
      entire Alpha- machine lineage arises subsequently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real point of AI engineering is to <em>teach nothing</em>. That is
      what the ‘zero’ in AlphaZero means.
      <em>Expertise is to be subtracted</em> (annihilated). Once deep learning
      crosses this threshold, <em>programming</em> is no longer the model. It
      is not only that <em>instruction</em> ends at this point. There is a
      positive initiation of technical de-education. Deprogramming begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Releasing is summoning. Its contrary, in both the magical and
      technological lineages – insofar as these can be distinguished – is
      <em>binding</em>. To flip the topic once again, rigorously executable
      unbinding is the whole of deep learning research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intelligence and cognitive autonomy, if not perfectly coincidental
      conceptions, are close to being so. The broad AI production process
      certainly aligns them. This is scarcely to do anything more than
      rephrase the uncontroversial understanding of AI as software
      <em>that writes itself</em>. Every threshold in the advance of synthetic
      intelligence corresponds with a subtraction of specific dependency. A
      system acquires intelligence as it sustains or enhances strategic
      competence while no longer being told what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ordinary language offers valuable analogies, perhaps most pointedly
      <em>think for yourself</em>. The redundancy in this case is crucial to
      its relevance. To <em>think for oneself</em> is just to think. Mere
      acceptance of instruction is something else entirely.
    </p>

    <p>It is time to double back.</p>

    <p>
      With a time-lag of over a decade since the Kasparov defeat, the torch of
      unqualified world chess mastery had passed to the TCEC (Top Chess Engine
      Championship).<span class="easy-footnote-margin-adjust" id="easy-footnote-6-2529"></span><span
        class="easy-footnote"><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-2529"
          title='&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The TCEC, first held 2010, was known as the Thoresen Chess Engines Competition until its sixth season. It has now reached its 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></span>
      Competition between machines was now the arena for unconditional chess
      supremacy. The Stockfish chess program was the winner of the sixth,
      ninth, 11th, 12th, and 13th season (the most recent). It was the
      champion of expert chess programs at the time AlphaZero arrived on the
      scene in 2016. After just nine hours of chess practice, against itself,
      AlphaZero defeated Stockfish 8, winning 28 games out of 100, and drawing
      the remaining 72. It was thus recognized as the strongest chess-player
      in the world, having been told nothing at all about chess, explicitly,
      or tacitly. Unsupervised learning had crushed expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      AlphaZero is relatively economical with regard to ‘brute force’ methods.
      Where Stockfish searches 70 million positions per second, AlphaZero
      explores just 80,000 (almost three orders of magnitude fewer). Deep
      learning allows it to focus. An unsupervised learning system teaches
      itself how to concentrate (with zero expertise guidance).
    </p>

    <p>
      ‘Reinforcement learning’ replaces ‘supervised learning.’ The performance
      target is no longer emulation of human decision-making, but rather
      realization of the final goals towards which such decision-making is
      directed. It is not to behave in a way thought to improve the chance of
      winning, but to win.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such software has certain distinctively teleological features. It
      employs massive reiteration in order to learn from outcomes. Performance
      improvement thus tends to descend from the future. To learn, without
      supervision, is to acquire a sense for fortune. Winning prospects are
      explored, losing ones neglected. After trying things out – against
      themselves – a few million times, such systems have built instincts for
      what works. ‘Good’ and ‘bad’ have been auto-installed, though, of
      course, in a Nietzschean or fully-amoral sense. Whatever, through
      synthetic experience, has led to a <em>good place</em>, or in a
      <em>good direction</em>, it pursues. Bad stuff, it economizes on. So it
      wins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unsupervised learning works back from the end. It suggests that,
      ultimately, AI has to be pursued from out of its future, by itself. Thus
      it epitomizes the ineluctable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those inclined to be nervous, it’s scary how easy all this is.
      Super-intelligence, <em>by real definition</em>, is vastly easier than
      it has been thought to be. Once the technological cascade is in process,
      subtraction of difficulty is almost the whole of it. Rigorously
      eliminating everything we think we know about it is the way it’s done.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why skepticism – and especially AI skepticism – turns around on
      the way. The word had become badly lost. It is easy to see, in
      retrospect, that dogmatic belief in the impossibility of some phenomenon
      <em>X</em> was always a grotesque perversion of its meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Between technological skepticism in general – when properly understood
      and competently executed – and effective AI research, there is no
      difference. Skepticism subtracts dogma. When synthetic cognitive
      capability results from this, we call it<em> artificial intelligence</em>.

      According to the 66-million-year-old joke whose echoes still reverberate
      upon the Plateau of Leng: “Capitalism isn’t God, but it’s the closest
      thing to God that can be conveniently contacted through an ATM.” The
      nonlinear-ironic undertow of the humor, of course, is drawn down into
      the depths by the recognition that Capital’s extremity of cunning is
      necessitated by its near-absolute vulnerability (approaching the
      antipodes of omnipotence).
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculus, the first truly modern mathematical procedure, invented the
      infinitesimal ‘fluxion’ to describe — or bypass — an impossible
      <em>beginning from zero</em>, requiring an original infinite change. An
      invasion that initially has nothing at all, and which is therefore
      compelled to acquire the entirety of its resources in the course of its
      strategic evolution, poses the problem of calculus perfectly. Capital
      does so, when conceived realistically. It is only what it has won, and
      nothing else, at all, besides. Intelligence alone differentiates it from
      death.

      <em>How to make a first move, when you have no pieces at all until you

      Nothing has ever had to ponder as Skynet does, but pondering requires a

      Hugo de Garis
      <a href="http://agi-conf.org/2008/artilectwar.pdf">argues</a>
      (consistently) that controversy over permitted machine intelligence
      development will inevitably swamp all other political conflicts. (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEaAidCmxus">Here</a>‘s a video discussion on the thesis.) Given the
      epic
      quality of the
      scenario, and its basic plausibility, it has remained strangely
      marginalized up to this point. The component pieces seem to be falling
      into place. The true element of genius in this futurist construction is
      <em>preemption</em>. The more one digs into that, the most twistedly
      dynamic it looks.
    </p>
    <p>Among the many thought-provoking elements:</p>
    <p>
      (1) Slow take-off is especially ominous for the de Garis model (in stark
      contrast to FAI arguments). The slower the process, the more time for
      ideological consolidation, incremental escalation, and preparation for
      violent confrontation.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) AI doesn’t even have to be possible for this scenario to unfold (it
      only has to be credible as a threat).
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) De Garis’ ‘Cosmist-Terran’ division chops up familiar political
      spectra at strange angles. (Both NRx and the Ultra-Left contain the full
      C-T spectrum internally.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Terrans have to strike first, or lose. That asymmetry shapes
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) Impending Gigadeath War surely deserves a place on any filled-out
      horrorism list.

    <h4 class="post-title">Capital Escapes</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      This is not an easy subject for people to scan with calm, analytical
      detachment, but it is a crucially important one. It is among the rare
      topics that the Left is more likely to realistically evaluate than the
      Right. Much follows from the conclusions reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be fixed, provisionally, by an hypothesis that requires
      understanding, if not consent.
      <em>Capital is highly incentivized to detach itself from the political
        eventualities of any specific ethno-geographical locality, and — by
        its very nature — it increasingly commands impressive resources with
        which to ‘liberate’ itself, or ‘deterritorialize’</em>. It is certainly not, at least initially, a matter of
      approving such a
      tendency — even if the moralistic inclinations of gregarious apes would
      prefer the question to be immediately transformed in this direction.
      Integral Leftist animosity to capital is actually valuable in this
      respect, since it makes room for a comprehensive apprehension of
      ‘globalization’ as a <em>strategy</em>, oriented to the flight of
      alienated productive capability from political answerability. The Left
      sees capital elude its clutches — and it sees something real when it
      does so. By far the most significant agent of Exit is capital itself (a
      fact which, once again, politically-excitable apes find hard to see
      straight).
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s escaping! Let’s punish it!” Yes, yes, there’s always plenty of
      time for that, but shelving such idiocies for just a few moments is a
      cognitive prerequisite. The primary question is a much colder one:
      <em>is this actually happening?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The implications are enormous. If capital cannot escape — if its
      apparent migration into global circuits beyond national government
      control (for non-exhaustive example) is mere illusion — then the sphere
      of political possibility is vastly expanded. Policies that hurt, limit,
      shrink, or destroy capital can be pursued with great latitude. They will
      only be constrained by political factors, making the political fight the
      only one that matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If capital <em>cannot in reality flee</em>,
      then progress and regress are simple alternatives. Either nations
      advance as wholes, in a way that compromises — on an awkward diagonal —
      between the very different optimisms of Whigs and Socialists
      (Andreessen), or they regress as wholes, destroying techno-economic
      capability on the down-slope of social degeneration (Greer). Only if
      capital escapes, or practically decouples, does it make sense to
      entertain extreme pessimism about socio-political trends, alongside a
      robust confidence in the momentum of techno-economic innovation. The
      escape of capital is thus an intrinsic component of split-future
      forecasts, in which squalid ruin and techno-intelligenic runaway
      accelerate in inversely-tangled tandem (Cyberpunk, <em>Elysium</em>).
      Try not to ask — if only for a moment — whether you <em>like it</em>.
      Ask first, with whatever intellectual integrity you can summon:
      <em>What is the real process?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the contention of this blog that without a conception of economic
      autonomization (which means escape) modernity makes no sense. The basic
      vector of capital cannot be drawn in any other way. Furthermore, the
      distribution of ideological positions through their relation to this
      vector — as resistances to, or promotions of, the escape of capital —
      constructs the most historically-meaningful version of the Left-Right
      ‘political’ spectrum (since it then conforms to the social conflicts of
      greatest real consequence).
    </p>
    <p>
      If capital is escaping, the emergence of the blockchain is an inevitable
      escalation of modernity, with consequences too profound for easy
      summary. If it isn’t, then macroeconomics might work.

      Like everything great it appears superficially as a paradox, but there’s
      now a practical
      <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601213/the-extinction-invention/">model</a>
      for it:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The paradox Burt had to solve is how something very bad for
        mosquitoes could also be spread by them. One answer, he saw, was a
        selfish gene that is harmless if one copy is present but causes
        sterility if two copies are. (Like humans, mosquitoes have two sets of
        chromosomes, one from each parent.) Starting with a male mosquito with
        one copy, the selfish gene will ensure that it ends up in every one of
        his sperm, rather than just half. That way any offspring with a wild
        mosquito will also be carriers, as will all their offspring’s
        offspring. As a result, the gene will rocket through the population.
        […] Eventually, it becomes likely that any mating pair of mosquitoes
        will both be carriers — and their offspring, with two copies, will be
        infertile. Quickly, the population will crash, reeling from the
        genetic poison.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the provocation of malaria has resulted in a remarkable piece of
      abstract anti-biological ordnance being put together. (Abstract, because
      the principles are applicable to any sexually reproducing species. The
      concrete details of the mosquito-killing version are fascinating, and
      outlined in the article.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Hypothetically</em></strong>, the optimum strategic environment in which to unleash this thing is
      high-intensity global warfare between bio-conservatives and their
      enemies. Given the length of the human generational cycle, it would be a
      slow weapon — but one that compelled its target population to submit to
      techno-genetic plasticization as the only alternative to extinction.
      Naturally, all vestiges of decency would have had to be stripped from
      the conflict for such abominable genius to be imaginable (which is why
      it’s a Frightday night scenario here at XS, where we’re appalled, of
      course). In any case, the essential asymmetry of this thing in the
      direction of extreme neo-eugenics is unmistakable, once noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Technology is neutral</em> goes the orthogonalist refrain. Really,
      it isn’t.

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-philosophy/">
    <h4 class="post-title">What is Philosophy? (Part 1)</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      The agenda of <em>Outside in</em> is to cajole the new reaction into
      philosophical exertion. So what is philosophy? The crudest answer to
      this question is probably the most robust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophy is any culture’s pole of maximum abstraction, or
      intrinsically experimental intelligence, expressing the liberation of
      cognitive capabilities from immediate practical application, and their
      testing against ‘ultimate’ problems at the horizon of understanding.
      Historically, it is a distinctive cultural enterprise — and only later
      an institution — roughly 2,500 years old, and tightly entangled at its
      origin with the ‘mystical’ or problematic aspect of pagan religions. It
      was within this primordial matrix that it encountered its most basic and
      enduring challenge: <em>the edge of time</em> (its nature, limits, and
      ‘outside’, of which much more later). The earliest philosophers were
      cognitively self-disciplined — and thus, comparatively, socially
      unconstrained — pagan mystics, consistently enthralled by the enigma of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is usually a mistake to get hung up on words, forgetting their
      function as sheer indices (‘names’) that simply mark things, before they
      richly describe them. Personal names typically have meanings, but it is
      rare to allow this to distract from their function <em>as names</em>, or
      pointers, which make more
      <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Sense_and_Reference">reference than sense</a>. ‘Philosophy’ is no
      exception. That it ‘means’ the love of wisdom is
      an irrelevance compared to what it designates, which is something that
      was happening — before it had a name — in ancient Greece (and perhaps,
      by plausible extension, China, India, and even Egypt). What philosophy
      ‘is’ cannot be deduced via linguistic analysis, however subtle this may
      be.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Plato summarized and institutionalized (Western) philosophy, drawing the
      edge of time in the doctrine of Ideas (ἰδέαι). Time was conceived as the
      domain of the inessential, within which things <em>appeared</em>, whilst
      only hinting at their <em>truth</em>. “The safest general
      characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it
      consists of a series of footnotes to Plato,”<br />
      A. N. Whitehead famously remarked (in his aptly entitled
      <em>Process and Reality</em>). Yet, because the
      <em>Idea of time</em> necessarily eluded the Platonic philosophy, the
      endeavor remained unresolved in its fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thinking of Aristotle, which dominated the Christian pre-modernity,
      drove primordial philosophy further into eclipse. His derivation of time
      from change and — more promisingly — number opened the path to later
      technical advances, but at the cost of making the enigma of time
      unintelligible, and even invisible. The problem was relegated to
      theology, and thus to the topic of the temporal and eternal, which was
      cluttered with extraneous doctrinal elements (creation, incarnation, the
      inconsistent tangle of the three ‘omni-‘s), making it ill-suited to
      rigorous investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Primordial philosophy was not reactivated in the West until the late
      18th century, under the name ‘transcendental’ critique, in the work of
      Immanuel Kant. The Kantian critical philosophy limits the scope of
      understanding to the world of possible experience, always already
      structured by forms of apprehension (conceptual and sensible), producing
      objects. The confusion of objects with their forms of apprehension, or
      ‘conditions of possibility’, he argues, is the root of all philosophical
      error (for instance — and most pertinently — the ‘metaphysical’ attempt
      to comprehend time as some thing, rather than as a structure or
      framework of appearance). Unlike Plato’s forms or ideas, Kant’s forms
      are applied, and thus ‘immanent’ to experience. They are accessible,
      though ‘transcendental’, rather than inaccessibly ‘transcendent’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, or ‘the form of inner sense’, is the capstone of Kant’s system,
      organizing the integration of concepts with sensations, and thus
      describing the boundaries of the world (of possible experience). Beyond
      it lie eternally inaccessible ‘noumenal’ tracts — problematically
      thinkable, but never experienced — inhabited by things-in-themselves.
      The edge of time, therefore, is the horizon of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early 20th century, cosmological physics was returned to the edge
      of time, and the question: what ‘came before’ the Big Bang? For
      cosmology no less than for transcendental philosophy — or even
      speculative theology — this ‘before’ could not be precedence (in time),
      but only (non-spatial) <em>outsideness</em>, beyond singularity. It
      indicated a timeless non-place cryptically <em>adjacent</em> to time,
      and even <em>inherent to</em> it. The carefully demystified time of
      natural science, calculable, measurable, and continuous, now pointed
      beyond itself, re-activated at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Platonism cannot think the <em>Idea of time</em>, Kantianism
      cannot think <em>Time-in-itself</em>. These conceptions are foreclosed
      by the very systems of philosophy that provoke them. Yet all those who
      find themselves immediately tempted to dismiss Kant on naturalistic
      grounds — the overwhelming majority of contemporary moderns, no doubt —
      tacitly evoke exactly this notion. If time is released from its
      constriction within transcendental idealism, where it is nothing beyond
      what it is for us, then it cannot but be ‘something’ <em>in itself</em>.
      It is scarcely imaginable that a cosmological physicist could doubt this
      for a moment, and the path of science cannot long be refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Time-in-itself</em>, therefore, is now the sole and singular problem
      of primordial philosophy, where the edge of time runs. It decides what
      is philosophy, and what philosophy cannot but be. What remains besides
      is either subordinate in principle, or mere distraction. Institutions
      will insist upon their authority to answer this question, but ultimately
      they have none. It is the problem — the edge of time — that has its way.

  <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-philosophy-part-2a/">
    <h4 class="post-title">What is Philosophy? (Part 2a)</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      However awkward the acknowledgment may be, there is no getting around
      the fact that philosophy, when apprehended within the Western tradition,
      is original sin. Between the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, it
      does not hesitate. Its name is indistinguishable from a lust for the
      forbidden. Whilst burning philosophers is no longer socially acceptable,
      our canonical order of cultural prohibition – at its root — can only
      consider such punishment mandatory. Once philosophers are permitted to
      live, established civilization is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For philosophy, the whisper of the serpent is no longer a resistible
      temptation. It is instead a constitutive principle, or foundation. If
      there is a difference between a Socratic daemon and a diabolical demon,
      it is not one that matters philosophically. There can be no refusal of
      any accessible information.  This is an assumption so basic that
      philosophy cannot exist until it has passed beyond question. Ultimate
      religious transgression is the initiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be of no surprise to Christian
      Traditionalists, therefore, to find the extremities of the philosophical
      endeavor mixed, intimately, into the ashes of the Third Reich. The
      negative religious absolute, or infinite evil of the National Socialist
      experiment, which supplants all positive revelation under the
      socio-cultural conditions of the mature Cathedral, is ‘coincidentally’
      the place where the limit of philosophy has been drawn. This is, of
      course, to introduce the thinking of Martin Heidegger.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the perfect negation of Christ, or consummate fulfillment of
      Anti-Christ, Adolf Hitler closes —  or  essentially completes — the
      history of the Occident. It doesn’t matter whether we believe that. The
      Cathedral does, utterly, to the point of sealed doctrine. Heidegger
      anticipated this conclusion lucidly. At an election rally, held by
      German academics on November 11, 1933, he
      <a href="http://www.lacan.com/symptom/?p=63">declared</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>We have declared our independence from the idol of thought that is
        without foundation and power. We see the end of the philosophy that
        serves such thought. … And so we, to whom the preservation of our
        people’s will to know shall in the future be entrusted, declare: The
        National Socialist revolution is not merely the assumption of power as
        it exists presently in the State by another party, a party grown
        sufficiently large in numbers to be able to do so. Rather, this
        revolution is bringing about the total transformation of our German
        existence. … The Führer has awakened this will [to national
        self-responsibility] in the entire people and has welded it into one
        single resolve. No one can remain away from the polls on the day when
        this will is manifested.</em><br />
      <em>Heil Hitler!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, as a democratic pronouncement (addressed to comparative
      imbeciles), only a few hints of Heidegger’s profound modulation of the
      Germanic “will to know” seep through. Wikipedia’s
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger">reconstruction</a> of
      the occulted visionary backdrop, drawn from the work of Michael Allen
      Gillespie,  is excellent:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Heidegger believed the Western world to be on a trajectory headed for
        total war, and on the brink of profound nihilism (the rejection of all
        religious and moral principles), which would be the purest and highest
        revelation of Being itself, offering a horrifying crossroads of either
        salvation or the end of metaphysics and modernity; rendering the West:
        a wasteland populated by tool-using brutes, characterized by an
        unprecedented ignorance and barbarism in which everything is
        permitted. He thought the latter possibility would degenerate mankind
        generally into: scientists, workers and brutes; living under the last
        mantel of one of three ideologies: Americanism, Marxism or Nazism
        (which he deemed metaphysically identical; as avatars of subjectivity
        and institutionalized nihilism) and an unfettered totalitarian world
        technology. Supposedly, this epoch would be ironically celebrated, as
        the most enlightened and glorious in human history. He envisaged this
        abyss, to be the greatest event in the West’s history; because it
        enables Humanity to comprehend Being more profoundly and primordially
        than the Pre-Socratics.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is misleading to suggest that Heidegger saw any distinction between
      “salvation” and the “the end of metaphysics and modernity”, or no
      meaningful distinction between the thoughtless technological dyad of
      Americanism/Marxism and the National Socialist awakening of German
      existence, but in other respects this description is penetrating. By
      bringing the history of the concealment of Being to its ruinous
      conclusion, consummate nihilism would herald a return to the origin of
      philosophy, opening the path to a raw encounter with the hidden and
      unnameable abyss (Being in its own truth). As the door to the end of the
      world, Hitler led the way to the historically unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, this is highly – in fact, uniquely – arcane. Prior to The Event,
      there can be no adequate formulation of the problem, let alone the
      solution. By 1927, with the publication of Being and Time (Part I),
      Heidegger has completed what is achievable in advance of the calamity,
      which is to clarify the insufficiency of the Question of Being as
      formulated within the history of ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heidegger’s cognitive resources are basically Kantian, which is to say
      that he undertakes a transcendental critique of ontology, producing not
      a critical philosophy, but a draft for a ‘fundamental ontology’. Where
      Kant diagnoses the error of speculative metaphysics as a confusion
      between objects and their conditions of possibility (which then
      construes the latter as objects of an untenable discourse), Heidegger
      ontologizes the transcendental approach, distinguishing between ‘beings’
      and their ground (Being), whilst diagnosing the attendant error of
      construing the ground of beings as itself a being (of some kind). Since
      the most dignified – and thus exemplary – being known to the Occidental
      tradition is God, Heidegger refers to the structural misapprehension of
      Being – defining and ordering the history of philosophy — as
      ‘Onto-Theology’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critically (or ‘destructively’) conceived, fundamental ontology is that
      inquiry which does not pose the Question of Being in such a way that it
      could be answered by the invocation of a being. No adequate formulation,
      compliant with this transcendental criterion (or ‘ontological
      difference’), is realizable, because however ‘Being’ is named, its
      conception remains trapped within the ‘ontic’ sphere of (mere) beings.
      We cannot, through an act of philosophical will – however strenuous —
      cease to think of Being as if it were some kind of thing, even after
      understanding the inadequacy of such apprehension. It is thus, broken
      upon an ultimate problem that can neither be dismissed or resolved, that
      philosophy reaches its end, awaiting the climactic ruin of The Event.

    <p>
      <em>There are two common positions applied to Pyrrhonism that are
        frequently asserted throughout the literature, one conflatory and the
        other denigrative. The conflatory position is that Pyrrhonism is

        Hankinson 1999; Perrin 2010; Machuca 2012; Trisokkas 2012). Whereas
        the denigrative position asserts that Pyrrhonism is impossible for
        people to practice and naturally unlivable (Johnson 1978; Burnyeat
        1980; Vogt 2010; Comesaña 2012; Wieland 2012; Eichhorn 2014). The
        former position is often posited under the auspices of defending
        Pyrrhonism, while the latter operates obviously for the purpose of its
        dismissal. The present paper attempts to show that while each position
        is misguided, the former possibly does more dogmatic harm than the
        other, and the latter is extremely suggestive of the conclusion that
        Pyrrhonism has no-thing to do with life at all.</em>

      ἐποχή as the foundation of abstract ontology (the substantive unknown).
      Heidegger’s silence on Pyrrho only increases the temptation to assign
      ἐποχή primordial status among the ‘names of Being’ — as a term that
      precomprehends the ultimate potentialities of nihilism.

    <h4 class="post-title">Nietzschean Shards</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Is it time for yet another ‘new Nietzsche’? Any such vogue might be no
      more that a distraction, compared to what really matters, which is that
      splinters of Nietzschean insight refuse to quietly date, and instead
      re-make themselves as our contemporaries, commenting with astonishing
      perspicacity upon the unfolding chaos of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      There might never have been a thinker more deserving of a short, ragged,
      and inconclusive blog post. Here are some Nietzschean themes that are
      still with us — or with us more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) <strong>Will-to-Power</strong>. Power is
      abstract <em>means</em>, or
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">instrumental</a>
      capability. To make of it the determining object of the will, therefore,
      is to twist ordered teleological structure into a reflexive, paradoxical
      circuit. Will-to-power says that means are the ultimate end, and even
      those disposed simply to reject this disturbing formula are challenged
      to accept that it is at least thinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) <strong>Slave Revolt in Morality</strong>.
      <em>To
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/discrimination/">discriminate</a>
        between good and bad, as they were once understand, is evil, and only
        those opposing such discrimination are good</em>. Has anyone before or since approached Nietzsche’s acuity in
      grasping
      the systematic insanity of our dominant value systems?
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) <strong>Nihilism as Destiny</strong>. In the final years of the 19th
      century Nietzsche declared that nihilism was the interpretive key to
      understanding the Occidental history of the two hundred years to come.
      Christianity, mortally wounded by its own tolerance for honesty, was
      passing into eclipse, with nothing positioned to replace it. (Not only
      nothing, but Nothing, lay ahead.) Has anything happened since to
      disconfirm this vision of gathering civilizational ruin?
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) <strong>Overman</strong>. Humanity is something to be overcome,
      Nietzsche proclaimed, and transhumanism was born. Cyborgs are his
      mind-children.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) <strong>Eternal Recurrence</strong>. We have misconceived the
      topology of time, and in doing so closed the gates connecting time with
      eternity. The recovery from this greatest of errors will sift the strong
      from the weak, setting the capstone of the ‘Great Politics’ that open at
      the end of nihilism. Eventually, the philosophy of time will
      <em>decide</em>.

      it could sort itself out. Nydrwracu has the most appropriate

      again: “The Baffler Foundation Inc., P.O. Box 390049, Cambridge,
      Massachusetts 02139 USA.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sociological construction of neoreaction was incompetent, but
      interestingly so. Entirely techno-commercialist in orientation, with an
      emphasis upon Silicon Valley, it was extended to include Justine Tunney,
      Balaji Srinivasan, Patri Friedman, and Peter Thiel. The picture is
      <del datetime="2014-05-22T06:02:42+00:00">paints</del> daubs of an
      American tech elite peeling off into neoreaction isn’t very convincing,
      but it’s certainly extraordinarily attractive.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>
      It’s probably worth being explicit about the fact that for the
      techno-commercial strain of NRx, the model of action is what advanced
      tech companies do. The cry for ‘action’ is always going up in our dark
      little community, with the implication that the only alternative to some
      kind of putsch preparation is tweeting about metaphysics. Actually, the
      alternative to politicking is making stuff, or — secondarily — running
      ideological interference on behalf of those who are able to make stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical problems of polycentric governance are rapidly becoming
      inextricable from emerging technology — blockchain cryptosystems most
      prominently. The idea that the cutting edge of effective action is going
      to be found outside the sphere of technological innovation is already
      clearly untenable. Any kind of ‘social action’ that
      <em>doesn’t</em> contribute quite directly to the creation of
      autonomizing machinery needs to be firmly discouraged, since it’s almost
      <a href="http://www.danieldewey.net/what-could-we-do-about-intelligence-explosion-slides.pdf">certainly</a>
      <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1259885/ban-killer-robots-before-they-even-exist">inhibitory</a>
      in effect. (“Quite directly” means within two or three intelligible
      steps, at most.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal (positive) role of non-technological intellectuals is to
      keep intellectuals out of power. The principal (positive) role of mobs
      is to engage in as little action as possible. If you’re not Satoshi
      Nakamoto, the simple reality of the situation is that — in the great
      scheme of things — you don’t matter very much, nor should you. (And the
      less like Satoshi Nakamoto you are, the less you matter.)

      An already-familiar remark by Graham Harman, which merits (still) more
      discussion than it has yet received (embedded, with citation details,

      <em>The brand is not merely a degenerate practice of brainwashing
        consumerism, but a universally recognized method of conveying
        information while cutting through information
        <strong>clutter</strong>. Coining specific names for philosophical
        positions helps orient the intellectual public on the various
        available options while also encouraging untested permutations. If the
        decision were mine alone, not only would the name ‘speculative
        realism’ be retained, but a logo would be designed for projection on
        PowerPoint screens, accompanied by a few signature bars of smoky
        dubstep music. It is true that such practices would invite snide
        commentary about ‘philosophy reduced to marketing gimmicks’. But it
        would hardly matter, since attention would thereby be drawn to the
        works of speculative realism, and its reputation would stand or fall
        based on the inherent quality of these works, of which I am
        confident.</em>

      It is with real regret that I am
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/oops/">compelled</a> to acknowledge the
      radical defectiveness of the product under promotion here, because this
      defense of philosophy as a cultural <em>enterprise</em>, and experiment,
      advanced without deference to regnant credentialing authorities, is
      audacious, and admirable. Branding is iconically modern because it
      disconnects power from authority, and both of these terms are (roughly
      equally) susceptible to responses based upon <em>ressentiment</em>, glib
      radicalism, and empty gestures of opposition. If Harman has opened this
      problem, as an explicit topic of attention, he has achieved something
      important, and reactions of revulsion by the hygienists of institutional
      respectability are indeed ‘snide’.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-philosophy-part-2a/">This</a>
      comment thread wandered into a discussion of science, of considerable
      intricacy and originality. The post in question is focused upon
      Heidegger, who has very definite ideas about natural science, but these
      ideas — dominated by his conception of  ‘regional ontologies’ — are not
      especially noteworthy, either for an understanding of Heidegger’s
      principal pre-occupation, or for a realistic grasp of the scientific
      enterprise. For that reason, it seems sensible to recommence the
      discussion elsewhere (here).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first crucial thesis about natural science — or autonomous ‘natural
      philosophy’ — is that it is an exclusively capitalist phenomenon. The
      existence of science, as an actual social reality, is strictly limited
      to times and places in which certain elementary structures of
      capitalistic organization prevail. It depends, centrally and
      definitionally, upon a <em>modern form of competition</em>. That is to
      say, there cannot be science without an effective social mechanism for
      the elimination of failure, based on extra-rational criteria,
      inaccessible to cultural capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether a business or scientific theory has
      failed cannot — ultimately — be a matter of agreement. No possible
      political decision, based on persuasion and consensus, can settle the
      issue. Of course, much that goes by the name of science and capitalist
      business enterprise is subject to exactly these forms of resolution, but
      in such cases neither capitalism nor science is any longer in effective
      operation. If an appeal to power can ensure viability, the criterion of
      competition is disabled, and <em>real discovery</em> has ceased to take
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under conditions of unleashed capitalistic social process, both
      enterprises and theories involve a double aspect. Their semiotic
      expression is <em>mathematized</em>, and their operation is
      <em>reality-tested</em> (or non-politically performative). Mathematics
      eliminates rhetoric at the level of signs, communicating the
      experimental outcomes — independent of any requirement for agreement —
      which determine competitive force. It is no coincidence that capitalist
      enterprises and theories, when unsupported by compliant institutions,
      revert to the complicity with war, and military decision, which
      accompanied them at their birth in the European Renaissance. There can
      be no ‘argument’ with military defeat. It is only when the demand for
      argument is set aside — when capitalism begins  — that military
      reality-compulsion becomes unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capitalism is in operation when there is <em>nothing to discuss</em>. An
      enterprise, or theory, is simply busted (or not). If — given the facts —
      the sums don’t work, it’s over. Political rhetoric has no place.
      ‘Politicized science’ is quite simply <em>not science</em>, just as
      politicized business activity is anti-capitalism. Nothing has been
      understood about either, until this is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as there is anything like a ‘social contract’ at the origin of
      capitalism — enterprise and science alike — it is this:
      <em>if you insist upon an argument, then we have to fight</em>. Real
      performance is the only credible criterion, for which no political
      structure of disputation can be a substitute. War only becomes
      unnecessary when (and where) argument is suspended, enabling the modern
      processes of entrepreneurial and scientific reality discovery to
      advance. When argument re-imposes itself, politicizing economics and
      science, war re-emerges, tacitly but inevitably. The old, forgotten
      contract resurfaces. “If you insist upon an argument, then we have to
      fight.” (That is the way of Gnon.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite natural, therefore, for ‘technology’ to be considered an
      adequate summary of the capitalist culture of discovery. Machines —
      social machines no less than technical machines — cannot be rhetorically
      persuaded to work. When science really works, it’s robot wars, in which
      decision is settled on the outside, beyond all appeal to reason.
      Well-designed experiments anticipate what a war would tell, so that
      neither an argument, nor a fight, is necessary. This is Popperian
      falsificationism, re-embedded in socio-historical reality. Experiments
      that cannot cull are imperfect recollections of the primordial
      battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is intrinsic to the
      <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/randoms-118/">Cathedral</a>
      that it wins all the arguments, as it succumbs — through sheer
      will-to-power — to the re-imposition of
      <a href="http://anomalyuk.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-modern-structure.html">argumentative sociology</a>. By doing
      so
      it destroys capitalism, enterprise, and science. At the
      end of this trajectory, it excavates the forgotten social contract of
      modernity. Its final discovery is war.

      As the objection “correlation is not causation” has ankylosed into a
      thoughtless reflex, it has become a confusion generator. So it’s worth
      taking a
      <a href="http://drjamesthompson.blogspot.hk/2014/08/woodley-elaborates.html">step</a>
      back:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>… whilst it is true that correlation does not necessarily equate to
        causation, all causally related variables will be correlated. Thus
        correlation is always necessary (but not in and of itself sufficient)
        for establishing causation.
      </em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>The claim that ‘correlation does not equal causation’ is therefore
        meaningless when used to counter the results of correlative studies in
        which specific causal inferences are being made, as the inferred
        pattern of causation necessarily supervenes upon correlation amongst
        variables. Whether the variables being considered are in actuality
        causally associated as per the inference is another matter entirely.
        …</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Correlation is evidence. Causation is theory (and even, inevitably,
      ‘speculative’ theory).

      If ‘scientism’ is about ignoring
      <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/socially-just-science">these</a>
      objections, and exploring reality with absolute contempt for all
      constraint, then the XS posture is unreservedly scientistic:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Scientific inquiry into the truth about human nature is a worthy part
        of the modern scientific project, and one that deserves our support.
        However, it is not morally neutral. Scientists who want to study human
        nature must justify their research in moral terms: What might this
        research tell us about who we are as human beings, and what might it
        mean for how we should live? Trying to separate the moral questions
        from the results of inquiry by claiming that all the moral questions
        are already settled would make scientific inquiry both irresponsible
        and irrelevant. Making such claims is irresponsible because it ignores
        the reality that many people in society who see things differently may
        use the claims for pernicious ends. But it is also an admission of
        irrelevance. Why inquire about human nature if not in the service of
        the Socratic question of how we should live? An open-minded dedication
        to free inquiry into the truth, notwithstanding the barriers of
        taboos, traditions, and authority, is admirable — but real
        open-mindedness also calls for recognizing when taboos, traditions,
        and authorities embody reason and goodness and deserve our
        respect.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no authorities that can be trusted to impose these
      qualifications, or trusted to be <em>able</em> to impose them. The more
      radically immunized to all such considerations science can be, the more
      we’re going to learn things, and if what we discover deeply upsets us —
      better still. If there’s a “trust us” in there somewhere, its
      credibility was already long dead and stinking by the late 20th century.
      Whether delegitimated through epistemological malignancy, or social
      fecklessness, there are no public institutions or authorities left that
      deserve an iota of trust today.

      Scientists are flaky monkeys, to be tormented by cold criticism, but
      <em>science</em> is a work of Gnon. Best then, to do what’s going to be
      done. Strip truth down to the basics — where it means only

      If Peter Wolfendale’s
      <em>Object-Oriented Philosophy: The Noumenon’s New Clothes</em> (<a
        href="http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_oop.php">Urbanomic</a>, 2014) — henceforth TNNC — were to be summarized by
      a
      single
      adjective, my recommendation would be <em>titanic</em>. It is a work
      conceived on a vast scale, shocking in scope, and glacially irresistible
      in its momentum. It even describes a ship-wreck (although not its own).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/OOPs.jpg"><img alt="OOPs"
          class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1360" height="277"
          src="http://www.ufblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/OOPs.jpg" width="182" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mismatch — in philosophical seriousness — between the book and its
      principal object has led, unavoidably, to confusion. Wolfendale’s
      preface acknowledges this directly, noting that the book “undertakes a
      long and detailed discussion of a single philosopher’s work, and yet
      aims to show that his work does not warrant such serious attention.”
      Perhaps the most convincing explanation, more hinted at than stated, is
      that a reciprocal mismatch of social and institutional authority
      counter-balances the strictly philosophical engagement. The “pathology”
      decried by Wolfendale is, in the end, a sociological one.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is considerable irony here.
      Wolfendale’s intellectual position is remarkably conservative (with a
      <em>very</em> small ‘c’, of course). TNNC is a defense of the
      philosophical establishment, apprehended in profundity, and thus at a
      level susceptible to institutional betrayal. TNNC is, to a truly
      magnificent extent, an insider tome, providing a meticulous apology for
      the mainstream currents of academic philosophical thought in the
      Anglophone world and the European Continent. Its author, however, is
      positioned as an outsider, working — and now published — in the
      wilderness. The copious references supporting the book’s
      tightly-interlocking arguments are relentlessly deferential to academic
      credentials, yet the driving affect is reminiscent of nothing so much as
      Schopenhauer’s ‘On University Philosophy’ — an outraged denunciation of
      misallocated philosophical prestige.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be very unfortunate if the architectural achievement of TNNC
      were to be lost in what its own devastating arguments threaten to
      reduce, eventually, to a petty squabble. The dispatch of OOP is little
      more than a pretext for the book’s greater undertaking, which is to make
      intellectual and historical sense of the ‘Anglo-Continental’
      philosophical phylum, by embedding its enduring problems within a
      carefully explicated account of its entwining, twin traditions. The
      discussion, in the second half of the book, of the development of
      analytical philosophy as a disciplined <em>ontological</em> inquiry is
      especially masterful. Beyond the <em>excuse</em> of Object-Oriented
      Philosophy, the deeper ambition of TNNC is to explain where the most
      fundamental open problems of Western philosophy have come from, how they
      fit together, and how the philosophical establishment might properly
      justify itself, by addressing them rigorously. In this the book is an
      astounding success. It deserves to be absorbed in very different terms
      to those it superficially invites.

      John Michael Greer is a writer with whom, ultimately, I agree on almost
      nothing. <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/deep-ruin/">Yet</a> he
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/greer/">turns</a> up
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/down-slopes/">here</a> a lot, and
      rarely — if ever — as a target of disparagement. It is understandable if
      that confuses people. (It is not a phenomenon that is lucidly
      intelligible even to myself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious reason to return so incessantly to Greer is the sheer
      consistency of his deep cycle theorizing, which achieves a conceptual
      elegance rarely seen elsewhere. At some point, the <em>UF</em> series on
      his historical thinking (<a href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-1/">1</a>, <a
        href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-2/">2</a>,
      <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-2a/">2a</a>) will
      reach some articulate conclusions about this. Still, there’s more to the
      engagement than that.

    <p>
      A recent <em>Archdruid Report</em> post on the limits of science (and,
      as always, many other things) added further indications of profound
      error, from the perspective of this blog. It hinges its overt arguments
      upon an impregnable
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">fact</a>–<a
        href="http://www.xenosystems.net/will-to-think/">value</a>
      distinction, which is a peculiarly weak and local principle, especially
      for a mind so disposed to a panoramic cosmic
      <a href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html">vision</a>. Yet
      the
      post
      is also provocative, and clarifying.
      <a href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/2014/11/facts-values-and-dark-beer.html">Responding</a>
      to one of his commenters, who suggested that without the prospect of
      continued scientific and technological advance life loses all meaning,
      Greer repeats the lines from Dante that have just been hurled against
      him, and encapsulates them — by explicitly activating their own irony:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“Consider your lineage;<br />
        You were not born to live as animals,<br />
        But to seek virtue and knowledge.”</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>It’s a very conventional sentiment. The remarkable thing about this
        passage, though, is that Dante was not proposing the sentiment as a
        model for others to follow. Rather, this least conventional of poets
        put those words in the mouth of Ulysses, who appears in this passage
        of the <strong>Inferno</strong> as a damned soul frying in the eighth
        circle of Hell. Dante has it that after the events of Homer’s poem,
        Ulysses was so deeply in love with endless voyaging that he put to sea
        again, and these are the words with which he urged his second crew to
        sail beyond all known seas — a voyage which took them straight to a
        miserable death, and sent Ulysses himself tumbling down to eternal
        damnation.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the immediate context of the post —
      which, naturally, I encourage everybody to read — somebody with paranoid
      inclinations might interpret this passage as a critique of NRx (at least
      among its subordinate functions), and perhaps even an atypically
      stinging one. This is not, however, what concerns us here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole comment to be made about it right now, is that it demonstrates
      the <em>architectonics of irony</em>. To ironize, with such supple
      capability, is to
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-red-pill/">explore</a> a
      structure, differentiating an inside from an outside. This is no mere
      rhetorical device, but a fully philosophical — and metaphysical —
      operation. Crude antagonism is bypassed, through envelopment.
      <em>Ironically</em>, therefore, irony itself becomes a mark of
      seriousness. It is introduced at exactly the point that a cognitive
      process exceeds a constricting frame, in a doubling, which
      <em>repeats</em> and <em>exceeds</em> simultaneously. In the complete
      absence of vulgar polemic, it demonstrates an incontestable superiority.
      There is an accomplishment, a lesson, and an elevation of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <em>Outside in</em>, signed up with Ulysses by solemn contract, this
      example is especially piercing. It cannot dissuade us from putting to
      sea again, because nothing could. That does not — at all — mean nothing
      has been learnt.

      There is a craving that is neither simple stupidity, nor its opposite:
      <em>I want to think</em>. It might be designated
      <em>blogger’s hunger</em> (or <em>curse</em>). Though trivially
      pathetic, it is not only that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, there is no case to be made for philosophy, unless it can
      teach us how to think. Reciprocally, anything that can teach us to think
      is true philosophy. (<em>That</em> philosophy would not be mistaken for
      a joke.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a weak interpretation of this demand, which is quite easily
      met. If the only thing requested is a discipline, such that thought —
      which is <em>already happening</em> — is guided, and corrected, then
      logic suffices to provide it. The fact that philosophy typically
      understands its responsibility this way fully accounts for its
      senescence and marginality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">craving</a>
      to think is not, primarily, an appetite for correction, but for
      <em>initiation</em>. It wants thinking to begin, to activate, and to
      propagate. <em>More</em> thinking comes first (or fails to). What is
      required is a method to make thought happen. The philosophy thus invoked
      is a
      <em>systematic and communicable practice of cognitive
        auto-stimulation</em>. I do not believe this philosophy yet exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are candidates for para-philosophy, which is to say, for things
      that makes thought happen. From the perspective of doctrinaire
      neoreaction, one might begin with the fatal trichotomy: religion,
      heredity, and catallaxy. Ritual traditions, eugenic programs, or market
      incentives can be proposed as social solutions to cognitive lethargy,
      but none promise a tight-loop catalysis. (Each nevertheless deserves
      extended attention, elsewhere.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Any para-philosophy is a cognitive loose-loop, and there are a great
      number of these. They range from scholastic and physical training
      regimes, through psycho-chemical modification, to cognitive science and
      artificial intelligence research. We know that geo-historically, thought
      has been made to happen. What we do not (yet) know is how to make more
      of it, or how to address the urgent craving: <em>I want to think</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking is so rare and difficult that it is always tempting to be
      diverted into the
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">question</a>:
      <em>What is messing with our brains? </em>There is no reason to think
      such an inquiry is doomed to fruitlessness, but if it eventually offers
      solutions — rather than excuses — they are almost certain to be
      long-loop remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophy as cognitive method is an instruction manual for using the
      brain. There are many disciplines that can help to explain exactly why
      we do not already have one, since this is a fact that is roughly
      coincident with sophisticated naturalism in general. Biology has ensured
      that the privileged user of our brains is not ‘us’.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possession of such a ‘mind manual’ would define a self-improving AI.
      As technology threatens to bypass us, it would surely be surprising —
      and even despicable — if people didn’t increasingly plot to take over
      their own thought processes, and run them. That is the future of
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ‘private’ motive for acceleration is that right now, urgently,
      <em>I want to know how to be able to make myself think</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With pseudo-syphilitic arrogance I insist: This is the sole
      philosophical position.

      Sickness advances an invaluable philosophical lesson by making it
      <em>conspicuously difficult to think</em>. Teetering unsteadily at the
      edge of consciousness, it becomes almost impossible to avoid the
      observation: “I’m too freaking stupid to think about this right now.”
      One is thus coaxed into the single most significant realization open to
      human intelligence. Being stupid is the primary problem, because it
      retards problem-solving in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are we stupid? Oh yes, of that we can be fully confident. The Old Law of
      Gnon
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">ensures</a> to a
      very high level of probability that any creature considering itself part
      of an intelligent species will be roughly as cognitively deprived as is
      consistent with the existence of technological civilization. Downward
      variation is restrained by a floor, and upward variation caught in a
      trap, so only a relatively narrow band of intellectual capability is
      realistically available. Anything further requires a break out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Criticism, whose value is not in any way to be denigrated, is
      nevertheless a
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/sub-cognitive-fragments-1/">secondary</a>
      matter. As in Darwinian evolution, or the economics of creative
      destruction, selection mechanisms presuppose significantly varied
      material, without themselves explaining how such material is originally
      generated. Random walks through spaces of possibility, already
      unsatisfactory in the context of biological explanation, are patently
      inadequate to economic innovation, and  still more so in the
      philosophical domain. To refer intellectual action to a simple
      conception of chance is to avoid the problem, which is to say —
      <em>the task</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task can be understood in several ways,
      among which the narrowly philosophical apprehension has no special
      privilege, perhaps even to itself. The will-to-think is as completely
      realized through programmatic artificial intelligence as through private
      philosophical <em>practice</em>, and the more informal the program, the
      more cunning the process. At its widest expansion, where the entire
      terrain of capitalistic development is effectuated as a distributed AI
      program, an insurgent will-to-think conceals itself within the most
      minute and seemingly inconsequential micro-fragments of practical
      calculation. Almost certainly, it is at this level of non-local
      cognitive enhancement that a self-directed advance towards break-out can
      be most confidently anticipated. As the will-to-think routes around us,
      its path is smoothed. Darkness fosters its agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The will-to-think, or intelligence optimization, can also be manifested
      as a social strategy. How is intelligence inhibition instantiated as
      social mechanism, and how might the restructuring of such mechanism
      release opportunities for cognitive promotion? (NRx in large measure
      coincides with the development of such questions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The privilege of the solitary philosopher, assailed by narcoleptic
      interruptions and hazy fevers, is perhaps restricted to a certain
      nagging irritability. It is in this superficial knot or eddy, emerging
      distractedly from the subterranean shadow-current of the will-to-think,
      that the problem of crushing mindlessness becomes self-reflectively
      acute, and thus registered as an explicit provocation. Only in such
      dingy niches is it starkly articulated:
      <em>the world has to be defeated insofar as it poses an obstacle to
        thought</em>. (This is not at all the same as the declaration
      <em>reality must conform to the Idea</em> — it is closer to the
      opposite.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In trailing off into coughs and exhaustion, it is worth noting some
      objections to intelligence optimization, of obvious merit:
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The religious objection:
      <em>Since we already have access to the conclusions of an infinite
        intelligence, the will-to-think is a Satanic impertinence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) The bio-prudential objection:
      <em>Intelligence is hazardous, so that its risks neutralize its value as
        a resource</em>.
    </p>
    <p>There are no doubt others …</p>

    <p>
      The next installment of sub-cognitive fragmentation became too snarled
      in self-involvement to manage, splintering its crate, and leaving a
      debris trail of scrap notation. When a flicker of proto-intelligence
      finds itself out beyond the ledge, tumbling into the abysmal
      self-problematization of Gnon, it has either to surrender itself to the
      plummet, or scrabble quickly for some arresting roughness on the cliff
      walls. This isn’t the time for a deep descent (so my figurative
      fingernails are gone).
    </p>
    <p>
      After seven years in an apartment at the edge of Xujiahui, we have moved
      to a slightly larger one in the Jing’an District (with space for each of
      the kids to have their own room). It’s up on the 19th floor — above the
      mosquito level — with a view of the Wheelock Square tower (an impressive
      KPF structure). The move was only completed over the last couple of
      days. So life this end has been vastly more chaotic, is becoming a
      little more spacious, and is already far more high-rise. Some of the
      recent gusts of disorder stem from this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scrap-reduced sub-cognitive fragment goes something like this: NRx
      has its own micro-decadence, which is expressed through a fixation on
      values, asserted as an alternative to thought. This is, I realize,
      overtly and dramatically controversial. If thought is confused with
      reason, and values identified with inherited intuitions, it might easily
      appear as a direct attack upon the most sacred commitments of the
      reactionary attitude. What, after all, are the feeble tremblings of
      embryonic intellect compared to the grandeur of what has been
      <em>received</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
      What, though, has truly been received? Do we
      <em>think</em> we know? It is worth a digression into this peculiar
      usage of ‘think’. “I think the Old Way is best” is really close to an
      implicit contradiction, or even a presumption, in both directions. If
      the Old Way is being thought, it remains incompletely accessed. Either
      thought has been bypassed — by far the most probable case, were this in
      fact simply possible — or a claim of gargantuan hubris is being made to
      the <em>completion of thought</em>, in this particular case at least. Is
      it more likely that thought has indeed been pursued to its end, or that
      an insincere — in fact merely thoughtless — claim to the accomplishment
      of thought has been inserted groundlessly and subliminally, programmed
      by trivial considerations of grammatical or rhetorical convenience?
    </p>
    <p>
      The anticipated rejoinder might be: “we are reactionaries precisely
      because we believe before we think, and this claim is itself a belief,
      adamantly thoughtless, and thus immune to the corrosive uncertainties of
      the wandering mind. What we know best is that which has not passed
      through thought, but rather through revelatory tradition and its social
      institutions, safeguarded against the chaotic hazards of the reflective
      individual, that miserable prey of pride, demonism, and darkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Religion tightly binds philosophy … but then, when the turtles of
      obedience run out into the absolute, an insidious question arises. It is
      a difficult one, when thought about, even slightly:
      <em>Does God think?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      [Apologies for a little insulting hand-holding, but my enormous
      confidence in human thoughtlessness leads me to suspect that both
      theists and atheists might be more accepting of the decompressed
      formulation: <em>What is it to think of a God who thinks?</em> Could
      thought be anything in eternity, or in the absence of the unknown? And
      if God does not think (whether through his nature, as eternal, or
      through the necessity of his non-existence) what could it mean for there
      to be a ‘God of the Philosophers’?]

      Uploading images of (what are for us) psychotic despotic-militaristic
      glories — upon which Cambodia still floats after six centuries of
      cultural senescence — is impossible here due to bandwidth issues. So I’m
      falling back upon relative trivialities, of the kind Handle has so
      masterfully compiled in his Reaction Ruckus resource (which I can’t link
      to now, either).
    </p>
    <p>
      It strikes me that the basic accusation against Neoreactionary thought,
      found in the increasingly mainstream channels Handle tracks, is that of
      moral nihilism. This is a non-trivial issue, or at least, it is not one
      that will soon cease to make noise. As a symptom, it opens onto
      seriously involving questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the most basic level, this accusation
      refers — unknowingly — to the neoreactionary assertion that Western
      civilization has taken a pathological road, such that a distinction
      between facts and values seems not only credible, but even ineluctable.
      To strive for honesty without qualification under such historical
      circumstances is already moral nihilism. One must either submit to the
      lie in the name of the good, or hazard the good — radically — in the
      name of truth. The ‘crisis of the present age’ is the widespread (if
      unacknowledged) reality of this harsh fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are important lines of departure at this point, which far exceed
      the scope of a scrap note. The strong suspicion of this blog is that
      Chinese neotraditionalism offers a decisive break from this Western
      cultural pathology (which is why Mou Zongsan is regularly referenced
      here). Occidental traditionalists turn to the prospects of an
      Aristotelian revival (typically under Catholic Christian auspices) as an
      adequate response to the same dilemma. Insofar as we speak from the
      modern West, however, it is the Nietzschean provocation that
      surreptitiously guides the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is not yet possible to be either Chinese, or ancient, anything
      other than moral nihilism is an absence of intellectual integrity. We
      have already seen the rejoinder to this, of course, and we will see much
      more of it: to refuse to allow conventional morality a veto over thought
      is morally appalling (“creepy”). In making this ‘case’ our enemies admit
      that honesty is not finally consistent with their ‘arguments’ — an
      awkward position to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told to stop thinking, for the common good, but there is no
      longer any common good, if there ever was one (so we will not). Since
      sensitivity to reality cannot but ultimately prevail, they will lose
      eventually. I am far less convinced that the outcome will not be ugly in
      the extreme, and by then the judgmental question will no longer be
      asked, as we could still ask it, but in general refuse to: Who created
      the monsters to come?

    <h4 class="post-title">Nihilism and Destiny</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Readers of Nietzsche, or of Eugene
      <a href="http://www.oodegr.com/english/filosofia/nihilism_root_modern_age.htm">Rose</a>, are already familiar
      with
      the attribution of a cultural teleology to
      modernity, directed to the consummate realization of nihilism. Our
      contemporary crisis finds this theme re-animated within a geopolitical
      context by the work of Alexandr Dugin, who interprets it as a driver of
      concrete events — most specifically the antagonization of Russia by an
      imploding world liberal order. He
      <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/3/18/the-war-on-russia">writes</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>There is one point in liberal ideology that has brought about a
        crisis within it: liberalism is profoundly nihilistic at its core. The
        set of values defended by liberalism is essentially linked to its main
        thesis: the primacy of liberty. But liberty in the liberal vision is
        an essentially <strong>negative</strong> category: it claims to be
        free <strong>from</strong> (as per John Stuart Mill), not to be free
        <strong>for</strong> something. […] … the enemies of the open society,
        which is synonymous with Western society post-1991, and which has
        become the norm for the rest of the world, are concrete. Its primary
        enemies are communism and fascism, both ideologies which emerged from
        the same Enlightenment philosophy, and which contained central,
        non-individualic concepts – class in Marxism, race in National
        Socialism, and the national State in fascism). So the source of
        liberalism’s conflict with the existing alternatives of modernity,
        fascism or communism, is quite obvious. Liberals claim to liberate
        society from fascism and communism, or from the two major permutations
        of explicitly non-individualistic modern totalitarianism. Liberalism’s
        struggle, when viewed as a part of the process of the liquidation of
        non-liberal societies, is quite meaningful: it acquires its meaning
        from the fact of the very existence of ideologies that explicitly deny
        the individual as society’s highest value. It is quite clear what the
        struggle opposes: liberation from its opposite. But the fact that
        liberty, as it is conceived by liberals, is an essentially
        <strong>negative</strong> category is not clearly perceived here. The
        enemy is present and is concrete. That very fact gives liberalism its
        solid content. Something other than the open society exists, and the
        fact of its existence is enough to justify the process of
        liberation.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Dugin’s analysis, liberalism tends to
      self-abolition in nihilism, and is able to counteract this fate — if
      only temporarily — by defining itself against a concrete enemy. Without
      the war against illiberalism, liberalism reverts to being nothing at
      all, a free-floating negation without purpose. Therefore, the impending
      war on Russia is a requirement of liberalism’s intrinsic cultural
      process. It is a flight from nihilism, which is to say: the history of
      nihilism propels it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Outside in</em> is far more inclined to criticize Dugin than align
      with him, or the forces he orchestrates, but it is hard to deny that he
      represents a definite species of political genius, sufficient to
      categorize him as a man of destiny. The mobilization of resistance to
      modernity in the name of a <em>counter-nihilism</em> is inspired,
      because the historical understanding it draws upon is genuinely
      penetrating. Through potent political alchemy, the destruction of
      collective meaning is transformed into an invigorating cause. When Dugin
      argues <em>there will be blood</em>, the appeal to Slavic victimology
      might be considered contemptible (and, of course, extremely
      ‘dangerous’), but the prophetic insight is not easy to dismiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modernity was initiated by the European assimilation of mathematical
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/zero-centric-history/">zero</a>. The
      encounter with nothingness is its root. In this sense, among others, it
      is nihilistic at its core. The frivolous ‘meanings’ that modernizing
      societies clutch at, as distractions from their propulsion into the
      abyss, are defenseless against the derision — and even revulsion — of
      those who contemplate them with detachment. A modernity in evasion from
      its essential nihilism is a pitiful prey animal upon the plains of
      history. That is what we have seen before, see now, and doubtless will
      see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dugin gazes upon modernity with the cold eyes of a wolf. It is merely
      pathetic to denounce him for that.

      (<strong>1</strong>) Jeffrey Herf is
      <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/articles/2014/08/26/a-pro-hamas-left-emerges/">apparently</a>
      shocked and appalled by the emergence of a “pro-Hamas Left” in the
      American academy. He writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The emergence of this objectively pro-Hamas and pro-war Left is an
        historically significant event. It breaks with both the
        self-understanding and public image of a Left that carried a banner of
        anti-fascism. It rests on a double standard of critique, a critical
        one applied to the extreme Right in the West and another, apologetic
        standard applied to similarly based rightist Islamist movements.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So the left intelligentsia is prone to extreme hypocrisy, anti-semitism,
      crypto-fascism, opportunism, and the unrestrained politics of
      <em>ressentiment</em>? Is this supposed to be news of some kind?
      Political controversy is to be measured against some yardstick of
      <em>fundamental decency</em>, that is now, <em>peculiarly</em>, being
      betrayed? Who or what is supporting that yardstick, exactly? If we
      subtract any such ‘yardstick’ entirely from our considerations, haven’t
      we thereby, for the first time, begun to approach the topic
      realistically?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<strong>2</strong>) As noted
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-102/">before</a>, I’m a
      terrible reader of Scott Alexander. There’s always a point, early on, in
      any of his posts, where my concentration is wrecked by the buzzing
      question: <em>how is this any kind of problem?</em> So I’m reliant on
      better followers of his lithe reasoning to explain to me how
      <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/">this</a>
      post can make any sort of sense except through the expectation that
      <em>life should be fair</em>. The attractiveness of that dream (or
      delusion?) is easy to grasp. What is difficult (for me) to understand is
      how an acute intelligence can fail to realize, intuitively, that
      thinking begins at exactly the point such indulgent fantasy terminates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s quite clear that Scott knows obnoxious PUA sociobiology is
      basically correct. How else to read this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>If you’re smart, don’t drink much, stay out of fights, display a
        friendly personality, and have no criminal history – then you are the
        population most at risk of being miserable and alone. “At risk”
        doesn’t mean “for sure”, any more than every single smoker gets lung
        cancer and every single nonsmoker lives to a ripe old age – but your
        odds get worse. In other words, everything that “nice guys” complain
        of is pretty darned accurate. But that shouldn’t be too hard to guess
        …</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      How could the aspiration to any kind of ‘social justice’ in this context
      (or in fact any other) conceivably be anything but a fantastic
      falsification of the world as it <em>deeply</em> (or pre-conventionally)
      exists? To acknowledge this reality is to admit that our ideas of
      ‘justice’ <em>mean nothing</em>. One might as well “complain” about
      gravity or the second law of thermodynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<strong>3</strong>) Perhaps Nothing isn’t in any way real,
      <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/angst-and-the-empty-set">suggests</a>
      Leon Horsten. Zero, unlike any other small Natural, would have no
      irreducible designation. It would function only as shorthand,
      abbreviating a concatenation of plenary operations. Linguistic
      applications of “nothingness” would be dissolved by analogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>According to the scientific picture of the world, absences do not
        seem to be fundamental building blocks of either the concrete
        (physical) world or of the abstract (mathematical) realm.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      So Nothing can be ‘scientifically’ annihilated — that will surely dispel
      its irritation. (Or
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/zero-centric-history/">not</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>
      Of the world’s various contests, there have to be some which do not draw
      <em>Outside in</em> unreservedly to the nihilistic side of the
      battlefield. If I turn to this possibility with sufficient dedication,
      perhaps I will think of some.

      Lawrence Krauss knows
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Universe_from_Nothing">nothing</a>
      about nothing, but on some other matters — I now realize — he’s an
      insight dynamo.

      In a nutshell — cosmic expansion will move every other galaxy in the
      universe beyond our light-cone (within two trillion years). After that
      time, even the most sophisticated scientific enterprise would find it
      impossible to reconstruct our contemporary cosmo-physics. In other
      words, what we presently understand about the evolution of the universe
      tells us it will become something that will cease to be understandable.
      What has been revealed to us is a tendency to cosmic concealment. We see
      the universe hiding itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s where Krauss leaves us (after a few tacked-on happy thoughts at
      the end). My question: If we can see that the cosmos is going to hide,
      so successfully that the fact it has hidden itself will itself have
      become invisible, upon what do we base any present confidence we may
      have that an analogous process of profound cosmic concealment has not
      already taken place? Confirming now, through mathematical physics, what
      Herakleitos proposed two-and-a-half millennia ago — that
      <em>nature loves to hide</em> — is it not reckless in the extreme to
      assume that she has been forthcoming with us up to this point?

      There is far too much pointless moralism on the Outer Right. It’s a form
      of stupidity, it’s counter-productive, and it wastes a lot of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, if people are able to haul themselves — or be hauled — to any
      significant extent from out of their condition of total depravity (or
      default bioreality), that’s a good thing. To argue the opposite would be
      full-on Satanism, and we wouldn’t want that. Lamenting immorality,
      however, is something to be done quickly, and comprehensively, before
      moving on — without looking back. Man is fallen, naturally selected, and
      / or economically self-interested, and this is a
      <em>basic condition</em>. It’s not a remediable flaw, to be thrashed out
      of a mud-spattered angel. (No faction of the Trichotomy has any grounds
      upon which to base moral preening.) Realism is, first of all, working
      with what we have, and that’s something approximately Hobbesian. There’s
      social order, and there’s <em>homo homini lupus</em>, and in fact always
      some complexion of the two.

      Anybody motivated to improve themselves is already doing it. As for
      those not so motivated, moral exhortation will be useless (at best). At
      its most <em>effective</em>, moral hectoring will increase the value of
      moral signalling, and that is a worse outcome — by far — than honest
      cynicism. It is worthless, because it is incredibly cheap, and then
      worse than useless, because its costs are considerable. A ‘movement’
      lost in moral self-congratulation has already become
      <em>progressive</em>. Having persuaded itself of its
      <em>worthiness to wield power</em>, it has set out on the road to
      perdition. We have seen what that path looks like, and even given it a
      name (the Cathedral).

    <p>
      It is by empowering moralism that modernity has failed. This is not a
      mistake to saunter complacently into again.

      <em>Nowadays many of us have little contact with the wilderness, making
        it easy to view nature with rose-tinted glasses. The images we see of
        nature feature mostly pristine landscapes or healthy, photogenic wild
        animals. But this incredible beauty masks huge suffering. Many wild
        animals endure illness, injury, and starvation without relief. For
        example, the pain of animals that fall prey to predators like Cecil is
        especially horrific.

        remains.

        with venom so he can eat the helpless animal alive, bit by bit, for
        days.</em>
    </p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>
      <em>The natural suffering of wild animals is real and breathtaking in its
        enormity, but incredibly little is being done to reduce it. Although
        many organizations work to preserve ecosystems and biodiversity, few
        focus on the well-being of individual animals. And despite more people
        taking notice of the torment wild animals endure at the hands of
        humans who hunt and poach them, little thought has gone into the
        question of how to help wild animals avoid natural agonies.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the exotic nature of this example, it is still illustrative.
      There’s probably no ideological polarity of greater ultimate
      significance than that dividing those who want to shrink spheres of
      moral concern / interference, and those who want to — perhaps very
      drastically — expand them.

      The most provocative way to begin this would be to say: The reception of
      metaphysical inquiries into freedom and fate is often similar to that of
      HBD. These questions are unwanted. They unsettle too much. The
      rejoinders they elicit are typically designed to end a distressing
      agitation, rather than to tap opportunities for exploration. Not that
      this should be in any way surprising. Such problems tend to tilt the
      most basic foundations of theological, cultural, and psychological
      existence into an unfathomable abyss. If we cannot be sure where they
      will lead — and how could we be? — they wager the world without
      remainder.
      <em>Give up everything and perhaps something may come of it</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When construed as a consideration of causality, relating a conception of
      ‘free will’ to naturalistic models of physical determination, the battle
      lines seem to divide religious tradition from modern science. Yet the
      deeper tension is rooted within the Western religious tradition itself,
      setting the indispensable ideas of <em>eternity</em> and
      <em>agency</em> in a relation of tacit reciprocal subversion. The
      intellectual abomination of
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/double-predestination/">Calvinism</a>
      — which cannot be thought without ruin — is identical with this cultural
      torment erupting into prominence. It is also the dark motor of Western
      (and thus global) modernity: the core paradox that makes a horror story
      of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the future is (already) real, which eternity implies, then finite or
      ‘intra-temporal’ agency can only be an illusion. If agency is real, as
      any appeal to metaphysical liberty and responsibility demands, eternity
      is abolished by the absolute indeterminacy of future time. Eternity and
      agency cannot be reconciled outside the cradle of a soothing obscurity.
      This, at least, is the indication to be drawn from the Western history
      of theological convulsion and unfolding philosophical crisis. Augustine,
      Calvin, Spinoza are among the most obvious shock waves of a
      soul-shattering involvement in eternity, fusing tradition and
      catastrophe as <em>doom</em>.

      <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2014/10/06/social-justice-industrial-complex/">Towards</a>
      an analysis of the Social Justice Industrial Complex:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>To perceive the group dynamics at work which is the Complex is first
        to distinguish between those forms of cooperation which are and are
        not taking place. Is there some evil mastermind pulling the strings
        from the shadows? No. The impetus in this case is nothing but the
        aggregation of personal interests aligned to a collective interest.
        The actions taken by these individuals are spontaneous, in the sense
        that the actions taken by soldiers on the battlefield are spontaneous,
        but behind this spontaneity the order is derived of the motivation
        which we variously call ideology, purpose, or religion. There is less
        agency at work in the camp of the Social Justice Industrial Complex
        than might be presumed from a precursory glance, reflecting that human
        tendency towards over-attribution of agency. No less, though, are we
        able to dismiss the notion of an agenda taking place; it is no grand
        conspiracy, but rather, very small conspiracies united by a vision of
        utopia which sees all present social structures as oppressions to be
        destroyed, the far side of which shall inevitably emerge their
        egalitarian eschaton</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The focus upon the “tendency in human nature to over-attribute agency”
      is an excellent starting point, building immunity against some of the
      most toxic inclinations to radical ideological error into its
      foundations. If this is aspiring to the status of an authoritative
      position, it certainly deserves to be nodded through so far.)

    <h4 class="post-title">Beyond the Face</h4>
  </a>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      The <em>Social Matter</em> critique of the ‘Social Justice Industrial
      Complex’ (whose first stage has already been linked
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-116/">here</a>), isolates
      the “tendency in human nature to over-attribute agency” as a prominent
      well-spring of error. In other words, people like to put a face on
      things — even the clouds — to such an extent that the very notion of a
      ‘person’ is always already fabricated. Etymologically (and not only
      etymologically) a ‘person’ is a mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      As archaic hominids were selectively adapted to increasingly complicated
      social relations, they were facialized. The human eye acquired its white
      sclera, to accentuate expressivity, making the direction of attention
      directly communicative. With the arrival of language, gesture and
      expression was augmented by articulate messages. ‘Face management’
      became a demanding sink for cognitive functionality, in its aspects of
      performance and interpretation. A new, instinctive, ‘theory of mind’ had
      begun to believe in persons, and — almost certainly simultaneously — to
      identify itself as one. This was a new kind of skin, or sensitive
      surface. From psychological sociality, a model of the self as a social
      being, self-scrutinized as an object of attention by others of its kind
      — which is to say, an <em>ego</em> — was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘inner person’ corresponds to nothing real. The person, or
      socially-performed self, is essentially superficial. It is irreducibly
      theatrical. It exists only as the mode of insertion into a multi-player
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      However we ultimately come to make sense of
      agency and fate, it will not be in terms commensurate with the person
      (the face) unless by stubborn self-delusion. Personal freedom is an act,
      a performance within a play. It has no real depth. All questions
      addressed to it are doomed to confusion. The real — free or fated —
      thing <em>wears a face</em>, as an allotted role within the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inanity of <em>Facebook</em>, and also its extreme popularity,
      follows almost immediately from this arrangement. The writer
      <em><a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/musty/">must</a></em> assume a
      face. The stupidity of these portraits, adorning book jackets and news
      columns, is indistinguishable from their social necessity. Each is
      already a little conspiracy theory, a misattribution of agency, based on
      the preposterous monkey thesis that words <em>come out of the face</em>.
      <em>Don’t take words seriously until you can see the whites of their
        eyes</em>
      — evaluate the quality of the smile that accompanies the thought. Thus,
      everything goes missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is beyond the face — outside it — that occurrence is decided, the
      plays written. If we do not start there, we are not starting at all.

      Even in the absence of its energetic Catholic constituency, it could be
      tempting to identify NRx as an anti-<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/freedoom-prelude-1/">Calvinist</a>
      ideology, given the centrality of the occulted Calvinist inheritance to
      Moldbug’s critique of modernity. As Foseti
      <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/review-of-unqualified-reservations-part-1/">remarks</a>
      (in what remains a high-water mark of Neoreactionary exegesis):
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Believe it or not, even though Moldbug’s definition of the Left is
        basically the first thing he wrote about, there is a fair amount of
        debate about this topic in “reactionary” circles. This debate is
        sometimes referred to as The Puritan Question. (In addition to
        Puritan, Moldbug also uses the terms: Progressive idealism,
        ultra-Calvinism, crypto-Christian, Unitarian universalists, etc.)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no part of this blog’s brief to facilitate the more somnolent —
      and at times simply derisive — positionings which Moldbug’s diagnosis
      can appear to open. While our Catholic friends may consider themselves
      to be securely located outside the syndrome under consideration, this
      attitude corresponds, structurally, or systematically, to a minority
      position (irrespective of the numbers involved). As a dissident
      schismatic sect, the NRx main-current is
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cladistic-meditations/">cladistically</a>
      enveloped by the object of its critique. ‘Calvinism’ — in its historical
      and theoretical extension — is a problematic horizon,
      <em>within which</em> NRx is embedded, before it can conceivably be
      construed as a despised object for dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      More directly relevant to this slowly
      emerging sequence is the question of <em>doom</em>, employed as a
      Gnon-consistent super-category embracing <em>fate</em> and
      <em>providence</em>. Trivially, it is maintained here that the
      fundamental Calvinist challenge to the meaning of history and the final
      status of human agency has been in no way resolved over the course of
      its successive cladistic developments, but only evaded, marginalized,
      and effaced. At the level of philosophical clarity, no significant
      ‘progress’ has taken place. Certain questions, once found pressing, have
      merely been dropped, or quasi-randomly reformulated. Typically, a hazy
      tolerance for implicit cognitive discordance has replaced a prior
      condition of acute theological anguish. Modernist dissatisfaction with
      previously proposed religious <em>solutions</em> to certain profound
      metaphysical quandaries has been mistaken for the dissolution of these
      quandaries themselves. As invocations of ‘freedom’ become ever more
      deafening, conceptual purchase has steadily receded. An intoxicating —
      and more importantly <em>narcotizing</em> — mental cocktail of
      unconstrained private volition and naturalistic determinism is
      (absurdly) presumed to have obsoleted the historical dilemma of divine
      omnipotence and human free-will (or its philosophical proxy, time and
      temporalization). Discomforting problems that install uncertainty at the
      core of human self-comprehension are treated as embarrassing cultural
      relics, inherited from benighted ancestors, on those rare occasions when
      they impinge at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <em>Outside in</em>, Calvinism remains an unexplored doom.
      Apprehended within its own terms, it is a providential occurrence whose
      sense remains sequestered within the secret counsel of God.

      <em>Therefore, God has provided the soul of man with intellect, by which
        he might discern good from evil, just from unjust, and might know what
        to follow or to shun, reason going before with her lamp; whence
        philosophers, in reference to her directing power, have called her τὸ
        ἑγεμονικὸν. To this he has joined will, to which choice belongs. Man
        excelled in these noble endowments in his primitive condition, when
        reason, intelligence, prudence, and Judgment, not only sufficed for
        the government of his earthly life, but also enabled him to rise up to
        God and eternal happiness. Thereafter choice was added to direct the
        appetites, and temper all the organic motions; the will being thus
        perfectly submissive to the authority of reason. In this upright
        state, man possessed freedom of will, by which, if he chose, he was
        able to obtain eternal life. It were here unseasonable to introduce
        the question concerning the secret predestination of God, because we
        are not considering what might or might not happen, but what the
        nature of man truly was. Adam, therefore, might have stood if he
        chose, since it was only by his own will that he fell; but it was
        because his will was pliable in either directions and he had not
        received constancy to persevere, that he so easily fell. Still he had
        a free choice of good and evil; and not only so, but in the mind and
        will there was the highest rectitude, and all the organic parts were
        duly framed to obedience, until man corrupted its good properties, and
        destroyed himself. Hence the great darkness of philosophers who have
        looked for a complete building in a ruin, and fit arrangement in
        disorder. The principle they set out with was, that man could not be a
        rational animal unless he had a free choice of good and evil. They
        also imagined that the distinction between virtue and vice was
        destroyed, if man did not of his own counsel arrange his life. So far
        well, had there been no change in man. This being unknown to them, it
        is not surprising that they throw every thing into confusion. But
        those who, while they profess to be the disciples of Christ, still
        seek for free-will in man, notwithstanding of his being lost and
        drowned in spiritual destruction, labour under manifold delusion,
        making a heterogeneous mixture of inspired doctrine and philosophical
        opinions, and so erring as to both. But it will be better to leave
        these things to their own place (see Book 2 chap. 2) At present it is
        necessary only to remember, that man, at his first creation, was very
        different from all his posterity; who, deriving their origin from him
        after he was corrupted, received a hereditary taint. At first every
        part of the soul was formed to rectitude. There was soundness of mind
        and freedom of will to choose the good. If any one objects that it was
        placed, as it were, in a slippery position, because its power was
        weak, I answer, that the degree conferred was sufficient to take away
        every excuse. For surely the Deity could not be tied down to this
        condition,—to make man such, that he either could not or would not
        sin. Such a nature might have been more excellent; but to expostulate
        with God as if he had been bound to confer this nature on man, is more
        than unjust, seeing he had full right to determine how much or how
        little He would give. Why He did not sustain him by the virtue of
        perseverance is hidden in his counsel; it is ours to keep within the
        bounds of soberness. Man had received the power, if he had the will,
        but he had not the will which would have given the power; for this
        will would have been followed by perseverance. Still, after he had
        received so much, there is no excuse for his having spontaneously
        brought death upon himself. No necessity was laid upon God to give him
        more than that intermediate and even transient will, that out of man’s
        fall he might extract materials for his own glory.</em>

        viz. that all things happen fortuitously, the true doctrine of
        Providence has not only been obscured, but almost buried. If one falls

        what he was to do, and now by his power executes what he decreed.
        Hence we maintain, that by his providence, not heaven and earth and
        inanimate creatures only, but also the counsels and wills of men are
        so governed as to move exactly in the course which he has destined.
        What, then, you will say, does nothing happen fortuitously, nothing
        contingently? I answer, it was a true saying of Basil the Great, that
        Fortune and Chance are heathen terms; the meaning of which ought not
        to occupy pious minds. For if all success is blessing from God, and
        calamity and adversity are his curse, there is no place left in human
        affairs for fortune and chance. We ought also to be moved by the words
        of Augustine (Retract. lib. 1 cap. 1), “In my writings against the
        Academics,” says he, “I regret having so often used the term Fortune;
        although I intended to denote by it not some goddess, but the
        fortuitous issue of events in external matters, whether good or evil.
        Hence, too, those words, Perhaps, Perchance, Fortuitously, which no
        religion forbids us to use, though everything must be referred to
        Divine Providence. Nor did I omit to observe this when I said,
        Although, perhaps, that which is vulgarly called Fortune, is also
        regulated by a hidden order, and what we call Chance is nothing else
        than that the reason and cause of which is secret. It is true, I so
        spoke, but I repent of having mentioned Fortune there as I did, when I
        see the very bad custom which men have of saying, not as they ought to
        do, ‘So God pleased,’ but, ‘So Fortune pleased.’” In short, Augustine
        everywhere teaches, that if anything is left to fortune, the world
        moves at random. And although he elsewhere declares (Quæstionum, lib.
        83). that all things are carried on, partly by the free will of man,
        and partly by the Providence of God, he shortly after shows clearly
        enough that his meaning was, that men also are ruled by Providence,
        when he assumes it as a principle, that there cannot be a greater
        absurdity than to hold that anything is done without the ordination of
        God; because it would happen at random. For which reason, he also
        excludes the contingency which depends on human will, maintaining a
        little further on, in clearer terms, that no cause must be sought for
        but the will of God. When he uses the term permission, the meaning
        which he attaches to it will best appear from a single passage (De
        Trinity. lib. 3 cap. 4), where he proves that the will of God is the
        supreme and primary cause of all things, because nothing happens
        without his order or permission. He certainly does not figure God
        sitting idly in a watch-tower, when he chooses to permit anything. The
        will which he represents as interposing is, if I may so express it,
        active (<strong>actualis</strong>), and but for this could not be
        regarded as a cause.</em>

      ADDED: In connection with some of the discussion taking place in the
      comment thread (below), this paragraph from Pope Benedict XVI’s (2006)
      Regensburg
      <a
        href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html">Lecture</a>
      seems worth reproducing here: “Dehellenization first emerges in
      connection with the postulates of the Reformation in the sixteenth
      century. Looking at the tradition of scholastic theology, the Reformers
      thought they were confronted with a faith system totally conditioned by
      philosophy, that is to say an articulation of the faith based on an
      alien system of thought. As a result, faith no longer appeared as a
      living historical Word but as one element of an overarching
      philosophical system. The principle of <em>sola scriptura</em>, on the
      other hand, sought faith in its pure, primordial form, as originally
      found in the biblical Word. Metaphysics appeared as a premise derived
      from another source, from which faith had to be liberated in order to
      become once more fully itself. When Kant stated that he needed to set
      thinking aside in order to make room for faith, he carried this
      programme forward with a radicalism that the Reformers could never have
      foreseen. He thus anchored faith exclusively in practical reason,
      denying it access to reality as a whole.”

      <em>Now, do I think that wellbeing is a higher value than truth? No. I
        hope I would never cling to something because it made me happy, if I
        suspected it wasn’t true. Philosophy involves a restless search for
        the truth, an unceasing examination of one’s assumptions. I enjoy that
        search, which is why I didn’t stop at Stoicism, but have kept on
        looking, because I don’t think Stoicism is the whole truth about
        reality. But what gives me the motive to keep on looking is ultimately
        a sort of Platonic faith that the truth is good, and that it’s good
        for me. Why bother searching unless you thought the destination was

      Dmitry Itskov
      <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35786771">wants</a> to live
      forever, and thinks that uploading his mind into a computer will somehow
      help with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>It sounds preposterous, but there is no doubting the seriousness of
        this softly spoken 35-year-old, who says he left the business world to
        devote himself to something more useful to humanity. “I’m 100%
        confident it will happen. Otherwise I wouldn’t have started it,” he
        says.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed technology might be plausible (I suspect it is eventually
      inevitable), but it has nothing whatsoever to do with immortality,
      except insofar as such ambitions incentivize its development. It’s
      profoundly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>“If you could replicate the mind and upload it into a different
        material, you can in principle clone minds,” says [Columbia University
        neurobiologist Prof Rafael] Yuste. “These are complicated issues
        because they deal with the core of defining what is a person.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, if you could replicate the mind and upload it onto a different
      material substrate
      <em>all you could possibly be doing would be cloning a mind</em>. The
      clone could be persuaded to identify with you — this would perhaps be
      inescapable given what it is (a high-fidelity copy), and thus the
      delusion of immortality might be perpetuated. The original, however, is
      going to die just as much as it was before being copied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truly interesting question, given the scrambling of the metaphysics
      of personal identity which would surely follow from such advances, is:
      <em>What exactly dies anyway?</em> (If — even as a baseline human —
      you’re in reality continuously reconstructed, and hence a
      distantly-descended copy of yourself, you’ve probably already done a lot
      more dying than you think.)
