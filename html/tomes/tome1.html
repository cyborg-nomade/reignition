    <section class="post">
      <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/introducing-urban-future/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Introducing Urban Future</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        What can readers expect from this blog? Since it promises to be
        oriented towards the future, it makes sense to begin with some
        preliminary forecasting about itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most basically and predictably, Urban Future has been programmed by
        its name. Its principal topic is the intersection of cities with the
        future. It aims to foster discussion about cities as engines of the
        future, and about futurism as a dynamic influence on the shape,
        character, and development of cities. More particularly, it scavenges
        for clues, and floats speculations, about the Shanghai of tomorrow. It
        anticipates a global urban future in which Shanghai features
        prominently, and a coming Shanghai that expresses, both starkly and
        subtly, the transformative forces of global futurism. This is to get
        quite far ahead of ourselves, which is where we shall typically be.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some readers, ‘futurism’ will invoke the early 20th century avant
        garde cultural movement crystallized by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti’s
        1909
        <a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/%7Ecrshalizi/T4PM/futurist-manifesto.html" target="_blank">Futurist
          Manifesto</a>. Futurism, they might reasonably object, has been defined and even
        closed by the passage of time. Like modernism, it now belongs to the
        archive of concluded history. What exists today, and in the days to
        come, can only be a neo-futurism (and a neo-modernism): no less
        retrospective than prospective, as much a repetition as a speculation.
        Such considerations, corrections, and recollections, with all their
        attendant perplexities, are extremely welcome. The time to address
        them will soon come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Shanghai is cross-hatched with the time-fractured indices of
        historico-futuristic ambiguity, from
        <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/tape16/PQDD_0001/MQ29850.pdf"
          target="_blank">paleo-modernism</a>
        to
        <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/handmade-life/noted-the-landscapes-of-yang-yongliang-11955/"
          target="_blank">neo-traditionalism</a>, the blog will have every opportunity to discuss such things. For
        the moment, casual reference to the strangely-twinned architectural
        icons of such time-tangles, the Park Hotel and the Jinmao Tower – each
        a retro-futurist or cybergothic masterpiece – has to substitute as a
        mnemonic and promissory note.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in time, the obstacles to forecasting need to be thoroughly
        addressed: such topics as historical catastrophism, the
        <a href="http://www.alvinhan.com/Efficient-Market-Hypothesis.htm" target="_blank">efficient-market
          hypothesis</a>
        (EMH), Karl Popper’s
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RC-Bundle-Historicism-Routledge-Classics/dp/0415278465" target="_blank">critique
          of historicism</a>,
        <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/explained-knightian-0602.html" target="_blank">Knightian
          uncertainty</a>
        (or Rumsfeldian “<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2081042/" target="_blank">unknown unknowns</a>”) and the Black
        Swan theory of
        <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/" target="_blank">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>. In order to get up and
        running, all these complicating thoughts
        have been temporarily bracketed, like cunning and ferocious beasts,
        but they will not remain caged forever, or even very long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there’s something irresistibly twisted about starting with the
        future, the first flurry of posts will head straight into tomorrow,
        with topics becoming increasingly city- and Shanghai-focused as things
        progress. An initial series of interconnected posts will outline
        futuristic thinking in broad terms, including preliminary sketches of
        principal way-stations on the
        <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/cybsacad.html" target="_blank">mainline techno-scientific tradition</a>
        that supports it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, nothing relevant to the future of Shanghai is alien to
        this blog’s purpose. It will draw upon Shanghai
        <a href="http://web.mit.edu/lipoff/www/hapr/spring02_wto/shanghai.pdf" target="_blank">history</a>, geography,
        and

        <h4 class="post-title">Eternal Return, and After</h4>
      </a>
      <h5>
        <em>If occult knowledge is unavailable, futurology must rely upon
          historical patterns. Ultimately, some variant of extrapolation is
          its only resource.</em>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The hazards of extrapolation are manifold, and frequently
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-beware-extrapolating-trends" target="_blank">discussed</a>.
        A seemingly robust trend can be illusory, the shape of its curve
        can be misrecognized, and coincidental processes can disrupt it. Even
        more insidiously, the recognition of a trend can lead to responses
        that transform or nullify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, since governments, businesses, and individuals necessarily act in
        accordance with models of the future, forecasting is an incessant,
        inevitable, and often automatic feature of social existence. Whatever
        the complexities of prediction, survival depends upon future-adapted
        decision-making. A base-level futurism is simply unavoidable. Radical
        skepticism – irrespective of its intellectual merits — does not offer
        a practical alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are only four fundamental ways things can go: they can remain
        the same, they can cycle, they can shrink, or they can grow. In
        reality these trend-lines are usually inter-tangled. Among complex
        systems, stability is typically meta-stability, which is preserved
        through cycling, whilst growth and shrinkage are often components of a
        larger-scale, cyclic wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        The historical imagination of all ancient cultures was dominated by
        great cycles. In the Vedic culture of India, time unfolded as regular,
        degenerative epochs (yugas) that subdivided each ‘Day of Brahma’ (4.1
        billion years in length). Chinese time was shaped by the metabolism of
        Imperial dynasties. “Long united, the empire must divide. Long
        divided, it must unite,” begins the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
        Mesoamerican civilizations envisaged world history as a succession of
        creations and destructions. In the West, Plato described the history
        of the city as a great cycle, degenerating through phases of Timocracy
        (or rule by the virtuous), Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ages of mankind described by Hesiod, and later Ovid, are less
        obviously cyclical, as is the eschatological time inherited from
        ancient Judaism by the Abrahamic faiths. In these cases too, however,
        the course of history is understood as fundamentally degenerative, and
        guided to the restoration of a sacred origin (as described by Mircea
        Eliade in
        <a href="http://users.uoa.gr/~cdokou/MythLitMA/Eliade-EternalReturn.pdf" target="_blank">his analysis of the
          myth of Eternal Return</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Karl Marx remains captivated by this mythic historical pattern,
        in its Abrahamic variant. His epic of human social development begins
        with an Edenic ‘primitive communism’ that falls into the alienated
        degeneracy of class society, subdivided into a series of ages. The
        eschatological culmination of history in communist revolution thus
        completes a great cycle, sealed by a moment of sacred restoration (of
        authentic ‘species being’). It is no coincidence that this
        mytho-religious ‘big-picture’ aspect of Marxism has impinged far more
        deeply upon popular consciousness than its intricate mathematical
        model of techno-economic dynamics within ‘the capitalist mode of
        production’, despite the fact that Marx’s writings are overwhelmingly
        focused upon the latter. A great cycle feels like home.
      </p>
      <p>
        In modern times, the clearest example of history in the ancient, great
        cycle mode, is found in the work of another German socialist
        philosopher: Oswald Spengler. Modeling civilizations on the
        life-cycles of organic beings, he plotted their rise and inevitable
        decay through predictable phases. For the West, firmly locked into the
        downside of the wave, relentless, accelerating degeneration can be
        confidently anticipated. Spengler’s withering pessimism seems not to
        have detracted significantly from the cultural comfort derived from
        his archetypal historical scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eliade describes the myth of Eternal Return as a refuge from the
        “terror of history.” Firmly rooted in familiar organic patterns and
        the cycle of the seasons, it sets the basic template for traditional
        cultures. By identifying what is yet to come with what has already
        been timelessly commemorated, it promises the pre-adaptation of
        existing social arrangements and patterns of behavior to unencountered
        things, psychologically neutralizing the threat of radically
        unprecedented eventualities. We have been here before, and somehow we
        survived. Winter does not last forever.
      </p>

        It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that the conception of
        progressive historical time has been so slow to consolidate itself.
        John M. Smart summarizes the conclusions reached by historian J. D.
        Bury in his
        <em>The Idea of Progress</em> (1920),
        <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com/history_brief.html" target="_blank">noting</a>: “… the idea of
        progress in the material realm was missed,
        amazingly, even for most of the European Renaissance (…14th-17th
        century). Only by the 1650s, near the end of this cultural explosion,
        did the idea of an unstoppable force of progress finally begin to
        emerge as a possibility to the average literate mind.” The idea of
        progress, as continuous, innovative growth, is unique to modernity,
        and provides its defining cultural characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moderns found themselves, for the first time, cast outside the cosmic
        nursery of Eternal Return. A strange new world awaited them.

      <h5>
        <em>‘Urbanization’ doesn’t capture very much of what cities are up
          to</em>
      </h5>
      <p>
        (This post is basically a pre-emptive footnote. Please feel even freer
        to ignore it than you usually would.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The principal topic of Urban Future is the development of cities (with
        Shanghai as exemplary case). It is peculiarly frustrating, therefore,
        to find that no single term exists to describe a process that is
        arguably the most important of all social phenomena, and even the key
        to whatever meaning might be discoverable in human history.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing, at least, is clear (or should be): urban development is not
        <a href="http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/faculty/hodgson/Courses/so11/population/urbanization.htm"
          target="_blank">urbanization</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Urbanization’ is a comparatively rigorous and well-defined
        demographic concept, referring to the dynamic re-distribution of
        populations from non-urban to urban existence. Because it describes
        the proportion of city-dwellers within a population, it can be
        quantified by a percentage, which sets a strict mathematical limit to
        the process (asymptotic to 100% urbanized). When plotted historically,
        the approach to this limit follows a steep curve, echoing the
        (open-ended) exponential or super-exponential trends of modernization
        and industrialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst theoretically indispensable, clear, meaningful, and
        informative, the concept of urbanization is inadequate to the
        phenomenon of urban development. Cities are essentially
        concentrational, or intensive. They are defined by social density,
        uneven distribution, or demographic
        <a href="http://www.eoht.info/page/Negative+entropy" target="_blank">negative entropy</a>. Urbanization
        describes only a part of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the entire demographic system, urbanization provides a measure
        of the urban fraction (based on an at least semi-arbitrary definition
        of a city, by size and by boundary). It says nothing about the pattern
        of cities: how numerous they are, how they differ in relative scale,
        how fast larger cities grow compared to smaller ones, or in general
        whether the urbanized population is becoming more or less
        homogeneously distributed <em>between</em> cities. In fact, it tells
        us nothing at all about the distribution of the urbanized population,
        except that it is somehow clumped into ‘city-scale’ agglomerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once ‘clumped’ – or drawn within the spatial threshold of a city-sized
        cloud – a demographic particle switches binary identity, from
        non-urbanized to urbanized. Registered as a city-dweller, there is no
        more to be said about it. Yet the city is itself a distribution, of
        variable density, or heterogeneous concentration. <em>Within</em> each
        city, urban intensity can rise or fall, irrespective of the overall
        level of urbanization. The limit of urbanization sets no restriction
        upon trends to urban intensification, as exemplified by high-rise
        architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Urbanization is a proportional concept, indifferent to absolute
        demographic scale. In contrast, measuring intensity, or negative
        entropy, provides fine-grained information that rises with the size of
        the system considered (since the entropy measure is a logarithmic
        function of system scale, defined by the totality of possible
        distributions, which rises exponentially with population). Whilst
        social scientific or demographic phenomena are highly intractable to
        quantitative intensive analysis, their reality is nevertheless
        intensive, which is to say: determined by distributive variation of
        <em>absolute</em> magnitudes. The measure of urbanization is not
        affected by the doubling of a city’s population unless the overall
        population grows at a lower rate. Urban intensity, in contrast, is
        highly sensitive to absolute demographic fluctuation (and not
        uncommonly hyper-sensitive).
      </p>
      <p>
        Intensities are characterized by transition thresholds. As they rise
        and fall, they cross ‘singularities’ or ‘phase transitions’ that mark
        a change in nature. A small change in intensive magnitude can trigger
        a catastrophic change in system behavior, with the
        <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/emergence/" target="_blank">emergence</a>
        of previously undisclosed properties. When measuring urbanization, a
        city is a city is a city. As an intensive concentration, however, a
        city is an essentially variable real individual, passing through
        thresholds as it grows, innovating unprecedented behaviors, and thus
        becoming something ‘qualitatively’ new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst summoning the courage to float an adequate neologism
        (‘urbanomy’?), Urban Future will stumble onwards with awkward
        compounds such as ‘urban development’, ‘urban intensification’, ‘urban
        condensation’, or whatever seems least painful at the time (whilst
        meaning, in each case, what ‘urbanization’ would describe if urbanists
        had managed to grab it before the demographers did).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, despite this linguistic obstacle, a surprising amount can be said
        about the urban process in general. Making a start on that comes next.

      <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/an-introduction-to-urbanomy/">
        <h4 class="post-title">An Introduction to Urbanomy</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        However irritating neologisms can be, they are sometimes
        near-compulsory. When a compact, comparatively simple thought is
        forced to route itself, repeatedly, through crudely-stitched
        terminological tangles, the missing <em>adequate word</em> fosters the
        linguistic equivalent of a nagging hunger. Word invention becomes a
        simple prerequisite of smooth cognitive function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Urban development of the individual city, or the typical process of
        urban maturation, is a quite basic but linguistically underserved
        concept of exactly this kind. The absence is aggravated by the
        presence of another word — one that sounds superficially suitable, but
        which actually designates an entirely separate idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a city grows, it does not ‘urbanize’ (only a wider social system
        can do that). Urbanization applies to a society that becomes
        proportionately more urban, as rural people move into cities, but when
        an individual city develops – and in fact individuates – it undergoes
        <a href="http://thatsmags.com/shanghai/blog/view/243"><em>urbanomy </em></a>(on the model of ‘teleonomy’).
        Urbanomy – urban self-organization —
        is far more critical to this blog than urbanization is. Coining the
        term is a declaration of theoretical commitment to urban individuation
        as a structured – and thus cognitively-tractable – social, historical,
        and ultimately cosmic reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-37"></span>The foundations of urbanomic understanding
        were laid down by Jane Jacobs in her book
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/039470584X"><em>The Economy of Cities</em></a>. In this work she outlines a
        simple and powerful theory of urban
        self-organization, driven by a spontaneous economic process of
        <em>import replacement</em>. Cities develop by autonomization, or
        introversion, which occurs as they learn from trade, progressively
        transforming an ever-greater proportion of their commercial flows into
        endogenous circuits. This (urbanomic) tendency need not isolate cities
        from the world, but it necessarily converts stable dependency into
        dynamic interaction, driving continuous commercial modification. The
        logistical and informational advantages of local urban producers –
        minimizing transport costs and maximizing feedback intensity – tend to
        encourage the internalization of productive activity, teaching the
        city what it can do for itself, and consolidating its singular
        identity (as a real individual). The growth, complexification, and
        individuation of the city are integral to a single urbanomic process.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is urbanomy that produces cities, with urbanization – typically –
        occurring as a secondary phenomenon. Functional cities are not
        demographic dumping grounds, but endogenously maturing entities which
        draw things (including people) into themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the many side-consequences running off Jacobs’ thesis, one in
        particular is so historically-suggestive that it merits a short
        digression. Since cities are not nutritionally self-supporting, it has
        been natural to assume that they presuppose settled agriculture, which
        they relate to in a way that is – at least calorically – parasitic.
        Jacobs turns this assumption upside down, proposing instead that the
        commercialization of food production which accompanied the emergence
        of cities was itself a crucial motor of agriculturalization. By
        providing concentrated, comparatively large-scale markets, cities made
        the production of substantial food-surpluses economically rational for
        the first time, automatically supporting their own further development
        in interactive lock-step with the Neolithic revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic urbanomic insight of greatest relevance here, however, is
        more abstract. The Jacobs thesis establishes a framework for
        systematically exploring the time-structure of the urban process,
        conceived not solely as a (prolonged) episode in time, or history, but
        also as the working of a <em>chronogenic</em>, or time-making social
        machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept which Jacobs tacitly introduces, as the guiding principle
        of the urbanomic trend, is <em>autoproduction</em>. As it grows,
        internally specializes, self-organizes, dissipates entropy, and
        individuates, the city tends to an impossible limit of complete
        productive autonomy. It appears as a convergent wave, shaped in the
        direction of increasing order or complexity, as if by an invisible
        hand, or according to an intelligent design. The pattern is exactly
        what would be expected if something not yet realized was orchestrating
        its self-creation. Even after 150 years of coherent evolutionary
        theory, such processes – in the absence of a dominating creative agent
        – appear extraordinary, and even uncanny, because they seem to run
        backwards, against the current of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time as it is lived and explored is <em>tensed</em>. It is occupied
        from the middle, which is always now, and from which the past recedes
        (partially remembered, or recorded), as the future approaches
        (partially anticipated, or forecast). The time-line crossing ‘now’ or
        the present is asymmetric. It has an ‘arrow’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mainstream scientific currents which support the modern
        understanding of the world describe this arrow of time in two very
        different ways. Both are easily intuited and generally accepted, at
        least in their broadest outlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, we are told that the arrow of time corresponds to an increase
        of disorder. Things break, erode, age, die, and decay. Presented with
        two photographs, of an intact egg and the same egg smashed, there is
        no doubt about which came first. Eggs don’t unsmash, time doesn’t
        reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except that (secondly) we generally anticipate progress, or
        improvement. Knowledge accumulates, inventions are made, economies are
        expected, normally, to grow. Even those most resistant to modern
        messages – such as evolutionary ideas — work confidently to produce
        order in their lives, when tidying, sorting, assembling, organizing,
        or composing. Eggs might not unsmash, but there are eggs, and they’ve
        been made somehow (there weren’t any 500 million years ago).
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do our time intuitions align with the arrow of time? Which way
        is forward, and which is back? Between increasing and decreasing
        order, which seems normal and which strange?
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions are complicated by the fact that we mentally process
        the world in two very different ways, dividing it as neatly as
        possible between people and things, agency and inertia, the animate
        and the inanimate, teleology and mechanism. This very basic dual
        system of perceptual classification – almost certainly supported by
        deeply archaic neurological structures — corresponds to a twin
        cognitive apparatus of profound expectation. Categorical violations
        are viscerally unsettling.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people – or even ‘lower’ animals — behave as things, they
        primitively evoke the dread of morbidity, mortality, and more radical
        varieties of cosmic wrongness, partially captured by the figure of the
        zombie. The intermediate zone, of the ‘living dead’, can be entered
        from either direction, triggering an archaic revulsion from
        monstrosity – the most fundamental of all
        <em>things that should not be</em>. Horror fiction dwells almost
        entirely in this twilight world of categorical slippage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When order emerges spontaneously among things, it seems like magic (in
        the ancient, soul-seizing sense), and panicked spectators reflexively
        grasp for the hidden agents of ‘animistic’ or religious
        interpretation, compelled by categorical intuitions far older than the
        human species. Calm apprehension of such ‘teleonomies’ is grounded,
        perhaps invariably, in an attenuation or vagueness of distinct
        perception. Were a biologist to truly <em>perceive</em> the
        evolutionary process, its integral, primordial horror would be
        ineluctable. Urbanomy, likewise, belongs to the realm of real
        monstrosity. That is one reason why cities cannot readily be seen for
        what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spontaneous animation, horror, and time-reversal are inextricably
        knotted together at the root of their apprehension. The human
        nervous-system cannot register a deeper <em>wrong</em> than an
        inversion of time, as demonstrated by a thing that
        <em>comes to life</em>. Cities, eventually, will scare us. In doing
        so, they will draw us out beyond what has been – to date — the horizon
        of intelligible time.

        <em>People gravitate to cities, but what are cities gravitating into?
          Some strange possibilities suggest themselves.</em>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Cities are defined by social density. This simple but hugely
        consequential insight provides the central thesis of Edward Glaeser’s
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-%20%20Healthier/dp/159420277X"
          target="_blank">Triumph of the City: How our Greatest Invention Makes us Richer,
          Smarter, Greener, Healthier and Happier</a>
        (2011), where it is framed as both an analytical tool and a political
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Cities are the absence of physical space between people and
        companies. They enable us to work and play together, and their success
        depends on the demand for physical connection,” Glaeser remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-density urban life approaches a tautology, and it is one that
        Glaeser not only observes, but also celebrates. Closely-packed people
        are more productive. As Alfred Marshall noted in 1920, ‘agglomeration
        economies’ feed a self-reinforcing process of social compression that
        systematically out-competes diffuse populations in all fields of
        industrial activity. In addition, urbanites are also happier,
        longer-living, and their ecological footprint is smaller, Glaeser
        insists, drawing upon a variety of social scientific evidence to make
        his case. Whether social problems are articulated in economic,
        hedonic, or environmental terms, (dense) urbanism offers the most
        practical solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conclusion Glaeser draws, logically enough, is that densification
        should be encouraged, rather than inhibited. He interprets sprawl as a
        reflection of perverse incentives, whilst systematically contesting
        the policy choices that restrain the trend to continuous urban
        compression. His most determined line of argumentation is directed in
        favor of high-rise development, and against the planning restrictions
        that keep cities stunted. A city that is prevented from soaring will
        be over-expensive and under-excited, inflexible, inefficient, dirty,
        backward-looking, and peripherally sprawl- or slum-cluttered. Onwards
        and upwards is the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Urban planning has its own measure for density: the FAR (or
        Floor-to-Area Ratio), typically determined as a limit set upon
        permitted concentration. An FAR of 2, for instance, allows a developer
        to build a two-story building over an entire area, a four-story
        building on half the area, or an eight-story building on a quarter of
        the area. An FAR sets an average ceiling on urban development. It is
        essentially a bureaucratic device for deliberately stunting vertical
        growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Glaeser shows, Mumbai’s urban development problems have been
        all-but-inevitable given the quite ludicrous FAR of 1.33 that was set
        for India’s commercial capital in 1964. Sprawling slum development has
        been the entirely predictable outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst sparring with Jane Jacobs over the impact of high-rise
        construction on urban life, Glaeser is ultimately in agreement on the
        importance of organic development, based on spontaneous patterns of
        growth. Both attribute the most ruinous urban problems to policy
        errors, most obviously the attempt to channel – and in fact deform –
        the urban process through arrogant bureaucratic fiat. When cities fail
        to do what comes naturally, they fail, and what comes naturally,
        Glaeser argues, is densification.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be elegant to refer to this deep trend towards social
        compression, the emergence, growth, and intensification of urban
        settlement, as urbanization,
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/beyond-urbanization/">but we can’t do that</a>. Even when
        awkwardly named, however, it exposes a profound social
        and historical reality, with striking implications, amounting almost
        to a specifically social law of gravitation. As with physical gravity,
        an understanding of the forces of social attraction support
        predictions, or at least the broad outlines of futuristic
        anticipation, since these forces of agglomeration and intensification
        manifestly shape the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com/" target="_blank">John M. Smart</a>
        makes only passing references to cities, but his Developmental
        Singularity (DS) hypothesis is especially relevant to urban theory
        because it focuses upon the topic of density. He
        <a href="http://accelerating.org/downloads/SmartEvoDevoUniv2008.pdf" target="_blank">argues</a>
        that acceleration, or time-compression, is only one aspect of a
        general evolutionary (more precisely, evolutionary-developmental, or
        ‘evo devo’) trend that envelops space, time, energy, and mass. This
        ‘STEM-compression’ is identified with ascending intelligence (and
        negative entropy). It reflects a deep cosmic-historical drive to the
        augmentation of computational capacity that marries “<em>evolutionary processes</em>
        that are stochastic, creative, and divergent [with]
        <em>developmental processes</em> that produce statistically
        predictable, robust, conservative, and convergent structures and
        trajectories.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart notes that “the leading edge of structural complexity in our
        universe has apparently transitioned from universally distributed
        early matter, to galaxies, to replicating stars within galaxies, to
        solar systems in galactic habitable zones, to life on special planets
        in those zones, to higher life within the surface biomass, to cities,
        and soon, to intelligent technology, which will be a vastly more local
        subset of Earth’s city space.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Audaciously, Smart projects this trend to its limit: “Current research
        (Aaronson 2006, 2008) now suggests that building future computers
        based on quantum theory, one of the two great theories of 20th century
        physics, will not yield exponentially, but only
        <em>quadratically</em> growing computational capacity over today’s
        classical computing. In the search for truly disruptive future
        computational capacity emergence, we can therefore look to the second
        great physical theory of the last century, relativity. If the DS
        hypothesis is correct, what we can call relativistic computing (a
        black-hole-approximating computing substrate) will be the final common
        attractor for all successfully developing universal civilizations.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceive the histories of cities, therefore, as the initial segments
        of trajectories that curve asymptotically to infinite density, at the
        ultimate event horizon of the physical universe. The beginning is
        recorded fact and the end is quite literally ‘gone’, but what lies in
        between, i.e. next?

        <em>We could be on the brink of a catastrophic implosion – but that’s
          OK</em>
      </h5>

        Science fiction has tended to extroversion. In America especially,
        where it found a natural home among an unusually future-oriented
        people, the iconic SF object was indisputably the space ship,
        departing the confines of Earth for untrammeled frontiers. The future
        was measured by the weakening of the terrestrial gravity well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cyberpunk, arriving in the mid-1980s, delivered a cultural shock.
        William Gibson’s
        <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            target="_blank">Neuromancer</a></em>
        still included some (Earth-orbital) space activity – and even a
        communication from Alpha Centauri — but its voyages now curved into
        the inner space of computer systems, projected through the starless
        tracts of Cyberspace. Interstellar communication bypassed biological
        species, and took place between planetary artificial intelligences.
        The United States of America seemed to have disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Space and time had collapsed, into the ‘cyberspace matrix’ and the
        near-future. Even the abstract distances of social utopianism had been
        incinerated in the processing cores of micro-electronics. Judged by
        the criteria of mainstream science fiction, everything cyberpunk
        touched upon was gratingly close, and still closing in. The future had
        become imminent, and skin-tight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gibson’s cities had not kept up with his wider – or narrower – vision.
        The urban spaces of his East Coast North America were still described
        as ‘The Sprawl’, as if stranded in a rapidly-obsolescing state of
        extension. The crushing forces of technological compression had leapt
        beyond social geography, sucking all historical animation from the
        decaying husks of ‘meat space’. Buildings were relics, bypassed by the
        leading edge of change.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Gibson’s Asian city-references are, however, far more intense,
        inspired by such innovations in urban compression as the Kowloon
        Walled City, and Japanese ‘coffin hotels’. In addition, Urbanists
        disappointed by first-wave cyberpunk have every reason to continue on
        into
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spook
            Country</a></em>, where the influence of GPS-technology on the re-animation of urban
        space nourishes highly fertile speculations.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Star cruisers and alien civilizations belong to the same science
        fiction constellation, brought together by the assumption of
        expansionism. Just as, in the realm of fiction, this ‘space opera’
        future collapsed into cyberpunk, in (more or less) mainstream science
        – represented by SETI programs – it perished in the desert of the
        <a href="http://www.fermisparadox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fermi Paradox</a>. (OK, it’s
        true, Urban Future has a bizarrely nerdish obsession with
        this topic.)
      </p>
      <p>
        John M. Smart’s solution to the Fermi Paradox is integral to his
        broader ‘Speculations on Cosmic Culture’ and emerges naturally from
        <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com/developmentalsinghypothesis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank">compressive development</a>. Advanced intelligences do not expand into space, colonizing vast
        galactic tracts or dispersing self-replicating robot probes in a
        program of exploration. Instead, they implode, in a process of
        ‘transcension’ — resourcing themselves primarily through the
        hyper-exponential efficiency gains of extreme miniaturization (through
        micro- and nano- to femto-scale engineering, of subatomic functional
        components). Such cultures or civilizations, nucleated upon
        self-augmenting technological intelligence, emigrate from the
        extensive universe in the direction of abysmal intensity, crushing
        themselves to near-black-hole densities at the edge of physical
        possibility. Through transcension, they withdraw from extensive
        communication (whilst, perhaps, leaving ‘radio fossils’ behind, before
        these blink-out into the silence of cosmic escape).
      </p>
      <p>
        If Smart’s speculations capture the basic outlines of a
        density-attracted developmental system, then cities should be expected
        to follow a comparable path, characterized by an escape into
        inwardness, an interior voyage, involution, or implosion. Approaching
        singularity on an accelerating trajectory, each city becomes
        increasingly inwardly directed, as it falls prey to the irresistible
        attraction of its own hyperbolic intensification, whilst the outside
        world fades to irrelevant static. Things disappear into cities, on a
        path of departure from the world. Their destination cannot be
        described within the dimensions of the known – and, indeed, tediously
        over-familiar – universe. Only in the deep exploratory interior is
        innovation still occurring, but there it takes place at an infernal,
        time-melting rate.
      </p>
      <p>What might Smart-type urban development suggest?</p>
      <p>
        (a) Devo Predictability. If urban development is neither randomly
        generated by internal processes, nor arbitrarily determined by
        external decisions, but rather guided predominantly by a developmental
        attractor (defined primarily by intensification), it follows that the
        future of cities is at least partially autonomous in regards to the
        national-political, global-economic, and cultural-architectural
        influences that are often invoked as fundamentally explanatory.
        Urbanism can be facilitated or frustrated, but its principal ‘goals’
        and practical development paths are, in each individual case,
        internally and automatically generated. When a city ‘works’ it is not
        because it conforms to an external, debatable ideal, but rather
        because it has found a route to cumulative intensification that
        strongly projects its ‘own’, singular and intrinsic, urban character.
        What a city wants is to become itself, but more — taking itself
        further and faster. That alone is urban flourishing, and understanding
        it is the key that unlocks the shape of any city’s future.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Metropolitanism. Methodological nationalism has been
        systematically over-emphasized in the social sciences (and not only at
        the expense of methodological individualism). A variety of influential
        urban thinkers, from Jane Jacobs to Peter Hall, have sought to correct
        this bias by focusing upon the significance, and partial autonomy, of
        urban economies, urban cultures, and municipal politics to aggregate
        prosperity, civilization, and golden ages. They have been right to do
        so. City growth is the basic socio-historical phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) Cultural Introversion. John Smart argues that an intelligence
        undergoing advanced relativistic development finds the external
        landscape increasingly uninformative and non-absorbing. The search for
        cognitive stimulation draws it inwards. As urban cultures evolve,
        through accelerating social complexity, they can be expected to
        manifest exactly this pattern. Their internal processes, of runaway
        intelligence implosion, become ever more gripping, engaging,
        surprising, productive, and educational, whilst the wider cultural
        landscape subsides into predictable tedium, of merely ethnographic and
        historical relevance. Cultural singularity becomes increasingly
        urban-futural (rather than ethno-historical), to the predictable
        disgruntlement of traditional nation states. Like Gibson’s Terrestrial
        Cyberspace, encountering another of its kind in orbit around Alpha
        Centauri, cosmopolitan connectivity is made through inner voyage,
        rather than expansionary outreach.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Scale Resonance. At the most abstract level, the relation between
        urbanism and microelectronics is scalar (fractal). The coming
        computers are closer to miniature cities than to artificial brains,
        dominated by traffic problems (congestion), migration /
        communications, zoning issues (mixed use), the engineering potential
        of new materials, questions of dimensionality (3D solutions to density
        constraints), entropy or heat / waste dissipation (recycling /
        reversible computation), and disease control (new viruses). Because
        cities, like computers, exhibit (accelerating phylogenetic)
        development within observable historical time, they provide a
        realistic model of improvement for compact information-processing
        machinery, sedimented as a series of practical solutions to the
        problem of relentless intensification. Brain-emulation might be
        considered an important computational goal, but it is near-useless as
        a developmental model. Intelligent microelectronic technologies
        contribute to the open-ended process of urban problem-solving, but
        they also recapitulate it at a new level.
      </p>
      <p>
        (e) Urban Matrix. Does urban development exhibit the real
        embryogenesis of artificial intelligence? Rather than the global
        Internet, military Skynet, or lab-based AI program, is it the path of
        the city, based on accelerating intensification (STEM compression),
        that best provides the conditions for emergent super-human
        computation? Perhaps the main reason for thinking so is that the
        problem of the city – density management and accentuation – already
        commits it to computational engineering, in advance of any
        deliberately guided research. The city, by its very nature,
        compresses, or intensifies, towards computronium. When the first AI
        speaks, it might be in the name of the city that it identifies as its
        body, although even that would be little more than a ‘radio fossil’ —
        a signal announcing the brink of silence — as the path of implosion
        deepens, and disappears into the alien interior.

      <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/scaly-creatures/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Scaly Creatures</h4>
      </a>
      <h5>
        <em>Cities are accelerators and there are solid numbers to demonstrate
          it</em>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Among the most memorable features of Shanghai’s 2010 World Expo was
        the quintet of ‘Theme Pavilions’ designed to facilitate exploration of
        the city in general (in keeping with the urban-oriented theme of the
        event: ‘Better City, Better Life’). Whilst many international
        participants succumbed to facile populism in their national pavilions,
        these Theme Pavilions maintained an impressively high-minded tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most remarkable of all for philosophical penetration was the Urban
        Being Pavilion, with its exhibition devoted to the question: what kind
        of thing is a city? Infrastructural networks received especially
        focused scrutiny. Pipes, cables, conduits, and transport arteries
        compose intuitively identifiable systems – higher-level wholes – that
        strongly indicate the existence of an individualized, complex being.
        The conclusion was starkly inescapable: a city is more than just an
        aggregated mass. It is a singular, coherent entity, deserving of its
        proper – even personal – name, and not unreasonably conceived as a
        composite ‘life-form’ (if not exactly an ‘organism’).
      </p>
      <p>
        Such intuitions, however plausible, do not suffice in themselves to
        establish the city as a rigorously-defined scientific object.
        “[D]espite much historical evidence that cities are the principle
        engines of innovation and economic growth, a quantitative, predictive
        theory for understanding their dynamics and organization and
        estimating their future trajectory and stability remains elusive,”
        remark Luís M. A. Bettencourt, José Lobo, Dirk Helbing, Christian
        Kühnert, and Geoffrey B. West, in their prelude to a 2007 paper that
        has done more than any other to remedy the deficit: ‘<a
          href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/17/7301.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">Growth, innovation, scaling, and
          the pace of life in cities</a>‘.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper, the authors identify mathematical patterns that are at
        once distinctive to the urban phenomenon and generally applicable to
        it. They thus isolate the object of an emerging urban science, and
        outline its initial features, claiming that: “the social organization
        and dynamics relating urbanization to economic development and
        knowledge creation, among other social activities, are very general
        and appear as nontrivial quantitative regularities common to all
        cities, across urban systems.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Noting that cities have often been analogized to biological systems,
        the paper extracts the principle supporting the comparison.
        “Remarkably, almost all physiological characteristics of biological
        organisms scale with body mass … as a power law whose exponent is
        typically a multiple of 1/4 (which generalizes to 1/(d +1) in
        d-dimensions).” These relatively stable scaling relations allow
        biological features, such as metabolic rates, life spans, and
        maturation periods, to be anticipated with a high-level of confidence
        given body mass alone. Furthermore, they conform to an elegant series
        of theoretical expectations that draw upon nothing beyond the abstract
        organizational constraints of n-dimensional space:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Highly complex, self-sustaining structures, whether cells,
          organisms, or cities, require close integration of enormous numbers
          of constituent units that need efficient servicing. To accomplish
          this integration, life at all scales is sustained by optimized,
          space-filling, hierarchical branching networks, which grow with the
          size of the organism as uniquely specified approximately
          self-similar structures. Because these networks, e.g., the vascular
          systems of animals and plants, determine the rates at which energy
          is delivered to functional terminal units (cells), they set the pace
          of physiological processes as scaling functions of the size of the
          organism. Thus, the self-similar nature of resource distribution
          networks, common to all organisms, provides the basis for a
          quantitative, predictive theory of biological structure and
          dynamics, despite much external variation in appearance and form.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If cities are in certain respects meta- or super-organisms, however,
        they are also the inverse. Metabolically, cities are anti-organisms.
        As biological systems scale up, they slow down, at a mathematically
        predictable rate. Cities, in contrast, accelerate as they grow.
        Something approximating to the fundamental law of urban reality is
        thus exposed: larger is faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper quantifies its findings, based on a substantial base of city
        data (with US cities over-represented), by specifying a ‘scaling
        exponent’ (or ‘ß‘, beta) that defines the regular correlation between
        urban scale and the factor under consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        A beta of one corresponds to linear correlation (of a variable to city
        size). For instance, housing supply, which remains constantly
        proportional to population across all urban scales, is found –
        unsurprisingly – to have ß = 1.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        A beta of less than one indicates consistent economy to scale. Such
        economies are found systematically among urban resource networks,
        exemplified by gasoline stations (ß = 0.77), gasoline sales (ß =
        0.79), length of electrical cables (ß = 0.87), and road surface (ß =
        0.83). The sub-linear correlation of resource costs to urban scale
        makes city life increasingly efficient as metropolitan intensity
        soars.
      </p>
      <p>
        A beta of greater than one indicates increasing returns to scale.
        Factors exhibiting this pattern include inventiveness (e.g. ‘new
        patents’ß = 1.27, ‘inventors’ ß = 1.25), wealth creation (e.g. ‘GDP’ ß
        = 1.15, wages ß = 1.12), but also disease (‘new AIDS cases’ ß = 1.23),
        and serious crimes (ß = 1.16). Urban growth is accompanied by a
        super-linear rise in opportunity for social interaction, whether
        productive, infectious, or malicious. More is not only better, it’s
        <em>much</em> better (and, in some respects, worse).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “Our analysis suggests uniquely human social dynamics that transcend
          biology and redefine metaphors of urban ‘metabolism’. Open-ended
          wealth and knowledge creation require the pace of life to increase
          with organization size and for individuals and institutions to adapt
          at a continually accelerating rate to avoid stagnation or potential
          crises. These conclusions very likely generalize to other social
          organizations, such as corporations and businesses, potentially
          explaining why continuous growth necessitates an accelerating
          treadmill of dynamical cycles of innovation.”
        </p>

        <em>that’s Shanghai interviews the world’s most topical urbanist</em>
      </h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Shanghai isn’t one of the featured cities in your book. It’s
          massive and massively high-rise. Did you ever consider writing about
          it?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Shanghai is one of the world’s great cities, but I don’t know the city
        well enough to write about it. I hope to get to know the city better
        and feature Shanghai’s successes in some later work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>China is a place where cities have grown incredibly quickly and
          there’s been a massive exodus from the countryside to urban life.
          What do you think China’s cities should focus on as they
          grow?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cities, today, succeed as forges of human capital and engines of
        innovation. China clearly recognizes this and is investing massively
        in education. That should continue. Just as importantly, China needs
        to focus on fostering more entrepreneurship by eliminating any
        remaining barriers to small start-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You talk about how cities should be seen as “masses of connected
          humanity,” rather than agglomerations of buildings. Do you think
          this is well understood at this point, or are too many places still
          attempting to “build their way back to success”?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, too often political leaders try to garner headlines
        with a splashy new structure. The key is to focus on those
        infrastructure investments that will really benefit the people in the
        city.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Are you optimistic about city planners around the world finding the
          balance between Paris and Mumbai, i.e. between Haussman-style
          central planning that risks sterility and a chaotic
          free-for-all?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s the 10 trillion dollar question. I wish I could be more
        optimistic, but city planning is hard and many governments are either
        unable to manage chaos or too inclined to central control. This
        requires not just knowledge but political strength and that’s a rare
        combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Which cities around the world are getting it right? Which
          aren’t?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that Singapore is the best-managed city in the world – good
        schools, a superb transportation policy, and a sensible approach to
        regulation. But Hong Kong is also quite impressive, and I personally
        prefer it’s somewhat more chaotic style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The west has many urban powerhouses, but few of them are really models
        of perfect management. For example, I am a big fan of Mayor Menino in
        Boston, but despite more than 15 years of hard work, Boston’s schools
        are still struggling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, Barcelona, Paris, and Milan are all lovely, wonderful
        cities, but they are not necessarily models of good management.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You’re cautiously optimistic in your book, but what worries you
          most about the future of the city?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenges are in the mega-cities of the developing world,
        especially Africa. We are a very long way from providing even the core
        essentially like clean water in many places.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the US, we have huge problems of fiscal mismanagement that need to
        be addressed. Moreover, there is always the possibility of really
        major physical disasters – either natural or man-made.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Is there any way around the fact that the most vibrant cities also
          become the most expensive – or, as you say in the book, is this
          simply the price of good urban health?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The laws of supply and demand cannot be repealed. If a city is
        attractive and productive, demand for its real estate will be high.
        The best antidote for that is abundant supply, but it is a mistake to
        subsidize urban housing. The best path towards greater affordability
        comes from private housing construction that is regulated only as much
        as is absolutely necessary. Still, building up can be expensive and
        that will always make prices in successful cities more expensive.
      </p>

        <strong>By functioning as engines of economic opportunity and as refuges,
          cities tend to concentrate economic disparity. Do you think a case
          might be made that such inequalities could be interpreted as a
          symptom of urban success? Might you be subtly suggesting this in
          your own work?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am suggesting just that. National inequality can be a real problem,
        but local inequality can be a sign of health. Cities don’t typically
        make people poor they attract poor people. The inequality of a city
        reflects the fact that it attracts rich and poor alike, and that’s
        something to admire.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can cities strive to control inequality and avoid ghettos of
          rich and poor? Should they even be trying to?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Education is the best weapon against inequality. Cities should be
        striving to make sure that the children of every parent have a chance
        of being successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some degree of stratification by income is inevitable, but segregation
        can be quite costly because such separations mean that isolated people
        lose the urban advantages of connection. There aren’t great tools for
        reducing segregation, but governments should make sure that their
        policies do not exacerbate segregation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Geoffrey West at the Santa Fe Institute has been studying cities as
          ‘complex systems’ and identified a number of reliable and
          quantifiable patterns on this basis. Do you find this type of
          analysis informative or relevant to your work?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Cities are indeed complex systems.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Even in the modern world, with nationalism ascendant, city states
          seem to be unusually successful. Do cities provide a challenge to
          dominant conceptions of large-scale political organization? How do
          you rate the prospects of devolutionary politics, with a municipal
          emphasis?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t think that nation-states will be likely to surrender all that
        much power, and cities can remain economically dominant but
        politically weak. The path in the US has continued to be towards more,
        not less, national power and I think that is probably a mistake. In
        many cases – such as Mumbai – local choices would surely be better
        than the choices imposed on cities by above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other than your own work, who do you consider to be the most
          important writers on cities today?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>I deeply admire the Columbia historian Kenneth Jackson.</p>

        (2011) McKinsey study of urban contribution to world GDP. The top
        bullet-point take-away: “only 600 urban centers generate about 60
        percent of global GDP.” Yet, because cities, as nodes in a global
        economic network, are distributed by a power law, any picture drawn by
        the top 600 urban centers tends to strongly de-dramatize the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wikipedia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP">has</a> a
        helpful table of world cities with a variety of GDP estimates. (The
        Brookings Institute figures are the most complete, and also the most
        generous.) From these it can be seen that Tokyo, on its own, accounts
        for almost 2% of world GDP. The world’s 10 most productive cities —
        Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, New York, Osaka/Kobe, Paris,
        Seoul, Shanghai, and Tokyo — account for roughly 10% of total global
        economic output between them. The next thirty cities together do not
        quite double this figure, and from then on, the contribution of each
        city added dwindles rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        McKinsey estimates the economic weight of the world’s “23 megacities —
        with populations of 10 million or more” somewhat more modestly, at 14%
        of global GDP. It expects them to contribute no more than 10% of
        global growth through to 2025, while: “In contrast, 577 middleweights
        — cities with populations of between 150,000 and 10 million, are seen
        contributing more than half of global growth to 2025, gaining share
        from today’s megacities. By 2025, 13 middleweights are likely to be
        have become megacities, 12 of which are in emerging-markets (the
        exception is Chicago) and seven in China alone.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>UF</em> anticipates that the combination of continued urban
        agglomeration and economic concentration will tend to steepen the
        distribution, but the secular shift of economic gravity from West to
        East will dampen this pattern in the short-medium term. If, by
        mid-century, there is not a single Chinese economic center accounting
        for more than 3% of total global economic production, all our
        expectations about the world will have been proven wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: A mid-century prediction isn’t very audacious, but it’s
        timidity is drawn from an important pattern of change. The world’s two
        most productive cities, by far, are Tokyo and New York, and both are
        likely to see their relative contribution to global GDP shrink
        substantially over coming decades. In consequence, the near-term
        shifts in the distribution of economic activity will appear as a
        dilution, until a new ‘capital’ of world commerce emerges — in a
        process that can be expected to take at least 20 years.

        Gentrification is the topic everyone is discussing, with the
        systematic pricing-out of problem populations (to provincial
        demographic dump-zones) as the scandal no one in polite society can
        admit to any ambivalence about. It’s unspeakable, of course,
        especially since it is making the place so much nicer. An undertow of
        London secessionist rumor — straight out of <em>The Peripheral</em> —
        adds to the dark buzz. Also crucial is the “best horse in the
        glue-factory” dividend from the implosion of continental Europe.

        <em>Both Schumacher’s and Hadid’s language propose an architecture
          that’s “above” trivial moral and political hand-wringing, like

          recent CalArts panel, described Schumacher’s
          style as “über-form,” meaning that it takes on the aesthetic of the
          universal and inevitable in order to create icons of an imaginary
          future. And <strong>that</strong> is what China and the Emirates are
          buying — the Seoul Design Park, Galaxy SOHO, Guangzhou Opera House,

        aligned with the deep planetary current.

        <span id="more-7046"></span><a href="http://freecitiesinitiative.com/the-normality-of-free-cities/">This</a>
        is the idea:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is new about free cities is not the policies they will likely
          implement, but the manner in which those policies are implemented.
          The traditional model is that the nation state creates a legal
          baseline. Cities and towns can add to that baseline, increasing
          taxes or regulatory requirements for example, but not opt out of it.
          A special economic zone is an institutional arrangement which allows
          territories to opt out of aspects of the institutional baseline. […]
          A free city is an institutional arrangement which allows a territory
          to opt out of most aspects of the institutional baseline. In recent
          history, this is a radical change. However, it is a radical change
          necessary to import good institutions; rule of law, property rights,
          and economic freedom. We already know what works. Free cities offer
          a path to get there.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And
        <a href="http://freecitiesinitiative.com/free-cities-trends/">this</a>
        is the trend:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… free cities are by and large inevitable. … Two trends, which are
          not yet common knowledge, point to the emergence of free cities.
          Those trends are the creation of special economic zones (SEZs) and
          new cities. … SEZs are forerunners to free cities, they are pockets
          of autonomy where certain national laws and regulations do not
          apply. Of course, they differ in several important aspects. First,
          SEZs are typically small, rarely encompassing a city. Second, the
          autonomy for most SEZs is relatively minor. Such autonomy might
          encompass lower taxes or expedited customs, but does not represent a
          new legal system, merely slight alterations to the existing one. […]
          Nevertheless, SEZs represent something of a challenge to the
          traditional notion of a nation state, an area where a sovereign body
          sets the baseline legal standard. As such, it is reasonable to
          suggest that the number and trend of SEZs is roughly correlated with
          the likelihood of building a free city. A world where minor autonomy
          is acceptable is more likely to accept major autonomy than a world
          where no autonomy is acceptable. […] The trends of SEZs suggest that
          autonomy is becoming increasingly acceptable. …</em>

          Modernity’s Fertility Problem

      <p>
        The techno-commercial wing of the neoreactionary blogosphere has an
        obvious fondness for Pacific Rim city states. Singapore, along with
        Hong Kong (a PRC ‘Special Administrative Region’ which retains
        significant trappings of autonomy), are regularly invoked as
        socio-political models. The striking difference between the two
        societies only confirms the merits of what they share. “If you love
        minimal democracy capitalist enclaves so much, why not move to
        Singapore (or Hong Kong)?” is a notably ineffective challenge to this
        constituency. Those who haven’t already fled there – or somewhere else
        that is in important respects comparable – can only see the prospect
        of such an exile as a tempting invitation. It’s not quite “Go to
        heaven!” but it’s as close as political polemic gets. The asymmetry is
        decisive. Unlike any concrete approximation to a left-utopian social
        model that has ever been available, these are societies that
        incontestably work, with attractions that require no active propaganda
        operation to support. The right rises because – unlike its enemies –
        it can find examples of what it admires that aren’t agonizingly
        embarrassing upon close inspection. Seriously, be our guests and look
        more attentively. The details are even more impressive than the
        dazzling general impression. This would be a great place to stop, but
        instead…
      </p>
      <p>
        …in March 2013, dissident right blogger ‘Spandrell’ put up a short
        post on his abrasive but consistently brilliant
        <em>Bloody Shovel</em> site that messed up the narrative in a way that
        has yet to be persuasively addressed. Entitled ‘Et tu, Harry?,’ it
        placed the Singapore miracle in a disconcerting context. Rather than
        harmonizing with neoreactionary celebrations of the city state’s
        unapologetically selective immigration policy, Spandrell asks:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          How many bright Indians and bright Chinese are there, Harry? Surely
          they are not infinite. And what will they do in Singapore? Well,
          engage in the finance and marketing rat-race and depress their
          fertility to 0.78, wasting valuable genes just so your property
          prices don’t go down. Singapore is an IQ shredder.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The accusation is acute, and can be generalized. Modernity has a
        fertility problem. When elevated to the zenith of savage irony, the
        formulation runs: At the demographic level, modernity selects
        systematically against modern populations. The people it prefers, it
        consumes. Without gross exaggeration, this endogenous tendency can be
        seen as an existential risk to the modern world. It threatens to bring
        the entire global order crashing down around it.
      </p>

        In order to discuss this implicit catastrophe, it’s first necessary to
        talk about cities, which is a conversation that has already begun. To
        state the problem crudely, but with confidence: Cities are population
        sinks. Historian William McNeil explains the basics. Urbanization,
        from its origins, has tended relentlessly to convert children from
        productive assets into objects of luxury consumption. All of the
        archaic economic incentives related to fertility are inverted.
      </p>
      <p>
        McNeil summarizes his argument in an online essay considering ‘<a
          href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2007/03/01/cities-and-their-consequences/">Cities and their
          Consequences</a>’:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Intensified exposure to infectious disease was the traditional
          reason why cities did not reproduce themselves. […] But it is the
          cost of raising children in all urban environments, not disease,
          that best explains why urban populations generally decline without
          immigrants from rural areas. Wherever adults go off to work in
          factories, shops and offices, and small children are not allowed to
          accompany them, who looks after the young? How can they be readied
          for gainful employment? Public education and pre-schooling are
          seldom available in urban slums, particularly outside Western
          countries, but occasionally even within them, too. Grandmothers and
          elderly neighbors can sometimes do the job, but extended family
          coherence is not as prevalent in cities, and often such caregivers
          are not available. Professionals of various descriptions must then
          be found. That renders the cost of children’s upkeep high, and the
          nurturing that such professionals usually offer rarely matches their
          large fees. […] Even as children are more expensive in cities, they
          are less economically useful at an early age. There are few berries
          to be picked, no small domesticated animals to herd. There is a much
          longer wait until children can begin to contribute to family income
          in urban settings.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Education expenses alone explain much of this. School fees are by far
        the most effective contraceptive technology ever conceived. To raise a
        child in an urban environment is like nothing that rural precedent
        ever prepared for. Even if <em>responsible parenting</em> were the
        sole motivation in play, the compressive effect on family size would
        be extreme. Under urban circumstances, it becomes almost an aggression
        against one’s own children for there to be many of them. But there is
        much more than this going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognition of the modern fertility crisis and the ‘far right’ –
        whether in its ‘misogynistic’ or its ‘racist’ strains – are not easily
        distinguishable. The egalitarian axiom, as applied to gender or to
        ethnicity, comes under critical strain as the topic is pursued. A
        general theory of the post-conservative right would be productively
        initiated here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feminism has been the first, inevitable target. It is tightly
        correlated with the collapse of fertility, and is something modernity
        tends (strongly) to promote. The expansion of female social
        opportunities beyond obligate child-rearing could scarcely lead
        anywhere other than to a drastic contraction of family size. The
        inexorable modern trend to social decoding – i.e. to the production of
        an abstract contractual agency in the place of concretely determined
        persons – makes the explosion of such opportunities apparently
        uncontainable. The individualism fostered by urban life might, to the
        counter-factual imagination, have been in some way restricted to
        males, but as a matter of actual historical fact the dereliction of
        traditional social roles has proceeded without serious limitation,
        with variation in speed, but no indication of alternative direction.
        The radically decoded Internet persona – optionally anonymous,
        fabricated, and self-defining – seems no more than an extrapolation
        from the emergent norms of urban existence. Feminist assumptions, at
        least in their ‘first-wave,’ liberal form, are integral to the modern
        city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Religious traditionalist lamentations in this regard are, of course,
        nothing new. Christianity – especially under Catholic inspiration –
        has connected modernity to sterility for as long as modernity has been
        noticed. A number of crucial factors have nevertheless changed. Since
        the early years of the new millennium, secular liberals have begun to
        notice the connection between religiosity and fertility, and to
        express gathering concern about its partisan political consequences.
        In a 2009 paper, Sarah R. Hayford and S. Philip Morgan
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723861/">discuss</a>
        the transition from a traditional discussion of the topic, focused
        upon differential Catholic and Protestant fertility, to its
        contemporary mode, subsequent to the convergence of denominational
        differences, and now mapping more closely onto red / blue state
        partisan affiliations. Their abstract is worth citing (almost) in
        full:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), we
          show that women who report that religion is “very important” in
          their everyday life have both higher fertility and higher intended
          fertility than those saying religion is “somewhat important” or “not
          important.” Factors such as unwanted fertility, age at childbearing,
          or degree of fertility postponement seem not to contribute to
          religiosity differentials in fertility. This answer prompts more
          fundamental questions: what is the nature of this greater
          “religiosity”? And why do the more religious want more children? We
          show that those saying religion is more important have more
          traditional gender and family attitudes and that these attitudinal
          differences account for a substantial part of the fertility
          differential.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        “Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?” asked Eric Kaufmann in a 2010
        book with that name. A peculiar twist in the Darwinian inheritance had
        begun to bring the heritability of religious attitudes into
        prominence, and linking it (positively) to the question of
        reproductive fitness. Those groups previously seen as having been
        unambiguously vanquished by a triumphant evolutionary science were now
        subject to an ironic – and from the progressive perspective deeply
        sinister – evolutionary vindication. This is a story that has still
        scarcely begun to unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
        A parallel development, compounding the commitment of cultural
        modernity to imperative sterility, has been the efflorescence of
        LGBTQXYZ sexual identity politics. Following the decisive progressive
        victory in the cause of gay marriage, something like a Cambrian
        Explosion in non-traditional sexual and gender orientations has
        occurred, turbo-charging the pre-existing feminist critique of
        normative reproductive sexuality. Here, too, the affinity with
        profound modernistic inclinations is unmistakable, in a process of
        introjected brand and niche specialization. The tendency – often
        supported as an explicit political strategy – is to invert the terms
        of marginalization, by drowning the reproductive family unit within a
        hyper-inflated menu of socio-libidinal positions. Fertility is
        increasingly identified as a conservative eccentricity, legitimately
        targeted by partisan political warfare. Intense backlash has been
        among the results (providing fertile ground for the post-conciliatory
        ‘far right’).
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, but there’s more. The truly great transition, implicit in the
        process of modernity from the start, is marked by the threshold
        between
        <em>domestic</em> and <em>global</em> urbanization. Major cities have
        always been distinctively cosmopolitan, but for the initial phase of
        their histories the bulk of their demographic absorption has been
        limited to their own ethnic hinterlands. <em>Urbanization</em> meant,
        first of all, the conversion of rural populations into city dwellers.
        In the developing world, it still means this. In the most advanced
        modern societies, however, domestic rural populations were almost
        fully consumed, reduced to some negligible fraction of the national
        total. After this point, the process of population replacement
        intrinsic to the urban phenomenon from its beginning became
        inextricably bound to globalization, and trans-national migration
        flows. Now – which really is <em>now</em> – things get interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Politics</em>, by prophetic etymology, is about cities. The
        inevitability of an emergent ‘Alt-Right’ in the mass politics of
        advanced modern societies is already fully predictable from a minimal
        understanding of how cities work. It is simple delusion to imagine
        that mere contingency rules here, perhaps under the guidance of
        particular political personalities. Rather, the urban metabolism –
        essentially – at a certain phase of its development, generates
        circumstances overwhelmingly conducive to the eruption of popular
        ethno-politics. Cities are demographic parasites. They trend
        intrinsically to a dynamic that – beyond a comparatively definite
        threshold –
        <em>cannot fail to be perceived as a systematic policy of ethnic
          replacement</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is still much hope of coaxing toothpaste back into its tubes. In
        other words, there is a massive failure to appreciate the profundity
        and magnitude of the processes underlying the current global crisis.
        For instance, the incendiary language of migration-driven ‘genocide’
        is not going away. It is bound, on the contrary, to spread, and
        intensify. The re-emergence of the race topic, and all of its
        associates, is deeply baked into the modernist cake. Comparative
        modernity is automatically racialized once global metabolism lends
        differential (urban/rural) fertility its ethnic specificity. What is
        unfolding, among other things, is the racial disaggregation of the
        ‘population bomb,’ with drastic inevitability. This is not a product
        of intellectuals, but of the modern process inherently, and all
        attempts by intellectuals to obstruct its cultural condensation are
        hubristically misconceived. “Who, actually, is having kids?” It is a
        species of insanity to think this question can be strangled in the
        crib.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what’s the answer? Does the Alt-Right have one? If so, there’s
        been no sign of it yet. “Burn the cities to the ground” has been
        floated on Twitter, and no doubt elsewhere, but it doesn’t seem
        obviously practical. That solution has a rich – and especially East
        Asian – communist pedigree, which the Alt-Right will probably
        rediscover at some point. It didn’t work out in the 1970s, and would
        be unlikely to perform any more convincingly today.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the crisis escalates, it can be expected to generate a thread of
        novel political theory oriented to the question:
        <em>How do we make practical and technical sense of social solution
          searches in general?</em>
        Such thinking is going to be necessary. Our great cities pose an
        ultimate political problem. Eventually, something will be grateful for
        that.

        <h4 class="post-title">Time in Transition</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>There has to be a hexagram for this</em></h5>
      <p>
        Isaac Newton’s
        <em>Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em> abstracted time
        from events, establishing its tractability to scientific calculation.
        Conceived as pure, absolute duration, without qualities, it conforms
        perfectly to its mathematical idealization (as the real number line).
        Since time is already pure, its reality indistinguishable from its
        formalization, a pure mathematics of change – the calculus – can be
        applied to physical reality without obstruction. The calculus can
        exactly describe things as they occur in themselves, without straying,
        even infinitesimally, from the rigorous dictates of formal
        intelligence. In this way natural philosophy becomes modern science.
      </p>
      <p>
        (It is perhaps ironic that the Newtonian formulation of
        non-qualitative time coincides with a revolutionary break – or
        qualitative transition – that is perhaps unmatched in history. That,
        however, is a matter for another time.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern science did not end with Newton. Time has since been
        relativized to velocity (Einstein) and punctured with catastrophes
        (Thom). Yet the qualities of time, once evacuated, cannot readily be
        restored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clock technology suffices to tell this story, on its own. Time
        ‘keeping’ devices <em>produce</em> a measure of duration, according to
        general principles of standardized mechanical production, so that a
        clock-marked minute is stripped of qualitative distinctness
        automatically. Chronometrically, any difference between one minute and
        another is a mechanical discrepancy, strictly analogous to a
        production line malfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time modernization culminates in an inversion of definition,
        eventually standardizing from a precisely reproducible building block
        (the atomic second), rather than accommodating itself to a large-scale
        natural cycle – qualified by variations of luminosity – which
        generates sub-units through division. Once the second has becomes
        entirely synthetic, all reference to a qualitative ‘when’ has been
        effaced. All that remains is quantitative comparison, timing, and
        synchronization, as if the time-piece was modeled upon the stop-watch.
        Calendars have become an anachronism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern time intuitions would find plenty of support, even in the
        absence of mechanical chronometry. Every quantifiable trend, from a
        stock movement or an unemployment problem to a demographic pattern or
        an ecological disaster, can be communicated through charts that assume
        a popular facility at graphic intuition, and thus, implicitly, at
        algebraic geometry and even calculus. Time is so widely and easily
        identified with the x-axis of such charts that the principle of
        representation can be left unexplained, however strange this might
        have seemed to pre-moderns. Clearly, if time can be read-off from an
        axis – quickly and intuitively — it is being conceived, generally, as
        if it were a number line (‘Newtonian’).
      </p>
      <p>
        Qualitative time, by now, is a scarcely-accessible exoticism. Nowhere
        is this more obvious that in the case of China’s ancient Classic of
        Change, the <em>Yijing</em>, a work that is today no less hermetic to
        Chinese than it is to foreigners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Yijing</em> is a book of numbers as much as a book on time,
        but its numbers are combinatorial rather than metric, exhausting a
        space of possibilities, and constructing a typology of times. The
        <em>Yijing</em> speaks often of quantities, but it does not measure
        them. Instead, it typologizes them, as processes of increase or
        decrease, rise and fall, lassitude and acceleration, typical of
        qualitative phases of recurrent cycles, with identifiable character
        and reliable practical implication.
      </p>
      <p>The point of all this (just in case you were wondering)?</p>
      <p>
        The current time is a period of transition, with a distinctive
        quality, characterizing the end of an epoch. Something – some age – is
        coming quite rapidly to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a situation that the modern mentality is well-adapted to,
        since it violates certain essential structures of our
        time-consciousness. It eludes our intuitions and our clocks. Our
        charts register it only as a break-down, as they terminate the x-axis
        at a point of senseless infinity (hyperinflation, bubble stock p/e
        ratios, global derivatives exposure, urban intensity, technological
        intelligence explosion) or in a collapse to zero (marginal
        productivity of debt, fiat currency credibility, unit costs of
        self-replicating capital goods). The can clatters off the end of the
        road. Things cannot go on as they have, and they won’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the heated political climate surrounding the impending
        transition of the global economic system, a non-controversial
        diagnosis is almost certainly unobtainable. Niall Ferguson
        <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2011/07/10/ferguson-the-global-temper-tantrum.html"
          target="_blank">describes</a>
        an Age of Global Indignation, or Global Temper Tantrum, in which the
        objectively unsustainable nature of the established order, whilst
        widely if vaguely perceived, still eludes sober recognition. Riots,
        Molotov cocktails, and fabulous conspiracy theorizing are the result.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “What all the Indignant have in common is the refusal to address
          squarely the problem that nearly all Western countries face. That
          problem is that the welfare systems that evolved in the mid-20th
          century are unaffordable under the demographic and economic
          circumstances of the 21st century. The financial crisis has merely
          exacerbated what was already a severe structural crisis of public
          finance, boosting deficits while slowing growth.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In all probability, Ferguson’s blunt analysis will provoke further
        paroxysms of indignation. Yet, as the world’s most pampered societies
        slide ever further into insolvency, such undiplomatic assessments will
        become ever more common, and the rage they inspire will become ever
        more unhinged.

        the senescence and death of Keynesian macroeconomics (drawing on the
        earlier
        <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr321.pdf" target="_blank">work</a>
        of Robert E Lucas and Thomas J Sargent). His research concludes that
        “the Keynsian multiplier for transfer payments or temporary tax
        rebates was not significantly different from zero for the kind of
        stimulus programs enacted in the 2000s.” In other words, stimulus is
        ceasing to stimulate, and gargantuan public debts have been
        accumulated for no rational purpose. This is the ‘debt saturation’
        that Joe Weisenthal
        <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/diminishing-marginal-producitivity-of-debt-2010-3"
          target="_blank">describes</a>
        as “a phase transition with our debt relationship” graphically
        portrayed in “the scariest [chart] of all time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Between financial stimulus and chemical stimulus, there is no
        distinction of practical significance. Keynesianism and cocaine are
        both initially invigorating, before stabilizing into expensive habits
        that steadily lose effectiveness as addiction deepens. By the time
        bankruptcy and mortality beckons, getting off the stimulus seems to be
        near-impossible. Better to crash and burn – or hope that something
        ‘turns up’ — than to suffer the agonies of withdrawal, which will feel
        like hell, and promises nothing more seductive than bare normality at
        the end of a dark road. Character decays into chronic deceit,
        intermittent rage, and maudlin self-pity. Nobody likes a junky, still
        less a junky civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keynesianism was born in deception – the deliberate exploitation of
        ‘money illusion’ for the purposes of economic management. Its effect
        on a political culture is deeply corrosive. Illusionism spreads
        throughout the social body, until the very ideas of hard currency
        (honest money) or balanced budgets (honest spending) are marginalized
        to a ‘crankish’ fringe and being ‘politically realistic’ has become
        synonymous with a more-or-less total denial of reality. To expect a
        Keynesian economic establishment to honestly confront its own failings
        is to laughably misunderstand the syndrome under discussion. A reign
        of lies is structurally incapable of ‘coming clean’ before it goes
        over the cliff (someone needs to do another

        The long Keynesian coke-binge was what the West did with its side of
        globalization, and as it all comes apart — amidst political
        procrastination and furious street protests – a planetary
        <a href="http://www.oftwominds.com/blogjuly11/great-reset6-11.html" target="_blank">reset</a>
        of some kind is inevitable. The ‘<a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/chimerica/"
          target="_blank">Chimerican</a>’ engine of post-colonial globalization requires a fundamental
        overhaul, if not a complete replacement. The immense dynamism of the
        Chimerican Age, as well as its enduring achievements, have depended on
        systematic imbalances that have become patently unsustainable, and it
        is highly unlikely that all the negative consequences will have been
        confined to just one side of the world ledger.

        By then, a half-decade of global stimulus saturation, cascading

        For post-Expo Shanghai, a city stunningly rebuilt in the age of
        Chimerica, the time of transition is a matter of especially acute
        concern. This is a metropolis that waxes and wanes to the pulse of the
        world, rigidly tide-locked to the great surges and recessions of
        globalization. Will the next phase of world history treat it as well
        as the last?

          A Time-Traveler’s Guide to Shanghai (Part 1)
        </h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>When did it all change?</em></h5>
      <p>
        There is a strange, time-fractured moment in the biopic
        <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1239402/" target="_blank">Deng Xiaoping</a></em>
        (2002, directed by Yinnan Ding). For most of its length, the film is
        sober, cautious, and respectful, exemplifying a didactic realism. It
        strictly conforms to the approved story of Deng’s leadership and its
        meaning (exactly as it is found today in the nation’s school
        textbooks). Beginning with Deng’s ascent to power in the ruined China
        of the late-1970s, in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, it follows
        the path of his decision-making, through the restoration
        (de-collectivization) of the rural economy, the re-habilitation of
        persecuted experts and intellectuals, and the beginning of the
        open-door policy, in Shenzhen, to the extension of market-oriented
        reform throughout the country, as symbolized by the opening of
        Shanghai.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst clearly something of a carefully edited and precision-
        manufactured legend, this basic narrative of national regeneration,
        emancipation and growth – salvaged from the ashes of dead-end
        fanaticism and civilizational regression – is honest enough to inform,
        and even to inspire. It leaves no doubt that the ‘meaning’ of Deng
        Xiaoping is openness and renaissance (at least ’70/30′), a judgment
        that is both popularly endorsed in China, and historically attested
        universally.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the movie approaches its conclusion, however, pedestrian realism is
        suddenly supplanted by something entirely different, whether due to
        the ‘deeper’ realism of budgetary constraint, or the ‘higher’ realism
        of artistic serendipity. Deng Xiaoping, from the vantage point of a
        ‘yet’ (in 1992) inexistent bridge, gestures towards Pudong and
        announces the green-light for its developmental liberation. Yet, in
        the background of the scene, the deliriously developed Lujiazui of
        2002 already soars, as if the skyline had been condensed from a
        pre-emptive vision, drawing its substance from the historical
        implication of his words. The future couldn’t wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the speed of Shanghai’s Reform-era urban development has led
        everything to get ahead of itself, disordering the structure of time.
        The Oriental Pearl TV Tower – first architectural statement of the new
        Shanghai and still the most iconic – certainly suggests so.
        Retro-deposited into the Pudong of 1992 by the
        <em>Deng Xiaoping</em> movie, historically completed in 1994,
        symbolically heralding the promised Shanghai of the third millennium,
        architecturally side-stepping into a science fiction fantasy of the
        1950s, alluding to poetic imagery from the Tang Dynasty, and
        containing a museum devoted to the city’s modern history in its
        pedestal, when, exactly, does this structure belong? It’s hard to know
        where to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Emporis
        <a href="http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=103802" target="_blank">profile</a>
        of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower describes its architectural style as
        simply ‘modernism’, which is unobjectionable, but extraordinarily
        under-determining. If the modern defines itself through the present,
        conceived as a break from the past and a projection into the future,
        the Oriental Pearl TV Tower unquestionably installs itself in
        modernity, but only by way of an elaborate path. It reverts to the
        present from a discarded future, whilst excavating an unused future
        from the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buildings that arrive in the present in this way are, strictly
        speaking, ‘fabulous’, and for this reason, they are considered
        disreputable by the dominant traditions of international architecture.
        The fables they feed upon belong to the popular culture of science
        fiction, which makes them over-expressive, vulgarly communicative, and
        rapidly dated. Insofar as their style is recognized generically, it is
        tagged by ugly and dismissive labels such as
        <a href="http://www.spaceagecity.com/googie/" target="_blank">Googie</a>, Populuxe, and Doo-Wop. By reaching out
        too eagerly for the future,
        it is tacitly suggested, one quickly comes to look ridiculous
        (although, today, neomodernists such as Zaha Hadid and Rem Koolhaas
        are recuperating certain elements of this style more sympathetically).
      </p>
      <p>
        Shanghai’s Radisson Hotel, set back from the north of People’s Square,
        is a quintessentially ‘Googie’ structure. It’s space-ship top
        participates exuberantly in a Shanghai tradition of weird
        roof-elaborations, and echoes a formally-comparable — though far
        smaller — classical modern structure to the east, down Nanjing Lu. The
        idea of high-rise rooftops as landing sites for flying vehicles,
        within a dynamic system of three-dimensional traffic, is a staple of
        ultramodernist speculation, whilst an alien arrival from a distant
        future is a transparent Shanghai fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his path-breaking short story
        <em><a href="http://lib.ru/GIBSON/r_contin.txt" target="_blank">The Gernsback Continuum</a></em>, William Gibson
        dubs this style ‘Raygun Gothic’, explicitly marking
        its time-complexity. He thus coaxes it into the wider cultural genre
        of retro-futurism, which applies to everything that evokes an
        out-dated future, and thereby transforms modernity into a
        counter-factual commentary on the present. This genre finds an
        especially rich hunting ground in Shanghai.
      </p>
      <p>
        (This is the first post in a connected series on Shanghai’s
        retro-future, departing from the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. An outline
        examination of retro-futurism itself comes next …)

          A Time-Travelers Guide to Shanghai (Part 2)
        </h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>Dark intimations of the time-rift</em></h5>
      <p>
        Shanghai’s eclectic cityscape explores a variety of modernities
        simultaneously. The sheer scale of the city, exponentiated by its
        relentless dynamism, overflows the time-line.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Shanghai’s early- to mid-20th century high modernist epoch, for
        instance, the city’s consolidating <em>haipai</em> culture was
        distinguished by the absence of a single core. It emerged, instead, as
        the outcome of loosely inter-articulated plural or parallel
        developments, including (but by no means limited to) the urban mores
        of a rising indigenous ‘bourgeoisie’, whose aspirational tributaries
        reached deep into the warrens of the <em>lilongs</em>; the hard
        accelerationism of the International Settlement business culture,
        dominated by near-limitless Shanghailander confidence in the city’s
        global significance and potential; and the left-slanted literary and
        political trends fostered in the coffee shop salons of the French
        Concession, where <em>avant garde</em> ideas cross-pollinated
        promiscuously. This heterogeneous, fertile chaos found its
        architectural echoes in the juxtaposition of building styles,
        quantitatively dominated by Shanghai’s native experiment in urban
        construction (the <em>lilong</em> block), but overawed in patches by
        Western neo-classical colonial edifices; Manhattanite cosmopolitan
        high-rises and Art Deco structures; bold adventures in Chinese modern
        designs (most prominently in Jiangwan); examples of proto-brutalist
        industrial and residential functionalism; and villas in a variety of
        international, hybrid, and advanced styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since re-opening, in the early 1990s, Shanghai has added new
        ingredients to the mix, including its first major examples of
        construction indebted to the austere tenets of the International Style
        (although large rectilinear structures are still, thankfully, a
        rarity); neo-traditional and ethno-exotic kitsch (especially in the
        Old City and the peripheral ‘nine-towns’ respectively); neomodernist
        re-animations of derelicted structures; and ‘Googie’ evocations of
        imagined futures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst the city’s <em>modernization</em> has attained unprecedented
        velocity, however, its native <em>modernism</em> remains comparatively
        retarded. As an urban center in China, Shanghai’s distinctiveness is
        far less marked than it was in the early 20th century. Once occupying
        an overwhelmingly commanding cultural position as the engine-room and
        icon of Chinese modernity, today it participates in a far more
        generalized process of Chinese development. Its internationalism,
        commercial prowess, and technology absorption are no longer obviously
        peerless within China, its domination of the publishing and movie
        industries has passed, its retail giants and innovative advertising
        have surrendered their uniqueness, and its intellectual bohemia is
        matched, or surpassed, in a number of other urban centers. Whilst
        <em>haipai</em> tenuously persists, its dynamism has diffused and its
        confidence attenuated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Shanghai has a specific and coherent urban cultural identity today,
        emerging out of its sprawling multiplicity, and counterbalancing the
        vastly strengthened sense of national identity consolidated since the
        foundation of the PRC, it cannot – like <em>haipai</em> before it – be
        derived from the continuity of the city’s developmental trend, or from
        an urban exceptionalism, feeding on the contrast with a conservative,
        stagnant, or regressive national hinterland. A thoroughly renovated
        Shanghainese culture, or <em>xin</em> <em>haipai</em>, is inextricably
        entangled with the city’s historical discontinuity, or interruption,
        and with a broader Chinese national (or even civilizational)
        modernization that was anticipated by the ‘Old Shanghai’ and revives
        today as a futuristic memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future that had seemed inevitable to the globalizing,
        technophilic, piratical capitalist Shanghai of the 1920s-‘30s
        <em>went missing</em>, as the momentum accumulated over a century of
        accelerating modernization was untracked by aerial destruction,
        invasion, revolution, and agrarian-oriented national integration. As
        the city trod water during the command economy era, the virtual future
        inherent in its ‘Golden Age’ continued to haunt it, surviving
        spectrally as an obscure intuition of urban destiny. Upon re-opening,
        in the early 1990s, this alternative fate flooded back. Under these
        circumstances, futurism is immediately retro-futurism, since urban
        innovation is what was happening before, and invention is bound to a
        process of re-discovery. ‘Renaissance’ always means something of this
        kind (and cannot, of course, be reduced to restoration).
      </p>
      <p>
        This retro-futurist tendency, intrinsic to Shanghai’s revival of urban
        self-consciousness in the new millennium, creates a standing time-loop
        between two epochs of highly-accelerated modernistic advance. As it
        steadily adjusts itself into phase, heritage and development densely
        cross-reference each other, releasing streams of chatter in
        anachronistic, cybergothic codes, such as the deeply encrypted
        ‘language’ of Art Deco. Prophetic traditions inter-mesh with
        commemorative innovations, automatically hunting the point of fusion
        in which they become interchangeable, closing the circuit of time. The
        past was something other than it once seemed, as the present
        demonstrates, and the present is something other than it might seem,
        as the past attests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most accessible examples of Shanghai’s signature time-looping are
        spatially concentrated. At the limit, neo-modern renovation projects
        connect the city’s great waves of modernization within a single
        structure, making a retro-futural theme intrinsic to a current
        development, such as those at
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510051923/http://www.m50.com.cn/en/about_m50.asp"

          target="_blank">Hotel Waterhouse</a>
        (among innumerable cases). Slightly wider and more thematically
        elaborate loops link new buildings to overt exhibitions of modernist
        history. Among the most conspicuous of these are the pairing of the
        Oriental Pearl TV Tower with the Shanghai History Museum (in its
        pedestal), and the Old Shanghai street-life diorama to be found
        beneath the Urban Planning Exhibition Hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such examples can be misleading, however, if they distract from the
        fact that the retro-futurist principle of the new Shanghai culture is
        ambient. From ordinary residential restoration projects, to commercial
        signage, restaurant themes, hotel décor and home furnishings, the
        insistent message is re-emergence, an advance through the past. The
        latest and most stylish thing is typically that which re-attaches
        itself to the city’s modern heritage with maximum intensity. Reaching
        out beyond the city does nothing to break the pattern, because that’s
        precisely what the ‘Old Shanghai’ used to do. Cosmopolitan change is
        its native tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retro-futural couplings can be spatially dispersed. One especially
        prominent time loop lashes together two of the city’s most celebrated
        high-rises – the Park Hotel and the Jin Mao Tower – binding the Puxi
        of Old Shanghai with the Pudong New Area. Each was the tallest
        Shanghai building of its age (judged by highest occupied floor), the
        Park Hotel for five decades, the Jin Mao Tower for just nine years.
        This discrepancy masks a deeper time-symmetry in the completion dates
        of the two buildings: the Park Hotel seven years prior to the closing
        of the city (with the Japanese occupation of the International
        Settlement in 1941), the Jin Mao Tower seven years after the city’s
        formal re-opening (as the culmination of Deng Xiaoping’s Southern
        Tour, in 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes only a glance (or two) to recognize these buildings as
        non-identical time twins, or mutant clones, communicating with each
        other darkly across the rift, in Art Decode. Reciprocally attracted by
        their structural and tonal resonances, the two buildings extract each
        other from their respective period identities and rush together into
        an alternative, occulted time, obscurely defined through contact with
        an absolute future, now partially recalled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these beautifully sinister buildings are at home in the Yin
        World, comfortable with secrets, and with night. Among the first of
        these secrets, shared in their stylistic communion, is darkness
        itself. Nothing could be further removed from the spirit of Le
        Corbusier’s Radiant City than the brooding opulence of these towers,
        glittering on the edge of an unfathomable nocturnal gulf, as if
        intoxicated by the abyss. They remind us that ‘Art Deco’ is a
        (retrospective) label patched crudely over mystery, that it never had
        a manifesto, or a master plan, and that – due to its inarticulate
        self-organization – it has eluded historical comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the sense, at least in part, of Art Deco’s pact with night and
        darkness. Beneath and beyond all ideologies and centralized schemes,
        the spontaneous culture of high-modernism that climaxed in the
        interbellum period remains deeply encrypted. As the new Shanghai
        excavates the old, it is an enigma that becomes ever more pressing.<br />

          A Time-Travelers Guide to Shanghai (Part 3)

      <h5><em>Dieselpunk with Chinese characteristics</em></h5>
      <p>
        Wikipedia attributes the earliest use of the term ‘<a href="http://pwp.detritus.net/in/1997/rf.html"
          target="_blank">retrofuturism</a>’ to Lloyd John Dunn (in 1983). Together with fellow ‘Tape-beatles’
        John Heck, Ralph Johnson, and Paul Neff, Dunn was editor of the
        ‘submagazine’
        <em><a href="http://psrf.detritus.net/volume/5/p28.html" target="_blank">Retrofuturism</a></em>, which ran
        across the bottom of the pages of
        <em>Photostatic</em> magazine over the period 1988-93. The agenda of
        the Tape-beatles was artistic, and retrofurism was “defined as the act
        or tendency of an artist to progress by moving backwards,” testing the
        boundaries between copying and creativity through systematic
        plagiarism and experimental engagement with the technologies of
        reproduction. Whatever the achievements of this ‘original’
        retrofuturist movement, they were soon outgrown by the term itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more recent and comparatively mainstream understanding of
        retro-futurism is represented by the websites of
        <a href="http://www.paleofuture.com/" target="_blank">Matt Novak</a>
        (from 2007) and
        <a href="http://www.retrofuture.com/" target="_blank">Eric Lefcowitz</a>
        (from 2009), devoted to a cultural history of the future. Specializing
        in a comedy of disillusionment (thoroughly spiced with nerd kitsch),
        these sites explore the humorous incongruity between the present as
        once imagined and its actual realization. Content is dominated by the
        rich legacy of failed predictions that has accumulated over a century
        (or more) of science fiction, futurology, and popular expectations of
        progress, covering topics from space colonization, undersea cities,
        extravagant urban designs, advanced transportation systems, humanoid
        domestic robots, and ray-guns, to jumpsuit clothing and meal pills.
        This genre of retro-futurism is near-perfectly epitomized by Daniel H.
        Wilson’s 2007
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wheres-My-Jetpack-Amazing-Science/dp/1596911360" target="_blank">book</a>
        <em>Where’s My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future
          that Never Arrived</em>. The sentiment of the genre is highly consistent and quite readily
        summarized: disappointment with the underperformance of the present is
        redeemed by amusement at the extravagant – even absurd — promise of
        the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retro-futurism in the missing jetpack mode can have broad historical
        horizons. It is only limited by the existence of adequately-specified
        predictions, optimally of the concrete, technologically-defined kind
        most suited to parodic recollection. Matt Novak’s paleofuture or “past
        visions of the future” index spans 130 years (from the 1870s through
        to the 1990s). Nevertheless, the essential characteristics of the
        genre disproportionately attract it to the ‘Golden Age’ of (American)
        science fiction, centered on the 1940s-50s, when technological
        optimism reached its apogee.

        Dated back to the July 1939 issue of pulp SF magazine
        <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em> (edited by John W. Campbell and
        containing stories by Isaac Asimov and A.E. Van Vogt), or to the April
        1939 opening of the dizzily futurist New York World Fair, the Golden
        Age might have been pre-programmed for retro-futurist ridicule. Its
        optimism was entirely lacking in self-doubt; its imagination was
        graphically clarified by the emerging marking tools of modern
        advertising, PR, and global ideological politics; its favored gadgetry
        was lusciously visualized, large-scaled, and anthropomorphically
        meaningful; and an emerging consumer culture, of previously
        unconceived scale and sophistication, served both to package the
        future into a series of discrete, tangible products, and to promote
        aspirations of individual (or nuclear family)
        empowerment-through-consumption that would later be targeted for
        derision. Implausibly marrying social conservatism to
        techno-consumerist utopianism,
        <em>every family with its own flying car</em> is a vision that, from
        the start, hurtles towards retro-futurist hilarity. By the time
        <em>The Jetsons</em> first aired in 1962, the Golden Age had ended,
        and the laughter had begun.

        If William Gibson’s <em>The Gernsback Continuum</em> (1981) antedated
        the term ‘retro-futurism’, it indisputably consolidated the concept,
        investing it with a cultural potential that far exceeded anything the
        light-hearted sallies of the oughties would match. Instead of picking
        among the detritus of Golden Age speculation for objects of amused
        condescension, Gibson back-tracks its themes to the ‘Raygun Gothic’ or
        ‘American Streamlined Modern’ of the interbellum period, and then
        projects this derelicted culture forwards, as a continuous alternative
        history (dominated by quasi-fascist utopianism). The Gernsback
        Continuum is no mere collection of oddities, but rather
        <em>a path not taken</em>, and one that continued to haunt the science
        fiction imagination. Cyberpunk would be its exorcism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hugo Gernsback (1884-1967), commemorated by the ‘Hugo’ science fiction
        awards, was a futuristic fiction enthusiast and (shady) publishing
        entrepreneur who, more than any other identifiable individual,
        catalyzed the emergence of science fiction as a self-conscious genre,
        promoted through cheaply-printed, luridly popular ‘pulp’ magazines. In
        the first issue of <em>Amazing Stories</em>, which he founded in 1926,
        Gernsback defined ‘scientifiction’ as “charming romance intermingled
        with scientific fact and prophetic vision.” Whilst commonly detested
        by his abused writers, due to his sharp business practices,
        Gernsback’s politics seem to have been unremarkable. The ominous Aryan
        technocracy portrayed in <em>The Gernsback Continuum</em> probably
        owes more to the reputation of his successor at
        <em>Amazing Stories</em>, John W. Campbell (1910-1971), and the
        broader cultural tendencies he represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The re- (or pre-) direction of retro-futurism, from abandoned dreams
        to alternative histories, triggered a cascade of avalanches. Often,
        these have been marked by the wanderings of the ‘-punk’ suffix.
        Initially indicative of an anti-utopian (if not necessarily positively
        dystopian) impulse, whose ‘dirty’ futurism embraces social and
        psychological disorder, chaotic causality, uneven development, and
        collapsed horizons, it increasingly adopted an additional, and
        previously unpredictable sense. The history of science fiction – and
        perhaps history more broadly – was ‘punked’ by the emergence of
        literary and cultural sub-genres that carried it down lines of
        unrealized potential. Cyberpunk belonged recognizably to our
        electronically re-engineered time-line, but steampunk, clockpunk,
        <a href="http://www.dieselpunks.org/" target="_blank">dieselpunk</a>
        (or ‘decopunk’), and atompunk – to list them in rough order of their
        appearance — extrapolated techno-social systems that had already been
        bypassed. If these were ‘futures’ at all, they lay not up ahead, but
        along branch-tracks, off to the side.
      </p>
      <p>
        These various ‘retro-punk’ micro-genres could be understood in
        numerous ways. When conceived primarily as literature, they can be
        envisaged as re-animations of period features from the history of
        science fiction, or, more incisively, as liberations of dated futures
        from the dominion of subsequent time. For instance, the Victorian
        future of the steampunks was more than just a hazily anticipated
        Edwardian present, it was something else entirely, propelled in part
        by the real but unactualized potential of mechanical computation (as
        concretized in the Difference and Analytical Engines of Babbage and
        Lovelace).
      </p>
      <p>
        Apprehended more theoretically, retro-punk genres echo significant
        debates. In particular, axial arguments on both the left and the right
        melt into discussions of
        <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5487/A-Case-for-Alternative-History" target="_blank">alternative history</a>,
        especially in the dieselpunk dark-heartland of the 1920s-‘30s. For
        over half a century, European Marxism has been inextricable from
        counter-factual explorations of the Soviet experience, focused on the
        period of maximum <em>Proletkult</em> innovation between the end of
        the post-civil war and the social realist clampdown presaging the
        Stalinist regime. The figure of Leon Trotsky as alternative history
        (dieselpunk) socialist hero makes no sense in any other context. On
        the right, American conservatism has become ever more focused on
        counter-factual interrogation of the Hoover/FDR-Keynesian response to
        the Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, understood as
        the moment when republican <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism was
        supplanted by New Deal social democracy (Coolidge / Mellon ’28
        tee-shirts might still be thin on the ground, but their day might
        come).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst Shanghai is uploading itself into a cyberpunk tomorrow as fast
        as any city on earth, it has few obvious time-gates opening into
        clockpunk, atompunk, or (more disputably) steampunk futures. With
        dieselpunk, however, this series of dismissals grinds immediately to a
        halt. If some crazed dieselpunk demigod had leased the world to use as
        a laboratory, the outcome would have been – to a tolerable degree of
        approximation – indistinguishable from Shanghai.
        <em>Xin haipai</em> is dieselpunk with Chinese characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shanghai’s greatest dieselpunk counter-factual is inescapably: what if
        Japanese invasion had not interrupted the city’s high-modernity in
        1937? What was the city turning into? Beneath that enveloping
        question, however, and further back, a teeming mass of alternatives
        clamor for attention. What if the White Terror of 1927 had not crushed
        the urban workers’ movement? What if the CCP had succeeded, as Song
        Qingling dreamed, of transforming China’s republican government from
        within? What if the international politics of silver had not combined
        with Guomindang kleptocracy to destroy the independent financial
        system? What if Du Yuesheng had extended his ambitions into national
        politics? What if the city’s de-colonization had proceeded under
        peace-time conditions? What if the subsequent social and economic
        evolution of Hong Kong had been able to occur where it was germinated,
        in Shanghai?
      </p>
      <p>
        The 90th anniversary of the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party
        was an occasion for the whole country to lose itself in the dark
        raptures of Shanghai dieselpunk. It was time to return to the 1920s,
        to revisit history as an adventure in contingency, before
        long-established actualities had been sifted from the intensity of raw
        potential, and to re-animate the indeterminism implicit in dramatic
        tension. It is improbable that the celebratory
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699513/" target="_blank">movie</a>
        devoted to the establishment of the CCP,
        <em>Beginning of the Great Revival</em>, was deliberately formulated
        in the dieselpunk genre, but the nation’s microbloggers recognized it
        for what it was, and swarmed the opportunity presented by this
        re-opening of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thickening of cyberspace transforms history into a playground of
        potentials, where things can be re-loaded, and tried in different
        ways. Electronic infrastructures spread and sophisticate, running
        actualities as multiple and variable scenarios, with increasing
        intolerance for rigid outcomes or frozen legacies. As the dominion of
        settled actuality is eroded by currents of experimentation, the past
        re-animates. Nothing is ever over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game Shanghai plays, or the story it tells, is endlessly
        re-started in the dieselpunk cityscape of the 1920s and ‘30s, where
        everything that anybody could want exists in dense, unexpressed
        potentiality — global fortunes, gangster territories, proletarian
        uprisings, revolutionary discoveries, literary glory, sensory
        intoxication, as well as every permutation of modest urbanite
        thriving. It is a city where anything can happen, and somewhere, at
        some time, everything does.

        <h4 class="post-title">Calendric Dominion</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>How hegemony still counts</em></h5>
      <p>
        Modernity and hegemony are <em>Urban Future</em> obsessions, which
        might (at least in part) excuse a link to
        <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2041265/BBC-turns-year-Our-Lord-2-000-years-Christianity-jettisoned-politically-correct-Common-Era.html#ixzz1ZPbIRDgA"
          rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a>
        article in Britain’s <em>Daily Mail</em>, on the topic of
        Christianity, the calendar, and political correctness. It addresses
        itself to the international dominion of the Gregorian, Western
        Christian calendar, and the sensitivities of those who, whilst perhaps
        reconciled to the inevitability of counting in Jesus-years, remain
        determined to dis-evangelize the accompanying acronymics. More
        particularly, it focuses upon the BBC, and its attempt to sensitize on
        other people’s behalf (pass the popcorn).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The BBC’s religious and ethics department says the changes are
            necessary to avoid offending non-Christians.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It states: ‘As the BBC is committed to impartiality it is
            appropriate that we use terms that do not offend or alienate
            non-Christians.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In line with modern practice, BCE/CE (Before Common Era/Common
            Era) are used as a religiously neutral alternative to BC/AD.’</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>But the move has angered Christians …</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>Ann Widdecombe, the Catholic former Tory Minister, said</em>:<em>
            ‘I think what the BBC is doing is offensive to Christians. They
            are discarding terms that have been around for centuries and are
            well understood by everyone.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>‘What are they going to do next? Get rid of the entire calendar
            on the basis that it has its roots in Christianity?’</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It’s an interesting question, and the attempt to hold it open, as
        provocatively as possible, might be the best reason to avoid glib,
        politically correct remedies to the ‘problem’, however that is
        understood. <em>Anno Domini</em> reminds us of dominion, which is a
        far better guideline into historical reality than
        <em>kumbaya</em> gestures towards a ‘Common Era’, as if hegemony had
        no content beyond togetherness. Since dominion has not been achieved
        primarily by impoliteness or insensitivity, politically correct
        multiculturalism is an irrelevant (and dishonest) response to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of whether Jesus is your Lord, or not, the Christian
        calendar dominates, or at least predominates, and the traditional
        acronymic accurately registers that fact. <em>AD bitchez</em>, as the
        commentators of
        <em><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zerohedge</a></em>
        might say.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an intriguing and ineluctable paradox of globalized modernity
        that its approximation to universality remains fundamentally
        structured by ethno-geographical peculiarities of a distinctly
        pre-modern type. The world was not integrated by togetherness, but by
        a succession of particular powers, with their characteristic traits,
        legacies, and parochialisms. For better or for worse, these
        <em>peculiar</em> features have been deeply installed in the governing
        order of the world. Their signs should be meticulously conserved and
        studied rather than clumsily effaced, because they are critical clues
        to the real nature of fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without exception, calendars are treasure troves of
        intricately-sedimented ethno-historical information. They attempt to
        solve an ultimately insoluble problem, by arithmetically rationalizing
        irrational astronomical quantities, most obviously the incommensurable
        cycles of the terrestrial orbit (solar year), lunar orbit (month), and
        terrestrial rotation (day). No coherent arithmetical construct can
        ever reconcile these periods, and even a repulsively inelegant
        calendar can only do so to a tolerable margin or error. The consequent
        ramshackle compromise, typically deformed by a torturous series of
        adjustments, reshufflings, and intercalations, tells an elaborate
        story of fixed and variable cultural priorities, regime changes,
        legacy constraints, alien influences, conceptual capabilities, and
        observational refinements, further complicated by processes of drift,
        adoption, and innovation that ripple through numerical and linguistic
        signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hegemonic (Gregorian) calendar, for instance, is a jagged
        time-crash of incommensurable periods, in which multiple varieties of
        disunity jostle together. Weeks don’t fit into solar and lunar months,
        or years, but cut through them quasi-randomly, so that days and dates
        slide drunkenly across each other. The length of the week is biblical,
        but the names of the days combine ancient astrology (Saturday-Monday)
        with the gods of Norse mythology (Tuesday-Friday). Although the
        Nordic-linguistic aspect of the week has not been strongly globalized,
        its Judaeo-numerical aspect has. The months are a ghastly mess,
        awkwardly mismatched with each other, with the lunar cycle, and with
        the succession of weeks, and testifying to the confused, erratic
        astro-politics of the Roman Empire in their linguistic mixture of
        deities (January, March, April?, May, June), festivals (February),
        emperors (July, August), and numbers (September-December). There is no
        need to excavate into this luxuriant dung-hill here, except to note
        that the ‘Christianity’ of the Western calendar rests upon
        chaos-rotted pagan and poly-numeric foundations.
      </p>
      <p>
        What matters to the AD-BC (vs CE-BCE) debate is not the
        multitudinously-muttering inner disorder of the Western calendar, but
        its estimation of the years, or ‘era’. In this regard, it has clear
        competitors, and thus arouses definite resentments, since its closest
        cousins assert eras of their own. The era of the Hebrew calendar dates
        back to the <em>tohu</em> (chaos) of the year before creation, and
        records the years of the world (Latinized as Anno Mundi), to the
        present 5772 AM. The Islamic calendar, which begins from the Hejira of
        Mohammed, from Mecca to Medina, reached 1432 AH in AD 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Christian calendar, first systematized in AD 525 by Dionysius
        Exiguus (Dennis the Runt), counts the first
        <em>Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi</em> as the birth year of Jesus
        Ben Joseph, a false messiah to the Jews, the Christ and Redeemer for
        the Christians, a prophet to the Moslems, the Nazarene oppressor to
        Satanists, and something else, or nothing much, to everybody else.
        Regardless of the accuracy of its chronology or tacit theology,
        however, this is the year count that has been globally inherited from
        the real process of modernity, and recognized as a world standard by
        the United Nations, among other international organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to the Abrahamic calendars, those of Asia’s demographic
        giants generally lacked tight doctrinal and didactic focus. India can
        usually be relied upon to inundate any topic whatsoever in delirious
        multiplicity, and the calendar is no exception. Bengali, Malayalam,
        and Tamil calendars are all widely used in their respective regions,
        the Indian National Calendar counts from AD 78 = 0, which, in ominous
        keeping with current events, places us in 1933, and the most widely
        accepted Hindu religious calendar total the years since the birth of
        Krishna, reaching 5112 in AD 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fabulous complexity of China’s traditional calendar makes it a
        paradise for
        <a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nerds</a>. Most
        commonly, it counts the years of each imperial reign, and is
        thus integrated by a literary narrative of dynastic history, rather
        than an arithmetical continuum. (The obstacle this presented to
        modernistic universalization is brutally obvious.) Alternatively,
        however, it groups historical time into sixty-year cycles, beginning
        from 2637 BC (which places us in the 28th year of cycle-78). Most
        Chinese today seem to have an extremely tenuous connection to this
        dimension of their calendrical heritage, which scarcely survives
        outside academic departments of ancient history, and in Daoist
        temples. Whilst the internal structure of the traditional year
        survives undamaged, as attested by the annual cycle of festivities,
        Chinese surrender to the Gregorian <em>year count</em> seems absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian conservatives are surely right to argue that it is the year
        count – the number and the era – that matters. The acronyms are merely
        explanatory, and even essentially tautological. Once it has been
        decided that history is measured from and divided by the birth of
        Jesus, it is far too late to quibble over the attribution of
        dominance.
        <em>AD bitchez</em>. That argument is over.<br />

        <h4 class="post-title">Calendric Dominion (Part 2)</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>Caesar with the soul of Christ</em></h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/calendric-dominion/">Political Correctness</a>
        has tacitly legislated against the still-prevailing acronyms that
        define the hegemonic international calendar (BC-AD), and proposed
        clear alternatives (BCE-CE). Both the criticism and the suggestion are
        entirely consistent with its principles. In accordance with the tenets
        of multiculturalism (a more recent and also more active hegemony), it
        extends the liberal assumption of formal equality from individuals to
        ‘cultures’, allocating group rights, and identifying – whilst
        immediately denouncing – discrimination and privilege. As might be
        expected from an ideology that is exceptionally concentrated among
        intellectual elites, the proposed remedy is purely symbolic, taking
        the form of a rectification of signs. The ‘problem’ is diagnosed as a
        failure of consciousness, or sensitivity, requiring only a raising of
        awareness (to be effected, one can safely assume, by properly
        credentialed and compensated professionals).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even considered in its own terms, however, the rectification that is
        suggested amounts to nothing more than an empty <em>gesture</em> of
        refusal, accompanying fundamental compliance. Whilst the symbolic
        ‘left’ draw comfort from the insistence upon inconsequential change,
        with its intrinsic offense against conservative presumptions,
        reinforced by an implied moral critique of tradition, the
        counter-balancing indignation of the ‘right’ fixes the entire dispute
        within the immobilized trenches of the Anglo-American ‘culture war’.
        The deep structure of calendric signs persists unaffected. Between
        Christian dominion (invoking ‘Our Lord’) and a ‘common era’ that is
        obediently framed by the dating of Christian revelation, there is no
        difference that matters. It is the count that counts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Political Correctness fails here in the same way it always does, due
        to its disconnection of ‘correctness’ from any rigorous principle of
        calculation, and its disengagement of ‘sensitivity’ from realistic
        perception. A calendar is a profound cultural edifice, orchestrating
        the apprehension of historical time. As such, it is invulnerable to
        the gnat-bites of ideological irritability (and dominance is not
        reducible to impoliteness).
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem of Western Calendric Dominion is not one of supremacism
        (etiquette) but of supremacy (historical fatality). It might be posed:
        <em>How did modernistic globalization come to be expressed as Christian
          Oecumenon? </em>In large measure, this is Max Weber’s question, and Walter Russell
        Mead’s, but it overflows the investigations of both, in the direction
        of European and Middle Eastern antiquity. Initial stimulation for this
        inquiry is provided by a strange – even fantastic — coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his notebooks, Friedrich Nietzsche imagined the overman
        (<em>Übermensch</em>) as a “Caesar with the soul of Christ,” a
        chimerical being whose tensions echo those of the Church of Rome,
        Latinized Christian liturgy, and the Western calendar. This hybridity
        is expressed by a multitude of calendric features, following a broad
        division of labor between a Roman structuring of the year (within
        which with superficially-Christianized pagan festivals are scattered
        unsystematically), and a Christian year count, but it also points
        towards a cryptic — even radically unintelligible — plane of fusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Year Zero, which never took place, a mysterious synchronization
        occurred, imperceptibly and unremarked, founding the new theopolitical
        calendric order. For the Christians, who would not assimilate the
        Empire until the reign of Constantine in the early-4th century AD, God
        was incarnated as man, in the embryo of Jesus Christ. Simultaneously,
        in a Rome that was perfectly oblivious to the conception of the
        Messiah, the Julian calendar became operational. Julius Caesar’s
        calendric reform had begun 45 years earlier, following the Years of
        Confusion, but incompetent execution in subsequent decades had
        systematically mis-timed the leap year, intercalating a day every
        three years, rather than every four. The anomalous triennial cycle was
        abandoned and “<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julian_calendar&amp;diff=453458780&amp;oldid=451002508"
          target="_blank">the</a>
        Roman calendar was finally aligned to the Julian calendar in 1 BC
        (with AD 1 the first full year of alignment),” although no special
        significance would be assigned to these years until Dionysius Exiguus
        integrated Christian history in AD 525.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the astounding neglect of this twin event, some additional
        emphasis is appropriate: The Julian calendar, which would persist,
        unmodified, for almost 1,600 years, and which still dominates
        colloquial understanding of the year’s length (at 365.25 days), was
        born – by sheer and outrageous ‘chance’ – at the precise origin of the
        Christian Era, as registered by the Western, and now international,
        numbering of historical time. The year count thus exactly simulates a
        commemoration of the calendar itself – or at least of its prototype –
        even though the birth of this calendar, whether understood in the
        terms of secular reason or divine providence, has
        <em>absolutely no connection</em> to the counted beginning. This is a
        coincidence – which is to say, a destiny perceived without
        comprehension – that neither Roman authority nor Christian revelation
        has been able to account for, even as it surreptitiously shapes
        Western (and then Global) history. As the world’s dominant calendar
        counts the years under what appears to be a particular religious
        inspiration, it refers secretly to its own initiation, alluding to
        mysteries of time that are alien to any faith. That much is simple
        fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the Julian calendar, the Gregorian calendar was determined
        under Christian auspices, or at least formal Christian authority (that
        of Pope Gregory XIII), and promulgated by papal bull in 1582. Yet a
        glance suffices to reveal the continuation of Julian calendric
        dominion, since the Gregorian reform effects transformations that
        remain strictly compliant with the Julian pattern, modified only by
        elementary operations of decimal re-scaling and inversion. Where the
        Julian calendar took four years as its base cyclical unit, the
        Gregorian takes four centuries, and where the Julian adds one leap day
        in four years, the Gregorian leaves one and subtracts three in 400.
        The result was an improved approximation to the tropical year
        (averaging ~365.24219 days), from the Julian 365.25 year, to the
        Gregorian 365.2425, a better than 20-fold reduction in discrepancy
        from an average ~0.00781 days per year (drifting off the seasons by
        one day every 128 years) to ~0.00031 (drifting one day every 3,226
        years).
      </p>
      <p>
        The combination of architectonic fidelity with technical adjustment
        defines conservative reform. It is clearly evident in this case. A
        neo-Julian calendar, structured in its essentials at its origin in AD
        1 minus 1, but technically modified at the margin in the interest of
        improved accuracy, armed the West with the world’s most efficient
        large-scale time-keeping system by the early modern period. In China,
        where the Confucian literati staged competitions to test various
        calendars from around the world against the prediction of eclipses,
        Jesuits equipped with the Gregorian calendar prevailed against all
        alternatives, ensuring the inexorable trend towards Western calendric
        conventions, or, at least, the firm identification of Western methods
        with modernistic efficiency. Given only an edge, in China and
        elsewhere, the dynamics of complex systems took over, as ‘network
        effects’ locked-in the predominant standard, whilst systematically
        marginalizing its competitors. Even though Year Zero was still
        missing, it was, ever increasingly, missing at the same time for
        everyone. “Caeser with the soul of Christ” – the master of Quadrennium
        and eclipse — had installed itself as the implicit meaning of world
        history.

        <h4 class="post-title">Calendric Dominion (Part 3)</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>In Search of Year Zero</em></h5>
      <p>
        A Year Zero signifies a radical re-beginning, making universal claims.
        In modern, especially recent modern times, it is associated above all
        with ultra-modernist visions of total politics, at is maximum point of
        utopian and apocalyptic extremity. The existing order of the world is
        reduced to nothing, from which a new history is initiated,
        fundamentally disconnected from anything that occurred before, and
        morally indebted only to itself. Predictably enough, among
        conservative commentators (in the widest sense), such visions are
        broadly indistinguishable from the corpse-strewn landscapes of social
        catastrophe, haunted by the ghosts of unrealizable dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christianity’s global Calendric Dominion is paradoxical — perhaps even
        ‘dialectical’ — in this regard. It provides the governing model of
        historical rupture and unlimited ecumenical extension, and thus of
        total revolution, whilst at the same time representing the
        conservative order antagonized by modernistic ambition. Its example
        incites the lurch to Year Zero, even as it has no year zero of its
        own. Ultimately, its dialectical provocation tends towards Satanic
        temptation: the promise of Anti-Christian Apocalypse, or absolute news
        to a second power. (“If the Christians could do it, why couldn’t we?”
        Cue body-counts scaling up towards infinity.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This tension exists not only between an established Christian order
        and its pseudo-secular revolutionary after-image, but also within
        Christianity itself, which is split internally by the apparent unity
        and real dissociation of ‘messianic time’. The process of Christian
        calendric consolidation was immensely protracted. A distance of
        greater than half a millennium separated the clear formulation of the
        year count from the moment commemorated, with further centuries
        required to fully integrate historical recording on this basis,
        digesting prior Jewish, Roman, and local date registries, and laying
        the foundation for a universalized Christian articulation of time. By
        the time the revolutionary ‘good news’ had been coherently formalized
        into a recognizable prototype of the hegemonic Western calendar, it
        had undergone a long transition from historical break to established
        tradition, with impeccable conservative credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simultaneously, however, the process of calendric consolidation
        sustained, and even sharpened, the messianic expectation of punctual,
        and truly contemporary rupture, projected forwards as duplication, or
        ‘second coming’ of the initial division. Even if the moment in which
        history had been sundered into two parts — before and after, BC and AD
        — now lay in quite distant antiquity, its example remained urgent, and
        promissory. Messianic hope was thus torn and compacted by an intrinsic
        historical doubling, which stretched it between a vastly
        retrospective, gradually recognized beginning, and a prospect of
        sudden completion, whose credibility was assured by its status as
        repetition. What had been would be again, transforming the AD count
        into a completed sequence that was confirmed in the same way it was
        terminated (through Messianic intervention).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unsurprisingly, the substantial history of Western calendric
        establishment is twinned with the rise of millenarianism, through
        phases that trend to increasingly social-revolutionary forms, and
        eventually make way for self-consciously anti-religious, although
        decidedly eschatological, varieties of modernistic total politics.
        Because whatever has happened must — at least — be possible, the very
        existence of the calendar supports anticipations of absolute
        historical rupture. Its count, simply by beginning, prefigures an end.
        What starts can re-start, or conclude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zero, however, intrudes diagonally. It even introduces a comic aspect,
        since whatever the importance of the Christian revelation to the
        salvation of our souls, it is blatantly obvious that it failed to
        deliver a satisfactory arithmetical notation. For that, Christian
        Europe had to await the arrival of the decimal numerals from India,
        via the Moslem Middle East, and the ensuing revolution of calculation
        and book-keeping that coincided with the Renaissance, along with the
        birth of mercantile capitalism in the city states of northern Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, for anybody seeking a truly modern calendar, the Arrival of
        Zero would mark an excellent occasion for a new year zero (AZ 0?),
        around AD 1500. Although this would plausibly date the origin of
        modernity, the historical imprecision of the event counts against it,
        however. In addition, the assimilation of zero by germinal European
        (and thus global) capitalism was evidently gradual — if comparatively
        rapid — rather than a punctual ‘revolutionary’ transition of the kind
        commerorative calendric zero is optimally appropriate to. (If Year
        Zero is thus barred from the designation of its own world-historic
        operationalization, it is perhaps structurally doomed to
        misapplication and the production of disillusionment.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The conspicuous absence of zero from the Western calendar (count),
        exposed in its abrupt jolt from 1 BC to AD 1, is an intolerable and
        irreparable stigma that brings its world irony to a zenith. In the
        very operation of integrating world history, in preparation for
        planetary modernity, it remarks its own debilitating antiquity and
        particularity, in the most condescending modern sense of the limited
        and the primitive — crude, defective and underdeveloped.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could a moment of self-evident calculative incompetence provide a
        convincing origin-point for subsequent historical calculation? Year
        Zero escaped all possibility of conceptual apprehension at the moment
        in the time-count where it is now seen to belong, and infinity (the
        reciprocal of zero) proves no less elusive. Infinity was inserted into
        a time when (and place where) it demonstrably made no sense, and the
        extraordinary world-historical impression that it made did nothing —
        not even nothing– to change that situation. Is this not a worthy
        puzzle for theologians? Omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, yet
        hopeless at maths — these are not the characteristics of a revelation
        designed to impress technologists or accountants. All the more reason,
        then, to take this comedy seriously, in all its ambivalence — since
        the emerging world of technologists and accountants, the
        techno-commercial (runway-industrial, or capitalist) world that would
        globalize the earth, was weaned within the playpen of this calendar,
        and no other. Modernity had selected to date itself in a way that its
        own kindergarten students would scorn.

        <h4 class="post-title">Calendric Dominion (Part 4)</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>A Digression into the Reality Principle</em></h5>
      <p>
        Between the world we would like to inhabit, and the world that exists,
        there’s a gap that tests us. Even the simplest description of this gap
        already calls for a decision. ‘Ideologies’ in the broadest, and
        culturally almost all-consuming sense, serve primarily to soften it.
        Sense, and even compassion, is attributed to the side of reality,
        promising ultimate reconciliation between human hopes and desires and
        the ‘objective’ nature of things. Science, a typically despised and
        misanthropic discipline, tends to the opposite assumption, emphasizing
        the harsh indifference of reality to human interests and expectations,
        with the implication that the lessons it teaches us can be
        administered with unlimited brutality. We can dash ourselves against
        reality if we insist, but we cannot realistically anticipate some
        merciful moderation of the consequences. Nature does not scold or
        punish, it merely breaks us, coldly, upon the rack of our untruths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like other cultural institutions, calendars are saturated with
        ideologies, and tested to destruction against implacable reality.
        Their collision with nature is especially informative, because they
        express obstinate human desires as favored numbers (selected from
        among small positive integers), and they register the gulf of the real
        in a strictly quantitative form. Any surviving calendar relates the
        story of an adaptation to reality, or cultural deference to (and
        deformation by) nature, as numerical preferences have been compromised
        through their encounter with quantitative facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pure ideology in the calendrical sphere is represented in its
        perfection by the fantasy year of the ancient Mesopotamians, 360 days
        in length, and harmonized to the sexagesimal (modulus-60) arithmetic
        of the Sumerians. Its influence has persisted in the 360 degrees of
        the geometric circle, and in the related sexagesimal division into
        minutes and seconds (of time and arc). The archaic calendars of
        Meso-America and East Asia, as well as those of the Middle East, seem
        to have been attracted to the 360-day year, as though to an ideal
        model. If the Great Architect of the Universe had been an
        anthropomorphic geometer, this is the calendar that would work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it doesn’t (with all due respect to the engrossing Biblical
        counter-argument outlined
        <a href="http://www.360calendar.com/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>). Instead, in the mainstream world
        calendric tradition – as
        determined by the eventual global outcome – a first level adaptation
        systematized the year at 365 days – the Egyptian year. Unlike the
        360-day archetypal year, which has all of the first three primes as
        factors, and thus divides conveniently into ‘months’ or other
        component periods, the 365-day year represents a reluctant concession
        to quantitative fact. The number 365 has only two factors (both
        primes, 5 and 73), but neither seems to have acquired any discernible
        calendrical valency, perhaps because of their obvious unsuitability to
        even approximate description of lunar periods. The Egyptians turned
        instead to an awkward but influential innovation: the intercalation. A
        five-day appendix was added to the year, as a sheer correction or
        supplementary commensuration, and an annual reminder of the gap
        between numerical elegance and astronomical reality. Whilst
        intercalations were invested with mytho-religious significance, this
        was essentially compensatory – a crudely obscured testament to the
        weakness of ideality (and thus of systematic priest-craft as a mode of
        reality apprehension, or efficient social purpose). If intercalations
        were necessary, then nature was not spell-bound, and the
        priest-masters of calendric time were exposed, tacitly, as purveyors
        of mystification, whose limits were drawn by the horizon of social
        credulity. Astronomical time mocked the meanings of men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the real (‘tropical’) year discredits its calendrical
        idealizations by unmooring dates from the seasons, in a process of
        time drift that exposes discrepancy, and drives calendar reform.
        Inaccurate calendars are gradually rendered meaningless, as the
        seasonal associations of its time terms are eroded to utter randomness
        – by frigid ‘summer’ months and scorching ‘winter’ ones. Clearly, no
        priesthood can survive in a climate that derides the established order
        of the year, and in which farmers that listen to the holy words (of
        time) are assured inevitable starvation. Unless tracked within a
        tolerable margin of accuracy by a calendar that ‘keeps’ the time, the
        year reverts to an alien and unintelligible thing, entirely exterior
        to cultural comprehension, whilst society’s reigning symbols appear as
        a risible, senseless babble, drowned out by the howling chaos of the
        real.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the introduction of the Julian Calendar, coinciding with the
        (non-event) of year zero, comes the recognition that the tropical year
        is incommensurable with any integer, and that a larger cycle of
        intercalation is required to track it. A kind of modernity, or
        structural demystification, is born with the relinquishment of the
        ideal year, and everything it symbolizes in terms of cosmic design or
        celestial harmony. The devil’s appendix is attached, irremovably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Numeracy and time measurement divorce at the origin of caesarean
        Calendric Dominion, but it is easy to mistake accidents on this path
        for essential concessions to reality. Even allowing for the
        inescapable function of intercalations, there was nothing inevitable –
        at least absolutely or cosmically inevitable – about the utter
        ruination of numerical coherence that the Julian Calendar incarnated,
        and passed on.
      </p>
      <p>
        To explore this (admittedly arcane) topic further requires a
        digression to the second power, into the relations between numbers and
        anthropomorphic desire. The obvious starting point is the 360-day
        calendar of ancient Sumer, and the question: What made this number
        appealing? Whether examining 360, or its sexagesimal root (60), an
        arithmetically-conventional attention to prime factors (2, 3, and 5),
        is initially misleading — although ultimately indispensable. A more
        illuminating introduction begins with the compound factors 10 and 12,
        the latter relevant primarily to the lunar cycle (and the archaic
        dream of an astronomically – or rather astrologically — consistent
        12-month year), and the former reflecting the primordial
        anthropomorphism in matters numeric: decimalism. The 360-day calendar
        is an object of human desire because it is an anthropo-lunar (or
        menstrual-lycanthropic?) hybrid, speaking intrinsically to the cycles
        of human fertility, and to the ‘digital’ patterns instantiated in
        mammalian body-plans. A 360-day year would be <em>ours</em> (even if
        alien things are hidden in it).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthropomorphic decimalism suggests how certain numerical
        opportunities went missing, along with zero. ‘Apprehension’ and
        ‘comprehension’ refer understanding to the prehensile organs of a
        specific organism, whose bilateral symmetry combines five-fingered
        hands to produce a count reaching ten, across an interval that belongs
        to an alien, intractable, third. Triadic beings are monsters, and
        decimally <em>ungraspable</em>. The bino-decimal structure of the
        <em>Yi Jing</em>
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/reign-of-the-tripod/">exhibits</a>
        this with total clarity, through its six-stage time-cycle that counts
        in the recurrent sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5 … Each power of three
        (within the decimal numerals) is expelled along with zero from the
        order of apprehensible time. There is no way that a ternary calendric
        numeracy could ever have been anthropomorphically acceptable – the
        very thought is (almost definitionally) <em>abominable</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet astronomy seems hideously complicit with abomination, at least, if
        the years are twinned. The sixth power of three (3^6) approximates to
        the length of two tropical years with a discrepancy of just ~1.48438
        days, or less than one day a year. An intercalation of three days
        every four years (or two twin-year cycles) brings it to the accuracy
        of the Julian Calendar, and a reduction of this intercalation by one
        day every 128 years (or 64 (2^6) twin-year cycles) exceeds the
        accuracy of the Gregorian calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be necessary to be slightly unbalanced to fully appreciate
        this extraordinary conjunction of numerical elegance and astronomical
        fact. A system of calendric computation that counts only in twos and
        threes, and which maintains a perfectly triadic order of time-division
        up to the duration of a two-year period, is able to quite easily
        exceed the performance of the dominant international calendar
        (reaching a level of accuracy that disappears into the inherent
        instability of the tropical year, and is thus strictly speaking
        unimprovable).
      </p>
      <p>
        How many days are there in a year? ((3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3) / 2) +

      <h5><em>From Crimson Paradise to Soft Apocalypse</em></h5>
      <p>
        Despite its modernity and decimalism, the French
        <em>calendrier républicain</em> or <em>révolutionnaire</em> had no
        Year Zero, but it re-set the terms of understanding. A topic that had
        been conceived as an intersection of religious commemoration with
        astronomical fact became overtly ideological, and dominated by
        considerations of secular politics. The new calendar, which replaced
        AD 1792 with the first year of the new ‘Era of Liberty’, lasted for
        less than 14 years. It was formally abolished by Napoléon, effective
        from 1 January 1806 (the day after 10 Nivôse an XIV), although it was
        briefly revived during the Paris Commune (in AD 1871, or
        <em>Année 79 de la République</em>), when the country’s revolutionary
        enthusiasm was momentarily re-ignited.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the left, the calendric re-set meant radical re-foundation, and
        symbolic extirpation of the <em>Ancien Régime</em>. For the right, it
        meant immanentization of the eschaton, and the origination of
        totalitarian terror. Both definitions were confirmed in 1975, when
        Year Zero was finally reached in the killing fields of the Kampuchean
        Khmer Rouge, where over quarter of the country’s population perished
        during efforts to blank-out the social slate and start over. Khmer
        Rouge leader Saloth Sar (better known by his
        <em>nom de guerre </em>Pol Pot) had made ‘Year Zero’ his own forever,
        re-branded as a South-east Asian <em>final solution</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Year Zero was henceforth far too corpse-flavored to retain propaganda
        value, but that does not render the calendric equation 1975 = 0
        insignificant (rather the opposite). Irrespective of its parochialism
        in time and space, corresponding quite strictly to a re-incarnation of
        (xenophobic-suicidal) ‘national socialism’, it defines a meaningful
        epoch, as the high-water mark of utopian overreach, and the
        complementary re-valorization of conservative pragmatism.
        Appropriately enough, Year Zero describes an instant without duration,
        in which the age of utopian time is terminated in exact coincidence
        with its inauguration. The era it opens is characterized, almost
        perfectly, by its renunciation, as fantasy social programming
        extinguishes itself in blood and collapse. The immanent eschaton
        immediately damns itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historical irony makes this excursion purely (sub-) academic, because
        the new era is <em>essentially</em> disinclined to conceive itself as
        such. What begins from this Year Zero is a global culture of
        ideological exhaustion, or of ‘common sense’, acutely sensitive to the
        grinning death’s head hidden in beautiful dreams, and reconciled to
        compromise with the non-ideal. From the perspective of fantastic
        revolutionary expectation, the high-tide of perfectionist vision ebbs
        into disillusionment and tolerable dissatisfaction –
        <em>but at least it doesn’t eat our children</em>. The new era’s
        structural modesty of ambition has no time for a radical re-beginning
        or crimson paradise, even when it is historically defined by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pol Pot’s Year Zero is sandwiched between the publication of Eric
        Voegelin’s <em>The Ecumenic Age</em> (1974), and the first spontaneous
        Chinese mass protests against the Great Proletarian Cultural
        Revolution (over the months following the death of Zhou Enlai, in
        January 1976). It is noteworthy in this regard that Deng Xiaoping
        eulogized Zhou at his memorial ceremony for being “modest and prudent”
        (thus the New Aeon speaks).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Anglo-American world, the politics of ideological exhaustion
        were about to take an explicitly conservative form, positively
        expressed as ‘market realism’ (and in this sense deeply resonant with,
        as well as synchronized to, Chinese developments). Margaret Thatcher
        assumed leadership of the British Conservative Party in February 1975,
        and Ronald Reagan declared his presidential candidacy in November of
        the same year. The English-speaking left would soon be traumatized by
        a paradoxical ‘conservative revolution’ that extracted relentless
        energy from the very constriction of political possibility. What
        <em>could not happen</em> quickly became the primary social dynamo, as
        articulated by the Thatcherite maxim: “There is no alternative” (=
        option zero). The auto-immolation of utopia had transmuted into a new
        beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst the era of not restarting from zero can be dated to approximate
        accuracy (from AD <em>n</em> – 1975), and had thus in fact restarted
        from zero, in profoundly surreptitious fashion, its broad consequence
        was to spread and entrench (Gregorian) Calendric Dominion ever more
        widely and deeply. The prevailing combination of radically innovative
        globalization (both economic and technological) with prudential social
        conservatism made such an outcome inevitable. Symbolic re-commencement
        wasn’t on anybody’s agenda, and even as the postmodernists declared
        the end of ‘grand narratives’, the first planetary-hegemonic narrative
        structure in history was consolidating its position of uncontested
        monopoly. Globalization was the story of the world, with Gregorian
        dating as its grammar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orphaned by ideological exhaustion, stigmatized beyond recovery by its
        association with the Khmer Rouge, and radically maladapted to the
        reigning spirit of incremental pragmatism, by the late 20th century
        Year Zero was seemingly off the agenda, unscheduled, and on its own.
        Time, then, for something truly insidious.

          target="_blank">called</a>
        attention to a disturbing prospect that had driven a friend into
        insomnia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>I have a friend that raised an interesting question that I
            immediately tried to prove wrong. He is a programmer and has this
            notion that when we reach the year 2000, computers will not accept
            the new date. Will the computers assume that it is 1900, or will
            it even cause a problem? I violently opposed this because it
            seemed so meaningless. Computers have entered into existence
            during this century, and has software, specifically accounting
            software, been prepared for this turnover? If this really comes to
            pass and my friend is correct, what will happen? Is it anything to
            be concerned about?</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Bolles’ anonymous friend was losing sleep over what would come to be
        known as the ‘Y2K problem’. In order to economize on memory in
        primitive early-generation computers, a widely-adopted convention
        recorded dates by two digits. The millennium and century were ignored,
        since it was assumed that software upgrades would have made the
        problem moot by the time it became imminent, close to the ‘rollover’
        (of century
        <em>and</em> millennium) in the year AD 2000. Few had anticipated that
        the comparative conservatism of software legacies (relative to
        hardware development) would leave the problem entirely unaddressed
        even as the crisis date approached.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, Y2K was a non-event that counted for nothing, although its
        preparation costs, stimulus effects (especially on outsourcing to the
        emerging Indian software industry), and panic potential were all
        considerable. Its importance to the history of the calendar – whilst
        still almost entirely virtual – is extremely far-reaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Y2K resulted from the accidental — or ‘spontaneous’ — emergence of a
        new calendrical order within the globalized technosphere. Its Year
        Zero, 0K (= 1900), was devoid of all parochial commemoration or
        ideological intention, even as it was propagated through increasingly
        computerized communication channels to a point of ubiquity that
        converged, asymptotically, with that attained by Western Calendric
        Dominion over the complete sweep of world history. The 20th century
        had been recoded, automatically, as the 1st century of the Cybernetic
        Continuum. If Y2K had completed its reformatting of the planetary
        sphere-drive in the way some (few deluded hysterics) had expected, the
        world would now be approaching the end of the year 0K+111, settled
        securely in its first arithmetically-competent universal calendar, and
        historically oriented by the same system of electronic computation
        that had unconsciously decided upon the origin of positive time.
        Instead, the ‘millennium bug’ was fixed, and theological date-counting
        prolonged its dominance, uninterrupted (after much ado about nothing).
        Most probably, the hegemonic cultural complex encrusted in Calendric
        Dominion never even noticed the cybernetic insurrection it had
        crushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between 0K and Y2K, the alpha and omega of soft apocalypse, there is
        not only a century of historical time, but also an inversion of
        attitude. Time departs 0K, as from any point of origin, accumulating
        elapsed duration through its count. Y2K, in contrast, was a
        destination, which time approached, as if to an apocalyptic horizon.
        Whilst not registered as a countdown, it might easily have been. The
        terminus was precisely determined (no less than the origin), and the
        strictest formulation of the millennium bug construed the rollover
        point as an absolute limit to recordable time, beyond which no future
        was even imaginable. For any hypothetical Y2K-constrained computer
        intelligence, denied access to dating procedures that over-spilled its
        two-digit year registry, residual time shrank towards zero as the
        millennium event loomed. Once all the nines are reached, time is
        finished, at the threshold of eternity, where beginning and end are
        indistinguishable (in 0).

        <h4 class="post-title">Calendric Dominion (Part 6)</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>Countdown</em></h5>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the 21st century, global cultural hegemony is on
        the move. For roughly 500 years, Western — and later more specifically
        Anglophone — societies and agencies have predominantly guided the
        development of the current world system. As their economic
        pre-eminence wanes, their cultural and political influence can be
        expected to undergo a comparable decline. In the early stages of the
        coming transition, however, the terminal form of active Western
        cultural hegemony – multicultural political correctness (MPC) – is
        well-positioned to manage the terms of the retreat. By reconfiguring
        basic Western religious and political themes as a systematic
        sensitization to unwarranted privilege, MPC is able to distance itself
        from its own heritage and to live on, in the resentment of ‘the
        other’, as if it were the neutral adjudicator of disputes it had no
        part in.
      </p>
      <p>
        When MPC turns its attention to the Gregorian (or Western Christian)
        Calendar it is, of course, appalled. But it is also stuck. What could
        be more insensitive to cultural diversity than an ecumenical
        date-counting system, rooted in the ethnic peculiarities of
        Greek-phase Abrahamic religion, which unapologetically celebrates its
        triumph in the uncompromising words Anno Domini? Yet global
        convergence demands a standard, no alternative calendar has superior
        claims to neutrality, and, in any case, the inertial juggernaut of
        large-scale complex systems – ‘lock-in’ or ‘path-dependency’ – pose
        barriers to switching that seem effectively insuperable. The solution
        proposed by MPC to this conundrum is so feeble that it amounts to the
        completion of Gregorian Calendric Dominion, which is to be
        simultaneously rephrased (politely) and acknowledged in its
        irresistible universality as the articulation of a ‘Common Era’.
      </p>
      <p>
        MPC supplants problems of cultural power with obfuscatory etiquette,
        and in absolute terms, its smug dishonesty is difficult to like. As a
        relative phenomenon, however, its appeal is more obvious, since
        radical ‘solutions’ to Gregorian Calendric Dominion, re-beginning at
        Year Zero, have generally reverted to mass murder. Lacking persuasive
        claims to a new, fundamental, and universally acknowledged historical
        break, they have substituted terror for true global singularity, as if
        fate could be blotted out in blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since resentment gets nowhere, whether in its mild (MPC) or harsh
        (killing fields) variants, it is worth entertaining alternative
        possibilities. These begin with attention to real cultural
        differences, rather than mere ‘cultural diversity’ as it presents
        itself to the vacuously MPC-processed mind. Soon after Shanghai had
        been selected as host city for World Expo 2010 (in December 2002),
        countdowns started. For Westerners, these probably had space-age
        associations, triggering memories of the countdowns to ‘blast off’
        that were popularized by the Apollo Program, and subsequent science
        fiction media. It is far from impossible that Chinese shared in these
        evocations, although they were also able to access a far deeper –
        which is to say civilizationally fundamental – reservoir of reference.
        That is because Chinese time typically counts down, modeled, as it is,
        on the workings of water clocks. The Chinese language systematically
        describes previous as ‘above’ (<em>shang</em>) and next as ‘beneath’
        (<em>xia</em>), conforming to an intuition of time as descent. Time is
        counted down as it runs out, from an elevated hydraulic body into the
        sunken future that receives it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Duration not only flows, it drips. Perhaps, then, an ‘orientalization’
        of calendric perception and organization is something that
        significantly exceeds a simple (or even exceedingly difficult)
        renegotiation of beginnings. Re-beginning might be considered largely
        irrelevant to the problem, at least when compared to the
        re-orientation from an original to a terminal Year Zero. Whilst not
        exactly a transition in the direction of time, such a change would
        involve a transition in the direction of time intuition,
        simultaneously surpassing the wildest ambitions of calendrical
        re-origination and subtly organizing itself ‘within the pores’ of the
        established order of time. As modeled by the 2010 Expo, and previously
        by Y2K, the switch to countdown time does not frontally challenge, or
        seek to straightforwardly replace, the calendric order in being.
        Rather than counting in the same way, from a different place, it
        counts in a different way, within the framework of time already in
        place. It is a revolution with ‘Chinese characteristics’, which is to
        say: a surreptitious insurgency, changing what something already was,
        rather than replacing it with something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the 2010 Expo and Y2K also reveal the extreme difficulty of any
        such transition, since a futural Year Zero, or countdown calendar,
        must navigate the arrow of time and its cognitive asymmetry (between
        knowledge of the past and of the future), presupposing exact,
        confident, and consensual prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why it approximates so closely to conservative acceptance. If
        the countdown is to be sure of arriving at the scheduled terminus, the
        destination ‘event’ must already be a date (rather than an empirical
        ‘happening’). Nothing will suffice except a strictly arithmetical,
        rigorously certain inevitability, as inescapably pre-destined as the
        year 2000, or 2010, which cannot but come. From the perspective of the
        countdown calendar, that is what (Gregorian) Calendric Dominion will
        have been for. It is an opportunity to program an inevitable arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when? The sheer passage (fall) of time has assured that the
        opportunity for calendric revolution presented by the Y2K ‘millennium
        bug’ has been irretrievably missed (so that AD 1900 ≠ 0). The same is
        true of World Expo 2010, an event without pretense to be anything
        beyond a miniature ‘practice’ model of global-temporal singularity. As
        for the real (techno-commercial) Singularity – that is an imprecise
        historical prediction, at once controversial and incapable of
        supporting exact prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more appropriate prospect is suggested by the science fiction writer
        Greg Bear, in his novel Queen of Angels, set in anticipation of the
        mid-21st century ‘binary millennium’ (2048 = 2¹¹). This is a formally
        suitable, purely calendric ‘event’, deriving its significance from
        arithmetic rather than ideology or uncertain prophecy. He even
        envisages it as a moment of insurgent revolution, when artificial
        intelligence arises surreptitiously, and unnoticed. Yet arbitrariness
        impairs this date (why the 11th power of 2?), and no serious attempt
        is made to explain its rise to exceptional cultural prominence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an adjusted global culture is to converge upon a countdown date, it
        must be obvious, intrinsically compelling, and ideologically
        uncontroversial, in other words, spontaneously plausible. The target
        that World Expo 2010 suggests (anagrammatically) is AD 2100, a date
        that performs the final stages of a countdown (2, 1, 0 …). Reinforcing
        this indication, the Y2K ‘millennium bug’ threatened to re-set the
        date of AD 2000 to AD 1900, which would have tacitly reiterated itself
        at the exact end of the 21st century. If it continues to chatter about
        the calendar, perhaps this is how.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impending Mayan Apocalypse, scheduled for 21 / 12 / 2012, offers a
        preliminary chance to indulge in a festival of countdown numbers –
        like 2010, it looks a lot like another digital singularity simulation.
        If the morning of December 22nd, 2012, leaves the world with nothing
        worse than a hangover, it could gradually settle into a new sense of
        the Years Remaining (to the end of all the time that counts, or the
        21st century).
      </p>
      <p>AD 2100 = 0 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2099 = 1 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2098 = 2 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2096 = 4 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2092 = 8 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2084 = 16 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2068 = 32 YR</p>
      <p>AD 2036 = 64 YR</p>
      <p>AD 1972 = 128 YR</p>
      <p>AD 1844 = 256 YR</p>
      <p>AD 1588 = 512 YR</p>
      <p>AD 1076 = 1024 YR</p>
      <p>AD 52 = 2048 YR</p>
      <p>
        It’s difficult to anticipate what it looks like from the other side.

      </p>
      <p>
        In Rian Johnson’s <em>Looper</em> (2012), the city of Shanghai reaches
        back across 30 years to draw people in. Over these decades it feeds
        itself based on what it is to become: <em>the city of the future</em>.
        When compared to this, everything else that happens in the movie is
        mere distraction, but we won’t get there for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strangely enough, ‘everything else’ was to have been simply
        everything. Joe was going to Paris, and Shanghai wasn’t even in the
        picture. That was before Chinese authorities told Johnson that they
        would cover the cost of the Shanghai shoot, making the film a
        co-production, with convenient access to the Chinese cinema market.
        The Old World stood no chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For American audiences, <em>Looper</em> played into the trend of
        opinion, through its contrasting urban visions of a grim,
        deteriorated, crime-wracked Kansas City and the splendors of a
        ‘futuristic’ Shanghai. The movie doesn’t answer the question:
        <em>How did America lose the future? </em>It nevertheless accepts the
        premise, as something close to a pre-installed fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet if <em>Looper</em> confirmed the direction of American popular
        attitudes, it marked a shift on the Chinese side. Only a few years
        before, Western
        <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/making-tv-safer-chinese-censors-crack-down-on-time-travel/"
          target="_blank">media</a>
        reported with amusement that the Chinese broadcast
        <a href="http://www.sarft.gov.cn/articles/2011/03/31/20110331140820680073.html" target="_blank">authorities</a>
        had banned time-travel fictions from the nation’s airwaves, apparently
        concerned that the country’s citizens were defecting into a
        pre-republican past, under the influence of narratives that “casually
        make up myths, have monstrous and weird plots, use absurd tactics, and
        even promote feudalism, superstition, fatalism and reincarnation.” Now
        a time-travel story was being actively recruited to close an urban
        promotion loop, linking Shanghai’s international image to a portrayal
        of retro-chronic anomaly. The Shanghai time-travel industry had
        arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before proceeding to a multi-installment investigation of
        <del>Topological Meta-History</del> tangled time-circuitry, which
        ‘time-travel’ illustrates only as a crude dramatization, it is worth
        pausing over <em>Looper</em>’s ‘monstrous and weird plot’. Time-travel
        has a uniquely intimate, and seductively morbid, relationship to both
        fiction and history, because it scrambles the very principle of
        narrative order in profundity. If Western media authorities assumed
        the same role of cultural custodianship that has been traditional
        among their Chinese peers, they too might have been compelled to
        denounce a genre that flagrantly subverted the foundational principle
        of Aristotelian poetics: that any story worthy of veneration should
        have a beginning, a middle, and an end. If time-travel can occur, it
        seems (at least initially) that order is an illusion, so that fiction
        and reality switch places.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a conservative perspective, therefore, comfort is to be found in
        the blatant absurdity of time-travel stories (insofar as this can be
        confined to a <em>reductio ad absurdam</em> of the time-loop structure
        itself, rather than spreading outwards as the index of primordial
        cosmic disorder). In this respect, <em>Looper</em> is a model of
        tranquillization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Looper</em> time-travel procedure is monopolized by a criminal
        syndicate, which utilizes it exclusively for one purpose: the disposal
        of awkward individuals, who are returned 30 years in time to be
        murdered, execution-style, by professional killers (<a
          href="http://takimag.com/article/the_scoop_on_looper_steve_sailer/print" target="_blank">yes</a>: “This sounds
        pretty stupid”). The exorbitant absurdity of this
        scenario might exempt it from further critical attention, were it not
        the symptom of more interesting things, and the doorway onto others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symptom first: Non-linear time-structures are shaken to pieces
        almost immediately, once they allow for the transportation of
        <em>stuff</em> backwards in time. <em>Looper</em> economics exposes
        this with particular clarity. The killers of 2044 are paid in bars of
        silver for ‘ordinary’ hits, and in gold for ‘closing loops’ or
        executing their retro-deposited older selves. The bars are sent back
        from 2074, and circulated through an internal exchange operation,
        which swaps bullion for (Chinese) paper currency. Whilst this crude
        time-circuit is presented as a payments system, the process described
        actually functions as an under-performing money-making machine. By
        using it, one realizes the ultimate Austrian economic nightmare by
        <em>printing precious metals</em>, because an ingot sent backwards in
        time is doubled, or added to its ‘previous’ instance (which already
        exists in the past). Mechanical re-iteration of the process would
        guarantee exponential growth for free. We’re not told what the 2074
        criminal organization sees as its core business, but it must be
        seriously lucrative — exciting enough, in any case, to distract them
        from the fact that their murder-fodder machine is really a bullion
        fast-breeder. They could have shoveled it full of diamonds, doubling
        their fortune each ‘time’, but they decided instead to duplicate human
        nuisances in 2044. The movie asks us quietly to suspend our
        impertinent disbelief, and trust that they know what they’re doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mike Dickison’s excellent <em>Looper</em>
        <a href="http://www.giantflightlessbirds.com/2012/10/nine-problems-with-looper-that-arent-brain-melting-time-paradoxes/"
          target="_blank">commentary</a>
        succinctly describes this implicit procedure for unlimited wealth,
        among other incredibly missed opportunities. It surely has to count as
        a criticism of the movie that its rickety framework of plot coherence
        is dependent upon the imbecility of its significant agents, who
        stumble blindly past the prospect of total power in their ruthless
        pursuit of a miserable racket. This absurdity, as already noted,
        serves a conservative purpose: The potential of the loop has to be
        suppressed to sustain narrative drama and intelligibility. The basic
        flaw of the movie is that far too much was given, before most of it
        was clumsily taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of controlling censors, Johnson’s story represses
        itself, messily, comically, and unconvincingly. “This time travel
        crap, just fries your brain like a egg,” the elder Joe (Bruce Willis)
        confesses on Johnson’s behalf. Unleashed time-travel is an anti-plot,
        inconsistent with dramatic presentation. (If you’re not willing to
        take Aristotle’s word for that, watching
        <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/" target="_blank">Primer</a></em>
        a few dozen times should sort you out.) Narrative wreckage is what
        time-travel does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time-travel absurdity is a <em>choice</em>. It is a decision taken, at
        least semi-deliberately, for conservative or protective reasons,
        because the alternative would be ruin. Even the representation of
        (radically nonlinear) time anomaly by ‘time-travel’ is indicative of
        this, since it is programmed by the preservation of a narrative
        function (the ‘time-traveler’), regardless of conceptual expense. Far
        rather the incoherent jumble of matter duplication, time-line
        proliferation, immunized strands of personal memory, and the arbitrary
        inhibition of potentialities, than utter narrative disorder, fate
        loops, the annihilation of agency, and the emergence of an alien
        consistency, subverting all historical meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the mask of time-travel has slipped enough to expose some hint of
        the
        <em>intolerable</em> tangle beneath, we’re ready to take the next step
        …

      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/extropy/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Extropy</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        What greater calamity can a neologism inherit than a
        <a href="http://www.maxmore.com/">techno-hippy</a> paternity? Such a
        fate, apparently, induces even other
        <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/24/my-bright-idea-kevin-kelly">techno-hippies</a>
        to skirt around it (whilst repeating it almost exactly). But it needs
        to be said, whether through gritted teeth or not, that ‘extropy’ is a
        <em>great</em> word, and close to an indispensable one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extropy, or local entropy reduction, is — quite simply — what it is
        for something to work. The entire techno-science of entropy, on its
        practical (cybernetic) side, is nothing but extropy generation. There
        is no rigorous conception of functionality that really bypasses it.
        The closest approximation to objective value that will ever be found
        already has a name, and ‘extropy’ is it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of this term to the investigation of time is brought
        into focus by the
        <a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/eternitytohere/faq.html">work</a>
        of Sean Carroll (although, of course, he never uses it). If the
        directionality or ‘arrow’ of time is understood as Eddington proposed,
        through rising global entropy (or disorder), as anticipated by the
        second law of thermodynamics, local extropy poses an intriguing
        question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carroll’s discussion is directed towards his sense of the ultimate
        temporal and cosmological problem:  the low entropy state of the early
        universe (assumed but not explained by prevailing cosmo-physics).
        Given this intellectual momentum, the problem of local
        negative-entropy production (extropy) is little more than a
        distraction, or a spurious objection to the conceptual scaffolding he
        presents. He comments:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Second Law doesn’t forbid decreases in entropy in
          <strong>open</strong> systems — by putting in the work, you are able
          to tidy up your room, decreasing its entropy but still increasing
          the entropy of the whole universe (you make noise, burn calories,
          etc.). Nor is it in any way incompatible with
          <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo/probability.html">evolution</a>
          or complexity or any such thing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The perplexing question, however, is this: If entropy defines the
        direction of time, with increasing disorder determining the difference
        of the future from the past, doesn’t (local) extropy — through which
        all complex cybernetic beings, such as lifeforms, exist — describe a
        negative temporality, or time-reversal? Is it not in fact more likely,
        given the inevitable embeddedness of intelligence in ‘inverted’ time,
        that it is the cosmological or general conception of time that is
        <em>reversed </em>(from any possible naturally-constructed
        perspective)?
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the conclusion, it is clear that entropy and extropy have
        opposing time-signatures, so that time-reversal is a relatively banal
        cosmological fact. ‘We’ inhabit a bubble of backwards time (whoever we
        are), whilst immersed in a cosmic environment which runs
        overwhelmingly in the opposite direction. If reality is harsh and
        strange, that’s why.

        </a>
        <p>
          There is a ‘problem’ that has been nagging at me for a long time –
          which is that <i>there hasn’t been a long time</i>. It’s Saturday,
          with no one around, or getting drunk, or something, so I’ll run it
          past you. Cosmology seems oddly childish.
        </p>
        <p>
          An analogy might help. Among all the reasons for super-sophisticated
          atheistic materialists to deride Abrahamic creationists, the most
          arithmetically impressive is the whole James Ussher 4004 BC thing.
          The argument is familiar to everyone: <i>6,027 years — Ha!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Creationism is a topic for another time. The point for now is just:
          <i>13.7 billion years – Ha!</i> Perhaps this cosmological consensus
          estimate for the age of the universe is true. I’m certainly not
          going to pit my carefully-rationed expertise in cosmo-physics
          against it. But it’s a <i>stupidly</i> short amount of time. If this
          is reality, the joke’s on us. Between Ussher’s mid-17<sup>th</sup>
          century estimate and (say) Hawking’s late 20<sup>th</sup> century
          one, the difference is just six orders of magnitude. It’s scarcely
          worth getting out of bed for. Or the crib.
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-809"></span></p>
        <p>
          For anyone steeped in Hindu Cosmology – which locates us 1.56 x
          10^14 years into the current Age of Brahma – or Lovecraftian
          metaphysics, with its vaguer but abysmally extended eons, the
          quantity of elapsed cosmic time, according to the common
          understanding of our present scientific establishment, is cause for
          claustrophobia. Looking backward, we are sealed in a small room,
          with the wall of the original singularity pressed right up against
          us. (Looking forward, things are quite different, and we will get to
          that.)
        </p>
        <p>
          There are at least three ways in which the bizarre youthfulness of
          the universe might be imagined:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Consider first the disconcerting lack of proportion between space
          and time. The universe contains roughly 100 billion galaxies, each a
          swirl of 100 billion stars. That makes Sol one of 10^22 stars in the
          cosmos, but it has lasted for something like
          <i>a third of the life of the universe</i>. Decompose the solar
          system and the discrepancy only becomes more extreme. The sun
          accounts for 99.86% of the system’s mass, and the gas giants
          incorporate 99% of the remainder, yet the age of the earth is only
          fractionally less than that of the sun. Earth is
          <i>a cosmic time hog</i>. In space it is next to nothing, but in
          time it extends back through a substantial proportion of the
          Stelliferous Era, so close to the origin of the universe that it is
          belongs to the very earliest generations of planetary bodies. Beyond
          it stretch incomprehensible immensities, but before it there is next
          to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Compared to the intensity of time (backward) extension is of
          vanishing insignificance. The unit of Planck time – corresponding to
          the passage of a photon across a Planck length — is about 5.4 x
          10^-44 seconds. If there is a true <i>instant</i>, that is it. A
          year consists of less the 3.2 x 10^7 seconds, so cosmological
          consensus estimates that there have been approximately 432 339 120
          000 000 000 seconds since the Big Bang, which for our purposes can
          be satisfactorily rounded to 4.3 x 10^17. The difference between a
          second and the age of the universe is smaller that that between a
          second and a Planck Time tick by nearly
          <i>27 orders of magnitude</i>. In other words, if a Planck
          Time-sensitive questioner asked “When did the Big Bang happen?” and
          you answered “Just now” — in clock time — you’d be almost exactly
          right. If you had been asked to identify a particular star from
          among the entire stellar population of the universe, and you picked
          it out correctly, your accuracy would still be hazier by 5 orders of
          magnitude. Quite obviously, there haven’t been enough seconds since
          the Big Bang to add up to a serious number – less than one for every
          10,000 stars in the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Isotropy gets violated by time orientation like a Detroit
          muni-bond investor. In a universe dominated by dark energy – like
          ours – expansion lasts <i>forever</i>. The Stelliferous Era is
          predicted to last for roughly 100 trillion years, which is over
          7,000 times the present age of the universe. Even the most
          pessimistic interpretation of the Anthropic Principle, therefore,
          places us only a fractional distance from the beginning of time. The
          Degenerate Era, post-dating star-formation, then extends out to
          10^40 years, by the end of which time all baryonic matter will have
          decayed, and even the most radically advanced forms of cosmic
          intelligence will have found existence becoming seriously
          challenging. Black holes then dominate out to 10^60 years, after
          which the Dark Era begins, lasting a <i>long</i> time. (Decimal
          exponents become unwieldy for these magnitudes, making more
          elaborate modes of arithmetical notation expedient. We need not
          pursue it further.) The take-away: the principle of Isotropy holds
          that we should not find ourselves anywhere special in the universe,
          and yet we do – right at the beginning. More implausibly still, we
          are located at <i>the very beginning of an infinity</i> (although
          anthropic selection might crop this down to merely preposterous
          improbability).
        </p>
        <p>
          Intuitively, this is all horribly wrong, although intuitions have no
          credible authority, and certainly provide no grounds for contesting
          rigorously assembled scientific narratives.  Possibly — I should
          concede
          <em>most probably</em> — time is simply ridiculous, not to say
          profoundly insulting. We find ourselves glued to the very edge of
          the
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/big-bang-an-appreciation/">Big Bang</a>, as close to neo-natal as it is
          arithmetically possible to be.
        </p>
        <p>That’s odd, isn’t it?</p>

        <p>
          Natural cycles being what they are, there’s bound to be another
          mini-Ice Age (of the Maunder Minimum-type) eventually, and quite
          possibly

          The implications for climate science, climate politics, and much
          beyond, are huge. Clean data on systemic effects are not accessible
          within history. That means all vulgar attempts to read out the
          effects of anthropic interventions from the historical record are
          doomed to fail, until perfect understanding of confounding rhythms
          are fully understood — basically, indefinitely. (Throw in chaos
          theory and other sources of epistemological pessimism here.) No one
          seriously thinks that a globally-coordinated ‘precautionary’ policy
          stance viz anthropogenic warming is constructible during a mini-Ice
          Age (do they?).
        </p>
        <p>
          The consequence: Climate politics could — in reality — be a fairly
          remote science fiction scenario. By the time its opportunity comes

          <h4 class="post-title">Time Spiral</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          In the Author’s Note to Peter Hessler’s <em>Oracle Bones</em> (2006,
          subtitled ‘A Journey Between China’s Past and Present’), it is
          explained that:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The main chapters of this book are arranged chronologically, but
            the short sections labeled ‘artifacts’ are not. They reflect a
            deeper sense of time — the ways in which people make sense of
            history after it has receded farther into the past.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As time advances, the past recedes. Modernity, however, is more than
          that. It is the excavation of the past through acceleration into the
          future, a process of discovery, reclamation, and dilation, through
          which the past is explosively expanded. As Hessler realizes, the
          Oracle Bones, indissolubly binding the recovery of China’s deep
          history to its activation of modernity, provide an exemplary
          illustration of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet modernity, as consolidated upon European foundations, has been
          dismissive of Chinese history, seeing only scale without pattern:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            In the traditional view of the Chinese past, there is no
            equivalent of the fall of Rome, no Renaissance, no Enlightenment.
            Instead, emperor succeeds emperor, and dynasty follows dynasty.
            History as wallpaper.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-13"></span>In a Nanjing museum gift shop, Hessler
          glimpses an alternative model:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>At one Nanjing museum, I bought a poster labeled OUTLINE OF
            ANCIENT CHINESE HISTORY. The poster featured a timeline twisted
            into the shape of a spiral. Everything started in the center, at a
            tiny point identified as ‘Yuanmou Ape-man.’  After Yuanmou Ape-man
            (approximately 1.7 million years ago), the timeline passed through
            Peking Man and then made an abrupt turn. By the Xia dynasty, the
            spiral had completed one full circle. The Shang and the Zhou
            dynasties wrapped up a second revolution. The spiral got bigger
            with each turn, as if picking up speed. Whenever something ended —
            a dynasty, a warring state — the spiral was marked with a line and
            a black X, and then something new took its place. There weren’t
            any branches or dead ends. From Yuanmou Ape-man, it took three
            turns of the spiral to reach the revolution of 1911, where the
            timeline finally broke the cycle, straightened out, and pointed
            directly up and off the page.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether folding the historical time line, or expanding a snail
          shell, the spiral synthesizes repetition and growth. It describes a
          <em>cyclic escalation</em> that escapes — or precedes — the
          antagonism between tradition and progress, elucidating restoration
          as something other than a simple return.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a matter of ineluctable importance, because the history of
          modernity is rapidly becoming Chinese, and Chinese history is not
          meandering ‘wallpaper’ but <em>Confucian Restoration</em>,
          conforming to three great waves, each a turn of the spiral, or Gyre.
          Following China’s classical era, and the Song Dynasty rebirth of
          native philosophical tradition, the third Confucian epoch, or second
          Confucian Restoration, is underway today, coinciding exactly with
          the renaissance of Global Modernity (as ‘Modernity 2.0’). As future
          and past evolve — or <em>involve</em> — together, the time-spiral is
          our guide.

          Some unusually brilliant Druidic
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/06/imperfect-storms.html">prophecy</a>
          from John Michael Greer:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Whether the crisis is contained by federal loan guarantees and
            bank nationalizations that keep farms, factories, and stores
            supplied with the credit they need, by the repudiation of debts
            and the issuance of a new currency, by martial law and the
            government seizure of unused acreage, or by ordinary citizens
            cobbling together new systems of exchange in a hurry, as happened
            in Argentina, Russia, and other places where the economy suddenly
            went to pieces, the crisis will be contained.  The negative
            feedback here is provided by the simple facts that people are
            willing to do almost anything to put food on the table,
            governments are willing to do even more to stay in power, and in
            hundreds of previous crises, their actions have proven more than
            sufficient to stop the positive feedback loops of economic crisis
            in their tracks, and stabilize the situation at some level.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>None of this means the crisis will be easy to get through, nor
            does it mean that the world that emerges once the rubble stops
            bouncing and the dust settles will be anything like as prosperous,
            as comfortable, or as familiar as the one we have today. That’s
            true of all three of the situations I’ve sketched out in this
            post. While the next round of crisis along the arc of industrial
            civilization’s decline and fall will likely be over by 2070 of so,
            living through the interval between then and now will probably
            have more than a little in common with living through the First
            World War, the waves of political and social crises that followed
            it, the Great Depression, and the rise of fascism, followed by the
            Second World War and its aftermath—and this time the United States
            is unlikely to be sheltered from the worst impacts of crisis, as
            it was between 1914 and 1954. </em>[Read the whole thing]

        <p>
          Upon learning that America has an Arch-Druid, it would be only
          natural to make some assumptions about his beliefs, and cautious
          guesses would probably be right. The commitments of a religion that
          avoid appeal to the supernatural, one might expect, would be
          characteristically
          <em>down-to-earth</em>, ecological, conservative (in the
          determinedly lower-case and old-fashioned sense), practical, and
          empirical. At its most intellectually abstract, and also most
          (quietly) mystical, druidism would accept the ultimate complicity of
          all reality with a pattern of change that is at once sensible and
          insurmountable, multi-leveled, subtle, and all-enveloping: the
          cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          John Michael Greer, author of the
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com">Arch-Druid Report</a>, eschews spiritual obscurity, at least
          in public. His persona as a
          blogger is that of a calm, lucid, and exceptionally insightful cycle
          theorist. In the strongest and most ineluctable sense, cyclicity is
          the norm, from which nothing truly, or sustainably, departs. A
          cultural formation that loses this druidic grounding, by attaching
          itself to a setting which would break the cycle, thereby destines
          itself to a fall, or reversal of fortune – expressing the inevitable
          reversion to sustainability within a greater wheel of nature and
          history. Balance is less a moral imperative than a cosmic necessity,
          and since sustainability cannot be avoided, it can only also be
          advised.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-52"></span>As an analytical method, druidism is a
          kind of cybernetics, reflecting the mainstream orientation of the
          discipline. Negative feedback, which adjusts towards stability,
          fetches back deviations, to produce normal cycles. Perturbations are
          canceled within natural rhythms. Destabilizing, self-accentuating,
          positive feedback, in contrast, incarnates the unnatural, and is
          thus – from a certain perspective – unreal. Self-reinforcing
          processes accelerate to a crisis, and then collapse, describing a
          wave, or fluctuation, at a greater scale. What seems like an
          irrecoverable deviation has its counterpart within a larger whole,
          matching it exactly in one-sidedness, or violence, and providing the
          complementary reversion that restores equilibrium. A broken cycle is
          part of a more encompassing rhythm, partially perceived. Druidic
          naturalism insists that everything is eventually fetched back,
          because there is nowhere ‘else’ to flee. The
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/06/imperfect-storms.html">law of the earth</a>
          is ultimately inviolable:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… positive feedback [is] extremely rare in the real world,
            because systems with positive feedback promptly destroy themselves
            — imagine a thermostat that responded to rising temperatures by
            heating things up further until the house burns down. Negative
            feedback, by contrast, is everywhere.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          At the largest social scale, pathological deviations, and their
          reversions, are exemplified by the rise and fall of civilizations.
          Historical cycle theorists, such as Spengler and Toynbee, capture
          the recurrent pattern in its essentials. Cultures and all of their
          component parts, including historiography itself, are enveloped and
          directed by these great
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-scheduled-death-of-god.html">rhythms</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every literate urban society, Spengler argued, followed the same
            trajectory from an original folk religion rich in myths, through
            the rise of intellectual theology, the birth of rationalism, the
            gradual dissolution of the religious worldview into rational
            materialism, and then the gradual disintegration of rational
            materialism into a radical skepticism that ends by dissolving
            itself; thereafter ethical philosophies for the intellectuals and
            resurgent folk religion for the masses provide the enduring themes
            for the civilization to come.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Such patterns offer the material for what Greer calls ‘morphology’
          which, on the model (especially) of 18th and 19th century biology,
          extracts regular, comparable shapes from the confusion of varied
          particulars. Among the objects of morphological investigation are
          deep cultural structures, inextricable from religious ideas (in the
          widest sense), which pre-reflectively organize the experience of
          historical time. Globalized Occidental civilization (“modern
          industrial culture”), Greer argues, is characterized by two dominant
          time shapes, at once twinned and aligned, which resonate with an
          unsustainable, positive-feedback dynamic in their pathological
          denial of balance, or eventual reversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before examining these twinned shapes of modern time, some broader
          context can generate ambient illumination. Greer introduces a
          variety of time shapes from non-industrial cultures (and ecologies),
          including the changeless ‘dream time’ of hunter-gatherer societies,
          and the great cycles of pre-modern Chinese tradition. Indeed, his
          sketch of the classical Chinese time-shape appears oddly, even
          fetchingly,
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-shape-of-time.html">druidic</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The basic theory of the Chinese science of time is that events
            are guided by many different cycles, some faster and some slower,
            some influencing one dimension of human life and some shaping
            another.  The cycle of the seasons was one of these; the cycle of
            human life was another; the cycle of the rise and fall of
            dynasties was a third; there were many more, each with its own
            period and typical sequence of events. Just as no two years had
            exactly the same weather on exactly the same days, no two
            repetitions of any other cycle were identical, but common patterns
            allowed the events of one repetition to be more or less predicted
            by a sufficiently broad knowledge of earlier examples.  On a much
            broader scale, all cycles of every kind could be understood as
            expressions of a single abstract pattern of cyclic change, which
            was explored in the classic Chinese textbook of time theory, the I
            Ching — in English, the Book of Change.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The most jarring contrast with the progressive model of time,
          however, is found much closer to it, both in cultural proximity and
          obvious ecological complementarity. It is laid out by Hesiod in his
          <em>Works and Days</em>, where it is articulated as a grinding
          stepwise decline through successive ages, each determined by its
          deterioration relative to the age before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hesiod’s abnormality – or ours – emerges starkly from an overlap. As
          modern historiography progresses, expanding its purchase ever more
          deeply into archeology and paleo-anthropology, it discovers ancient
          societies ‘rising’ from the new stone age (‘neolithic’) to the
          bronze age, and then later, with the advance of metallurgy, entering
          the iron age, with improved weapons and tools. The passage from
          bronze to iron is an obvious leap forward, corresponding to a basic
          threshold of cultural maturation, <strong>locked in</strong> to the
          history of the world by a progressive technological ratchet. How
          disconcerting, then, to find this same sequence repeated by Hesiod,
          but with inverse sign, in a degenerative series of ages — Golden,
          Silver, Bronze, and Iron – that proceed through increments of
          coarsening, from the most noble metal, to the most base.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our deeply-entrenched, progressive perspective, any historical
          meta-narrative structured by relentless decline appears exotically
          strange. The same does not hold within Greer’s ecological framework,
          which couples deviations to reversions within long cycles, so that a
          downward slope is no more abnormal than a persistent incline. Our
          historical optimism finds itself ecologically relativized by a story
          that has no less confidence in its fears than we have in our
          long-consolidated hopes. The explanatory background that Greer
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-shape-of-time.html">supplies</a>
          – themed by soil erosion — has sufficient directionality to match,
          and to carry, Hesiod’s shape of time:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Two thousand years before Hesiod, prehistoric Greece had been the
            home of a lively assortment of village cultures making the slow
            transition from polished stone tools to bronze. On that foundation
            more complex societies rose, borrowing heavily from contemporary
            high cultures in the Middle East, and culminating in the
            monumental architecture and literate palace bureaucracies of the
            Mycenean age. Those of my readers who have some sense of the
            rhythms of history will already know what followed: too much
            clearcutting and intensive farming of the fragile Greek soils,
            made worse by the importation of farming methods better suited to
            flat Mesopotamian valleys than easily eroded Greek hills,
            triggered an ecological crisis; most of the topsoil of Mycenean
            Greece ended up at the bottom of the Aegean Sea, where it can
            still be found in core samples; warfare, migration, and population
            collapse followed in the usual manner, as Mycenean society
            stumbled down the curve of its own Long Descent.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Greer’s readers have been prepared to recognize “its own” as a
          pointer to <strong>our own</strong> – another “Long Descent”
          anticipated by an ecological grounding pattern, this time set by the
          energy-availability curve of Peak Oil. This forecast is a topic for
          another occasion. For now, our concern is more abstract, indifferent
          to the specific mechanism of civilizational limitation, and
          attentive solely to Greer’s claim that the denial of historical
          cyclicity is a form of unwarranted <em>exceptionalism</em>,  founded
          materially in an ecological boost-phase, and reasonably encapsulated
          in the notorious bubble slogan
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/06/a-question-of-values.html"><em>this time it’s
              different</em></a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There’s a wry amusement to be had by thinking through the
            implications of this constantly repeated claim. If our society was
            in fact shaking off the burdens of the past and breaking new
            ground with every minute that goes by, as believers in progress
            like to claim, wouldn’t it be more likely that the theory of
            historical cycles would be challenged each time it appears with
            dazzlingly new, innovative responses that no one had ever imagined
            before?  Instead, in an irony Nietzsche would have relished, the
            claim that history can’t repeat itself endlessly repeats itself,
            in what amounts to an eternal return of the insistence that there
            is no eternal return. What’s more, those who claim that it’s
            different this time seem blissfully unaware that anyone has made
            the same claim before them, and if this is pointed out to them,
            they insist—often with quite some heat—that what they’re saying
            has nothing whatsoever to do with all the other times the same
            argument was used to make the same point down through the years.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It bears repeating that the belief in progress, and the equal and
            opposite belief in apocalypse, are narratives about the
            unknowable. Both claim that the past has nothing to say about the
            future, that something is about to happen that has never happened
            before and that can’t be judged on the basis of any previous
            event.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither progress nor apocalypse, Greer contends, are time-shapes
          well-suited to the realistic evaluation of their ends. [More on that

          <h4 class="post-title">The Shape of Time (Part 2)</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          In the
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-1/">first part</a>
          of this series, we introduced John Michael Greer’s ‘druidic’
          framework for the evaluation of cultural ‘time shapes’ – based on a
          presumption of dominant cyclicity, according to which any prolonged
          deviation or unbalanced process is exposed as an unsustainable
          exception. Within a sufficiently expansive great cycle, any
          continuous progressive trend is complemented by a proportionate
          regression (and, of course, inversely). The cyclic assumption marks
          out each and every image of
          <em>absolute progress</em> as illusory. In this way, the cycle, when
          applied to any particular figure of time, describes an enveloping
          structure that provides pointed critical perspective. (Criticism of
          the cyclic assumption itself — or ‘in turn’ — is best delayed until
          Greer’s most significant positive results have been sketched.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The presently-dominant global civilization – when apprehended at a
          level of extreme (ecological) abstraction – is the fossil-fuel
          burning runaway spurt that Greer
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-actually-happens.html">calls</a>
          “modern industrial culture.” Central to this culture is an
          expectation of growth, founded in an unsustainable ecological
          process, and expressed through distinctive time shapes. The plural
          here is essential, because Greer’s complete ‘<a
            href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/04/an-aside-to-my-readers.html">morphological</a>’
          description of modern time unfolds within a tripartite system of
          classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-72"></span>The first time shape is mostly occluded.
          This is the cyclic model that organizes Greer’s thinking, serving
          both as a pivot and as an enveloping frame. The cyclical
          time-conception defines a ‘middle way’ that exposes abnormality and
          excess through contrast, and also completes a holistic
          comprehension, contextualizing partiality or bias. It functions
          within Greer’s analysis as an intellectual tool, or workshop, more
          than a distinct object of investigation. Given its ‘transcendental’
          status within the druidic order of apprehension, the cycle is not
          limited to a moment of historical origination, or associated with
          the name of a particular cultural authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second time shape is not intrinsically modern, but is rather the
          living ancestor, or vital inheritance, of the culture that would
          eventually assert the terms of global modernity. Of the world’s
          numerous pre-modern time shapes, it is the one that has been
          universalized by its lineal descendents. Greer identifies it
          primarily with Augustine of Hippo, and he assigns it a specific
          birthday: AD 413.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greer
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-song-remains-same.html">argues</a>
          (conventionally), that the collapse of the Christian Empire under
          barbarian onslaught threatened the new faith with a crisis of
          legitimacy, leading Augustine to the radical conclusion that:
          “Ordinary history … has no moral order or meaning.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The place of moral order and meaning in time is found instead in
            sacred history, which has a distinctive linear shape of its own.
            That shape begins in perfection, in the Garden of Eden; disaster
            intervenes, in the form of original sin, and humanity tumbles down
            into the fallen world. From that point on, there are two histories
            of the world, one sacred and one secular. The secular history is
            the long and pointless tale of stupidity, violence and suffering
            that fills the history books; the sacred history is the story of
            God’s dealings with a small minority of human beings — the
            patriarchs, the Jewish people, the apostles, the Christian church
            — who are assigned certain roles in a preexisting narrative.
            Eventually the fallen world will be obliterated, most of its
            inhabitants will be condemned to a divine boot in the face
            forever, and those few who happen to be on the right side will be
            restored to Eden’s perfection, at which point the story ends.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In formulating this story, Augustine gave “the Western world what
          would be, for the next millennium or so, its definitive shape of
          time.” Furthermore, even after the emergence of an alternative, this
          foundational cultural narrative would remain in reserve, constantly
          available as a recourse should its successor falter, betray the
          interests of disaffected groups, or accumulate signs of crisis. The
          Western tradition, when conceived through its ancestral time shape,
          would be perpetuated as an undrained reservoir of apocalyptic
          temptation. The ecological critique of modernity, Greer observes, is
          as fully-saturated with this apocalyptic narrative as any other
          articulation of social dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within modernity proper, however, the Augustinian time shape has
          ceased to be mainstream. Once again, Greer is not reluctant to reach
          for a name and a (rough) date, that of the twelfth century Italian
          mystic “Joachim of Flores … [who] had an impact on the future as
          significant as Augustine’s: he’s the person who kicked down the
          barrier between sacred and secular history that Augustine put so
          much effort into building, and created the shape of time that the
          cultural mainstream occupies to this day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To Joachim, sacred history was not limited to a paradise before
            time, a paradise after it, and the thread of the righteous remnant
            and the redeeming doctrine linking the two.  He saw sacred history
            unfolding all around him in the events of his own time. His vision
            divided all of history into three great ages, governed by the
            three persons of the Christian trinity: the Age of Law governed by
            the Father, which ran from the Fall to the crucifixion of Jesus;
            the Age of Love governed by the Son, which ran from the
            crucifixion to the year 1260; and the Age of Liberty governed by
            the Holy Spirit, which would run from 1260 to the end of the
            world.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What made Joachim’s vision different from any of the visionary
            histories that came before it — and there were plenty of those in
            the Middle Ages — was that it was a story of progress.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does the Joachimite three-stage narrative of progress
          introduce the idea of uncompensated advance, it also legitimates a
          trend to secularization, as the institutional structures appropriate
          to the patriarchal and filial epochs are dissolved in the new age of
          revolutionary liberty. Unsurprisingly, radical intellectuals and
          movements seized upon this schema as a blueprint for the
          dispossession of the Old Order, ensuring its general popularization.
          As modernity was serially ‘revolutionized’ it became ever more
          Joachimite in its basic assumptions, until progress had been
          installed as a dominant ‘<a
            href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-religion-of-progress.html">civil religion</a>‘.
          Eventually, the progressive idea had been normalized to the
          point of near-total invisibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the outlining of the Augustinian and Joachimite ‘visions’,
          Greer’s classification of modern time shapes approaches
          completeness. The entire argument, when schematically reviewed, can
          be decomposed into a number of distinct and informative claims:<br />
          (a) The culture of modern global civilization is dominated by
          exactly two principal time shapes.<br />
          (b) These time shapes are in certain respects culturally arbitrary,
          arising in specific times and places, without any original logical
          inter-dependency, and inflected by the concerns of a particular
          religious tradition.<br />
          (c) This arbitrariness is further confirmed by the morphological
          richness each time shape reveals, a feature that supports confident
          identification and classification of superficially differentiated
          variants.<br />
          (d) Despite the absence of logical necessity, when historically
          assembled into a mature, dyadic system, the combined
          Augustinian-Joachimite duality evidences a significant measure of
          reciprocal order (or effective ‘dialectical unity’) and a near
          exhaustive purchase upon the modern cultural imagination —
          conformity and dissent.<br />
          (e) The complementarity of the dyad approximately corresponds to
          symmetrical judgments of (Joachimite) affirmation and (Augustinian)
          negation of a prevailing historical trend.<br />
          (f) Regardless of their manifest power of captivation, the
          Augustinian-Joachimite dyad has a limit, best described by the
          cyclic time model from which each side of the duality diverges.

          <h4 class="post-title">The Shape of Time (Part 2a)</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          When describing the thinking of John Michael Greer as ‘druidic’ – as
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-1/">this</a>
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-2/">series</a>
          has cheerfully done – the adjective has been primarily philosophical
          in direction. It has been used only to indicate that an
          identifiable, and remarkably coherent, presupposition about the
          governing nature of time anchors Greer’s particular analyses, which
          draw out the implications of an unsurpassable cosmic cyclicity, and
          apply them deftly to a wide variety of concrete problems. ‘Druid’
          and ‘radical cycle theorist’ have been treated as roughly equivalent
          terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth noting at this point, however, that Greer is not only
          conceptually druidic. He is a public proponent of Druidism in a far
          richer, culturally-elaborate sense, which
          <a href="http://redroom.com/member/john-michael-greer/bio">includes</a>
          service “as presiding officer — Grand Archdruid is the official
          title — of the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), a Druid
          order founded in 1912.” This vocation slants his perspective in
          important (and productive) ways. Our concerns here, tightly focused
          on the question of time, are able to extract considerable
          intellectual nourishment from a digression into this thick druidism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like other forms of occult Occidental religion, Druidry has an
          attachment to the deep past that is not tacit and traditional, but
          overt, modern, and creative. Greer admits readily – even gleefully –
          that his ‘Ancient Order’ is not in fact ancient at all, but instead
          belongs to a project of restoration – and actually reconstruction –
          that dates back no further than the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century.
          From its inception, it was bound to a lost past and to
          inextinguishable doubts about its own authenticity. Greer only very
          rarely uses his <em>Archdruid Report</em> platform to discuss
          druidism explicitly. On the first
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2006/05/real-druids.html">occasion</a>
          when he does so, his reflections are triggered by the question of a
          young boy: <em>Are you a <strong>real</strong> Druid?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-101"></span><em>It’s not an easy question to answer. The original Druids, the
            priests and wizards of the ancient Celts, went extinct more than a
            thousand years ago, and all their beliefs, practices, and
            teachings went with them.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, he
          <a href="http://aoda.org/Articles/What_is_the_Druid_Revival.html">explains</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who were the Druids? The honest answer is that we really don’t
            know. Most of what was written about them in ancient times
            vanished forever when the Roman Empire collapsed. Every surviving
            text written about the Druids while they still existed, put
            together, add up to ten pages or so in English translation. …
            Druids in training memorized many lines of verse, since it was
            forbidden to set down their teachings in writing. … Julius Caesar,
            whose book on the Roman conquest of Gaul is the most detailed
            source on the Druids, noted that Druidic teachings were thought to
            come from Britain originally, while a Greek scholar claimed that
            the Druids got their lore from the Greek philosopher Pythagoras;
            no other writer refers to the subject. … archeologists and
            historians were able to prove conclusively that the Druidry of the
            Revival was a modern spiritual movement, not an ancient one.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern druidry is a <em>revival</em>, which is to say that it
          originates through identification with something that is dead. Its
          modernity is stretched and activated, to become more than mere
          succession, and more even than self-conscious, differentiated
          succession — or ‘advance’. The discontinuity that defines ‘the
          Revival’ cannot be reduced to a transition, however radical.
          Instead, it corresponds to an uncertain reaching back, through the
          still-living past and beyond, towards a lost beginning. In this way
          it initiates a process — and a new tradition — that cannot easily be
          resolved into distinct elements of invention and re-animation. In
          its quest for ancient origins, it relocates the present within an
          expanded comprehension of historical time. This complex,
          quasi-paradoxical cultural undertaking, is at once typically modern,
          and anti-modern. By distancing itself from passive accommodation to
          its historical moment, it epitomizes this same moment in its
          concrete historical reality — as a revolt against simple continuity.
          It represents a dramatic neo-traditionalism, of an Occidental type.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time-traveler tends to produce — or become — a double, and the
          modern Druid is no exception. Something ‘ancient’ is returned to
          life, so that re-animator and re-animated co-exist in a folded
          present, cross-identified, and ambiguously co-original, or
          coincidental. Do the Druids of the Revival ‘still’ believe the
          archaic wisdom of cyclicity, now rediscovered, or do they project it
          back onto the blank screen of an erased antiquity? Who is the copy
          here? We are returned, inexorably, to a problem of identification
          (“<em>Are you a <strong>real</strong> Druid?</em>“), model and
          derivation, originality and repetition. A search for reality has
          become inextricable from an exercise in duplicity, twisted into a
          reflective or introspective circle, and spun out into an
          investigation of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As this perplexity develops, the term ‘Druid Revival’ comes to seem
          like something more than an arbitrary conjunction. Its two words are
          not merely joined, but doubled, as an echo of time disturbance. Each
          points independently towards a pre-implanted pattern of return, with
          the cycle already registered on both sides. Greer
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2006/05/real-druids.html">traces</a>
          the ‘real roots’ of this doubling to a discontinuous connection:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Some modern Druid groups in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to
            their lasting discredit, claimed direct connections to the ancient
            Celtic Druids they didn’t have. The real roots of the modern Druid
            movement go in a different direction: to the first stages of the
            Industrial Revolution in early 18th century Britain, and the
            Hobson’s choice between dogmatic religion and materialist science,
            the two victors in the reality wars of the late Renaissance.
            Plenty of people sought a third option that embraced nature and
            spirit alike, and some of them found inspiration in the scraps of
            classical writing, medieval legend, and Celtic folklore that
            referred to the ancient Druids.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Historians call the result the Druid Revival,” he continues, as if
          determined to separate this twin term from anything that modern
          druidry first said about itself. He recognizes, perhaps, that
          <em>druidism is the philosophy (or religion) of revival</em> — or of
          the full ‘ecological’ cycle through life and death — so that to draw
          upon this word (‘revival’) threatens to represent the return of
          druidic thinking through itself, in a closed circle of
          self-confirmation, persuasive only to those of prior druidic (or,
          more narrowly, cycle-theoretical) inclination. Better, then, that
          ‘historians’ seal this circle, from outside, and thereby demonstrate
          its real coincidence, or simple reality. The Revival is noticed as
          historical fact, before it is cycled back into druidic intelligence,
          as a doctrinal expectation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each year is a cyclical time unit of death and revival, and in this
          it is a primordial teacher, in a way that no scripture could ever
          be. That, at least, is the folk pagan understanding that Druid
          Revival restores to ritualistic primacy, and adopts as its guiding
          cognitive model. Its own revival, therefore, is ‘only natural’, or
          self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring thinking into compliance with the great cycles is
          immediately to participate in a speculative super-tradition,
          sustained by a structure of ideas and apprehension that
          <em>cannot but return</em>. In the thought of the cycle there is
          already implied a non-originality, binding the thinker, across time,
          to all those who necessarily understand the way things have to
          happen again. What, then, is ancient origin, and what revival? When
          would one look for a ‘real Druid’?
        </p>
        <p>
          [This digression has a little further to stray, along a more
          concrete path, before critical distance is restored.]

        </a>
        <p>
          Anyone who isn’t yet
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.hk/">reading</a>
          <em>The Archdruid Report</em> really ought to be. John Michael Greer
          is quite simply one of the most brilliant writers in existence, and
          even when he’s wrong, he’s importantly wrong. His perspective is
          coherent, learned, and uncaged by the assumptions of progressivism.
          Above all, his understanding of what it means to find history
          informative is unsurpassed. (Over at the Other Place, there’s an
          unfinished Greer series that badly requires attention, with the
          first three installments
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-1/">here</a>,
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-2/">here</a>,
          and
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-2a/">here</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          When escalated to the extreme, the progressive conclusion is that
          history can teach us nothing. Innovation is by its very nature
          unprecedented, and insofar as it manifests improvement, it humbles
          its precursors. The past is the rude domicile of ignorant barbarity.
          Insofar as the present still bears its traces, as shameful stigmata,
          they are mere remains that still have to be overcome. At the limit,
          the concept of Singularity — a horizon at which all anticipatory
          knowledge is annulled — seals the progressive intuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its abstract theoretical core, at least, Greer’s Druidic
          counter-history is radically reactionary (far more unambiguously so
          than NRx). Its model of time is entirely cyclical, such that past
          and future are perfectly neutral between ascent and decline. Every
          attempt to install a gradient of improvement in the dimension of
          historical time is broken upon the great wheels, which balance every
          rise with a fall, dissolving innovation in precedent. Novelty is
          hubristic illusion (an exaggerated correction, in the opinion of
          this blog).
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-3018"></span></p>
        <p>
          In his most recent
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.hk/2014/07/bright-were-halls-then.html">post</a>
          Greer introduces an intriguing complication:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Arnold Toynbee, whose magisterial writings on history have been a
            recurring source of inspiration for this blog, has pointed out an
            intriguing difference between the way civilizations rise and the
            way they fall. On the way up, he noted, each civilization tends to
            diverge not merely from its neighbors but from all other
            civilizations throughout history. […] Once the peak is past and
            the long road down begins, though, that pattern of divergence
            shifts into reverse, slowly at first, and then with increasing
            speed. A curious sort of homogenization takes place: distinctive
            features are lost, and common patterns emerge in their place. That
            doesn’t happen all at once, and different cultural forms lose
            their distinctive outlines at different rates, but the further
            down the trajectory of decline and fall a civilization proceeds,
            the more it resembles every other civilization in decline.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The dissymmetry calls out for philosophical investigation, since it
          suggests a line of synthetic diagonalization between precedent and
          innovation, cyclicity and escape (which is to say, the NRx or
          cybergothic line). It would be to stray too far from Greer to follow
          that now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Straightforwardly, the claim being made is that forecasting
          strengthens on the down-slope of civilization. The more a social
          order fails, the more it sheds its originality, and thus the more
          accessible it becomes to accurate diagnosis on the basis of
          historical example. As collapse deepens, it converges with a
          template, bound ever tighter to a model by its morbidity. Across the
          peak, an age of prophecy begins — or returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dark irony is delicious almost beyond endurance. The Universal,
          long proclaimed as the capstone of progress, is realized only as a
          nadir. The equality of all civilizations is asserted, in reality, as
          a direct measure of their proximity to death. Among the spreading
          ruins, the mad echoes of similarity resound deafeningly, as the
          blasted Cathedral plummets towards its Idea — eternal return of the
          same.

      <section class="post">
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/time-scales/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Time Scales</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          The word ‘neoreaction’ is a split, productively paradoxical formula,
          simultaneously referencing two incompatible cultural formations,
          each corresponding to an abstract model of time. On one side, it is
          a gateway opening onto techno-libertarian hyper-progressivism, and
          an order of time structured by irreversible accumulation,
          self-envelopment, and catastrophe horizon (Singularity). On the
          other, it opens onto the temporality of reaction and the cycle,
          where all progress is illusion, and all innovation anticipated.
          Within NRx, the time of escape and the time of return seek an
          obscure synthesis, at once unprecedented and primordial, whose
          cryptic figure is the
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/t-shirt-slogans-13/">spiral</a>.
          (This is the time of the Old Ones and the Outside, from which the
          shoggoth come.) If NRx thinks itself already lodged articulately in
          this synthesis, it deludes itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a strictly philosophical perspective, the time of reaction
          finds no defender more able than
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.hk/">Archdruid</a> John
          Michael <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/greer/">Greer</a>. while
          his specific form of religious traditionalism, his social attitudes,
          and his eco-political commitments are all profoundly questionable
          from the standpoint of throne-and altar
          <a href="http://www.maistre.polthought.cam.ac.uk/">reaction</a>, his
          model of time cannot be surpassed in an Old Right direction. Those
          who would install a prejudice of relentless degeneration in its
          place, anchored by a revealed religion of recent creation and
          subsequent continuous fall, only position themselves to the ‘right’
          of Greer by making God a revolutionary. If deep time is to be
          preserved, there can be no archaic authority beyond the cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why call Greer a reactionary? It is not, after all, a label he would
          accept for himself. The answer lies in cyclical time, and everything
          that follows from it: the supremacy of wisdom among human things,
          the enduring authority of history, the dismissal of modernist
          pretension as a mere mask for deep historical repetition, an
          absolute disillusionment with progress, and an adamantine prognosis
          that — from the peak of fake ‘improvement’ where we find ourselves —
          a grinding course of decline over coming centuries is an
          inevitability. The cultural and political decoration can be faulted,
          but in the fundamental structure of Greer’s thinking, reaction is
          perfected.
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-3043"></span></p>
        <p>
          There is a religious consideration to be noted here, as the stepping
          stone to another point. Once the cyclical counter-assumption is
          adopted — in a definitive break from modernist ideology — it leads
          inexorably to an expansion of the time frame. To see the pattern, it
          is necessary to pan out. An apparent rise is only rendered
          intelligible by its complementary fall. An event makes sense to the
          extent that it can be identified as a repetition, through
          subsumption into a persistent rhythm, which means that to understand
          it is to pull back from it, into ever wider expanses of history.
          Recognized precedent is wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaction is thus construed as a critique of modernist myopia. The
          appearance of innovation derives from a failure to see a larger
          whole. If something looks new, it is because not enough is being
          seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          No surprise, then, to find Greer seize upon an
          <a href="http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.it/2012/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html">opportunity</a>
          to
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.hk/2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html">discuss</a>
          <em>The Next Ten Billion Years</em>. At such scales, fluctuations of
          fortune are fully contextualized, so that no uncompensated
          progressions remain. After just 1% of this time has passed:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The long glacial epoch that began in the Pleistocene has finally
            ended, and the Earth is returning to its more usual status as a
            steamy jungle planet. This latest set of changes proves to be just
            that little bit too much for humanity. No fewer than 8,639 global
            civilizations have risen and fallen over the last ten million
            years, each with its own unique sciences, technologies, arts,
            literatures, philosophies, and ways of thinking about the cosmos;
            the shortest-lived lasted for less than a century before blowing
            itself to smithereens, while the longest-lasting endured for eight
            millennia before finally winding down.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>All that is over now. There are still relict populations of human
            beings in Antarctica and a few island chains, and another million
            years will pass before cascading climatic and ecological changes
            finally push the last of them over the brink into extinction.
            Meanwhile, in the tropical forests of what is now southern
            Siberia, the descendants of raccoons who crossed the Bering land
            bridge during the last great ice age are proliferating rapidly,
            expanding into empty ecological niches once filled by the larger
            primates. In another thirty million years or so, their descendants
            will come down from the trees.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Everything that rises will fall.</p>
        <p>
          Such vastly panned-out perspectives are also relevant to the
          competitive catastrophe theorizing that is so close to the dead
          heart of this blog. Any conceivable disaster has an associated
          time-frame, within which it is no more than a wandering fluctuation.
          Recovery from deep dysgenic decline requires only a few millennia,
          extinction of the human species perhaps a few tens of millions of
          years, full restoration of terrestrial fossil fuel deposits, 100
          million years or so. Vicissitudes on the down-side scarcely register
          as tremors in the meanderings of geological time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is more to time-scales than more time. Whatever else
          <em>anthropomorphism</em> is — and it is a lot of other things — it
          is a scale of time. To be human is to be situated, distinctively,
          within a spectrum of frequencies. In our wavelength zone, a second
          is a short time, and a century is long. These lower and upper bounds
          of significant duration correspond respectively to the biophysics of
          mammalian motility and to the outer-limits of mortal plans. The
          cosmic arbitrariness of this scalar time region is very easy to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital tick of time in our universe is set by the passage of a
          photon across a Planck-length (in a vacuum), approximately 5.4 x
          10^-44 seconds. This is not a number readily intuited. A
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cosmological-infancy/">comparison</a>
          to the (mere) 4.3 x 10^17 seconds that have so far lapsed during the
          entire history of the universe perhaps provides some vague sense.
          (Anthropomorphic time-scale bias is at least roughly as blinding to
          minuscule durations as to enormous ones.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The upper limits of the cosmic time-scale are harder to identify.
          Speculative cosmological models predict the evolution of the
          Universe out to 10^60 years or more, when the last of the black
          holes have evaporated. The Stelliferous Era (in which new stars are
          born) is expected to last for only 100 trillion (10^14) years, out
          to approximately 7,000 times the present age of the universe. (If
          the stelliferous universe were analogized to a human being with a
          one-century life-expectancy, it would presently be an infant, just
          entering its sixth post-natal day, with 987 billion years to wait
          until its anthropomorphic first birthday).
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the human time scale lie immensities, and intensities. The
          latter are especially susceptible to neglect. When — over half a
          century ago — Richard Feynman anticipated nano-engineering with the
          <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~yang/RFeynman_plentySpace.pdf">words</a>
          [there’s] “Plenty of Room at the Bottom” he opened prospects of time
          involution, as well as miniaturization in space. A process migrating
          in the direction of the incomprehensibly distant Planck limit makes
          time for itself, in a way quite different from any endurance in
          temporal extension. Consider ‘now’ to be a
          <a href="http://v2.nl/archive/articles/split-second-timing-text">second</a>, as it is approximately at the
          anthropomorphic scale, and its
          inner durations are potentially near-limitless — vastly exceeding
          all the time the human species could make available to itself even
          by persisting to the death of the universe’s last star. A
          <a
            href="http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/01/10/theres-plenty-more-room-bottom-beyond-nanotech-femtotech/">femto</a>-scale
          intelligence system could explore the rise and fall of
          entire biological phyla, in detail, in a period so minuscule it
          would entirely escape human apprehension as sub-momentary, or
          subliminal. The ultimate eons are less ahead than within.
        </p>
        <p>
          Greer envisages no escape from the anthropomorphic bandwidth of
          time. Within his far-future speculation, each new intelligent
          species that arises is implicitly ‘anthropomorphic’ in this sense.
          After Earth has died, its particles are strewn among the nearby
          stars, and incorporated into the body of an alien species:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The creature’s biochemistry, structure, and life cycle have
            nothing in common with yours, dear reader. Its world, its sensory
            organs, its mind and its feelings would be utterly alien to you,
            even if ten billion years didn’t separate you. Nonetheless, it so
            happens that a few atoms that are currently part of your brain, as
            you read these words, will also be part of the brain-analogue of
            the creature on the crag on that distant, not-yet-existing world.
            Does that fact horrify you, intrigue you, console you, leave you
            cold?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          If coldness is the appropriate response to seeing time still
          imprisoned, ten billion years from now, then Greer’s vision is
          chilling. For it to be compelling, however, would take far more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though only implicit, it would be grudging to deny Greer credit for
          the excavation of a crucial reactionary proposition:
          <em>Nothing will ever break into the vaults of time</em>. This is
          not an assertion to which <em>Outside in</em> is yet ready to defer.

            event, regardless of the facts.” […] If we <strong>did</strong> do

        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>Ice ages last for <strong>tens of millions</strong> of years. We
            don’t know how many there have been. Our planet is 4½ billion
            years old; we only have clear evidence of ice ages for the last
            billion years, in which time there have been four ice ages,
            covering a total of one-third of a billion years. In its “normal”
            condition — the other two-thirds — the Earth is ice-free all the
            way up to the poles. […] The present ice age started around 2½
            million years ago. Our best guess is that it’ll continue for
            several million years more. […] <strong>Within</strong> this ice
            age there have been ups and downs. The downs are called
            “glaciations,” the ups — comparatively warm spells, like the one

          <h4 class="post-title">Tackling Templexity</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Since there are a number of critical tasks that cannot be advanced
          prior to straightening out some knotty problems of time topology, UF
          has added a <em>Templexity</em>
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/templexity/">page</a> (as a work in
          progress). It will eventually provide supporting apparatus for an
          <em>Urbanatomy Electronic</em> product of the same name, due out this
          fall. What cannot be straightened out, of course won’t be — but
          something will occur. What holds for macro-history holds no less for
          micro-history, with the two entangling, rather than resonating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cultural pretext for this investigation is Rian Johnson’s
          <em><a
              href="http://io9.com/5926757/why-looper-could-be-the-most-well-thought+out-time-travel-movie-in-years">Looper</a></em>,
          whose very crudities and short-cuts become informative, when
          approached from the right angle.<br />
          The perspective of <em>Templexity</em> is arranged by the postulate:
          <em>Time-travel is the dramatization of something else</em>.<br />
          The firm hypothesis: Shanghai is a time machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>“You should go to China,” Joe is told by his criminal overseer,
            Abe. “I’m going to France,” Joe insists stubbornly. Abe responds
            with what – for us – is the most critical line in the movie: “I’m
            from the future. You should go to China.” With these words,
            <strong>Looper</strong> makes Sino-Futurism its topic. The
            hyper-modern <strong>China Event</strong> is too vast to fit simply
            into time.</em>

        <p>
          Ben Woodard has put up a valuable

          that delves into the centrality of time-disturbance to the problems of
          accelerationism. If the accelerationist intuition is
          <em>on to something</em>, traffic between these zones of discussion
          can only thicken.

          Thank you
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Templexity-Disordered-Loops-through-Shanghai-ebook/dp/B00PAC2L00">Amazon</a>.
          Despite some frustrations with the Kindle Direct Publishing
          interface — which isn’t designed for editorial convenience — the
          excitement of disintermediation-in-action more than makes up for it.
          If the self-publishing system reached the stage where writers spent
          their time on the platform, as a work-space, in the same way they can
          on a blog today, the horizon of possibility would be pushed out to yet
          inconceivable distances.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Templexity</strong></em> aims to catalyze a theoretical
          coagulation where the philosophy of time, contemporary (complex)
          urbanism, and pulp entertainment media are complicit in an approach to
          singularity (as a topic, a thing, and a nonlinear knotting of the two
          (at least)). It proposes that the urban process and the techno-science
          of time machines is undergoing rapid convergence. (This seems to be a
          suggestion whose
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/quotable-45/">time</a> has come.) Grasp
          the opportunity offered by computers to visualize what cities really
          are, and the dynamics of retro-temporalization are graphically
          displayed.

          That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein">being</a> for which
          the being of time is opened as an exploratory path is the advanced
          global metropolis. This is a contention already tacked to a cinematic,
          mass-media revelation, although one formatted by deeply-traditional
          dramatic criteria, thus systematically, and automatically, encrypted.

          Far more on all this later. (If I say too much now, I’m worried I
          might save you $4.00.)

          as the apex of a ‘Great Awakening’ in the sense at stake here, but
          perhaps not such a stretch to think it was picking up on some strange

            the delusion that things would somehow turn out all right. I do hope

        <p align="left">
          For one theoretical account of how history might rhyme, on an ominous
          80-year cycle, there’s a generational model that
          <a href="http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/quinn/2010/0223.html">sets</a>
          the beat. “Strauss &amp; Howe have established that history can be

          turnings: The High, The Awakening, The Unraveling, and the
          Crisis.” From a philosophical point of view, it seems a little
          under-powered, but its empirical plausibility rises by the month.

          <span id="more-1579"></span>Among Shanghai’s anomalies is a peculiar
          relation to the 1930s. For the city beyond the International
          Settlement, the decade slid into disaster when Sino-Japanese
          hostilities broke out in 1937. Yet the preceding period was not marked
          by depression, but by exuberant High Modernism. Dates from the
          1930s that would in much of the world seem distinctly sinister are
          displayed on the city’s historic buildings as a mark of Golden Age
          authenticity. For the paranoid mind, that would slot neatly into the
          same disturbing rhyme scheme today.

        <p align="left">
          Throughout most of the rich world, economic, political, and cultural
          decay seemed — retrospectively — to presage the coming cataclysm, as
          if nothing less could jolt exhausted social systems from their
          relentless downward slide. Almost everywhere, some version of fascist
          thinking was seized upon as the antidote to relentlessly gathering
          malaise. Beneath the surface of the global geostrategic order,
          shifting tectonic plates accumulated intolerable tension. Degenerate
          monetary systems came apart into uncontrollable swirls of
          dysfunctional signs.

        <p>
          As this blog spirals around to its re-starting point, it fetches back
          the tasks it has yet to advance upon, including the most basic
          (announced in its sub-title). Why the ‘Decopunk Delta’? Mostly because
          that’s where time frays.
        </p>
        <p>
          + Golden Age Shanghai is unsettled business, and as things surge
          forward, they turn back.<br />
          + Art Deco is the world’s lost modernity, as everyone senses, without
          quite knowing how.<br />
          + Art Deco escaped its time, at the time. It is the pre-eminent
          time-travel relic of the earth.<br />
          + What Art Deco communicates is vivid, yet still unverbalized.<br />
          + Art Deco fascinates again, today, because it is obscurely recognized
          as the key to the encrypted meaning of world history, and nowhere is
          this more insistently hinted than in re-opened Shanghai.
        </p>
        <p>
          – The ‘-punk’ suffix is pulp-code for any cultural time-travel tool
          undergoing contemporary development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-144"></span>The two halves of the term ‘Decopunk’ bond
          through a peculiar quasi-symmetry. Each is time-locked into an
          identifiable ‘vogue’, while simultaneously making a problem of time,
          and a topic of history. Art Deco is at once the most evocative
          characteristic of an epoch — that of high-modernity / capitalism — and
          a super-historical exploration, extending from the archaic remnants of
          lost civilizations to flights of science-fictional speculation,
          drawing the entire cosmos of aesthetic and architectural possibility
          into itself. The still-proliferating ‘-punk’ suffix, similarly,
          designates both an eruption of near-contemporary pulp-literary genres,
          and a method of time pillage, ranging widely across past and future on
          searches for extractable sets, or techno-cultural styles. Something
          like an abstract epochality, or historical re-use value, is hunted on
          each side. When the two connect, original occurrence is swirled into a
          twin-process recycling machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Decopunk describes a precision-engineered inter-meshing across
          time, it also marks a tension, or gradient, from the historical to the
          contemporary, from opulence to squalor, from optimism to pessimism,
          and from the tangible to the digital. What the past’s virtual present
          tends to over-estimate, the present’s virtual past tends to undermine,
          and it is only in the unstable circuit of oscillating valuation that
          either pole finds its real currency (which is equally that of the
          other). A euphoric cynicism, honed through spiral detachment from the
          partial and the actual, melds poly-fractional Decopunk into a single,
          investigable thing.

          The conceptual content of the alternative history ‘-punk’ was a
          central consideration of the (<em><a
              href="http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/list/urban-future">UF1.1</a></em>)
          series <em>A Time-Traveler’s Guide to Shanghai</em> (<a

          <a href="http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/articles/730">Part 3</a>).
          The grungier and more popular — although for our purposes far less
          exact — term ‘Dieselpunk’ was employed in these pieces, as a
          place-holder for the emerging problem of time dislocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the most prominent cultural-historical questions raised by
          Shanghai’s Art Deco legacy were briefly indicated in the
          <em>Urbanatomy</em> guide to the 2010 World Expo, in a short section
          repeated here:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Tropical Modernity</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Cosmopolitanism is an essential trait for any city with aspirations
            to global status. In itself, however, the cosmopolitan idea is too
            abstract and empty, or at least indeterminate, to provide adequate
            guidance into Shanghai’s dominant cultural traditions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The economic and communicative shrinkage of the world makes
            modernity, no less than urbanism, inherently cosmopolitan. Since the
            1960s, postmodern critics have reconstructed (and ‘deconstructed’) a
            model of cosmopolitan modernism that conforms to the vision of its
            most verbally articulate architectural proponents. This vision
            identified itself with the ‘International Style’, characterized by
            austerely functional, geometrically pure designs. By eliminating
            every element with discernible historical or cultural reference,
            such designs aspired to universal validity and relevance. The result
            was a negative cosmopolitanism, conceived as an escape from the trap
            of native peculiarity. This claim to cultural neutrality and
            universal authority has been the basic object of postmodernist
            disparagement, and the widespread social disaster associated with
            this philosophy of urban construction in Western countries (‘the
            projects’) did much to legitimate the postmodern case. In elite and
            popular opinion alike, high modernism, as represented by its
            supposedly mainstream traditions in urban planning and architecture,
            became associated with an arrogant insensitivity to local realities,
            and a self-deluding confidence in its own objective
            inevitability.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The importance of Shanghai to this discussion, is that it entirely
            disdained the modernism of the International, at least until very
            recent times (following the opening of Pudong). Its high modernity
            was constructed in the more luxuriant or tropical styles that are
            today grouped together under the label ‘Art Deco’, in retrospective
            reference to the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs
            of 1925. Where the International Style rejected every kind of
            superfluity, Art Deco reveled in cultural complexity, arcane
            symbolism and opulence of reference, borrowing freely from the
            temples of ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, ballistic technology,
            science fiction objects, hermetic glyphs and alien dreams. Fusing
            streamline design trends with fractionated, cubist forms and the
            findings of comparative ethnography, it created a luscious
            cosmopolitan style, perfectly adapted to the Shanghai of the early
            20th century.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Shanghai has been as thoroughly saturated with Art Deco heritage
            and influence as any city in the world. Examples include such
            treasures as the Capitol Building (146 Huqiu Lu, CH Gonda, 1928),
            the Grand Theater (now Grand Cinema, 216 Nanjing W, Rd, Hudec,
            1928), the Peace Hotel (Bund 19-20, Palmer &amp; Turner, 1929) and
            the Paramount Ballroom (Yang Ximiao, 218 Yuyuan Rd, 1932). An
            especially stunning Art Deco cluster can be found at the ‘Municipal
            Square’ intersection of Jiangxi Middle Road and Fuzhou Road,
            dominated by Hamilton House (Palmer &amp; Turner,1931), the
            Metropole Hotel (Palmer &amp; Turner,1934) and the Commercial Bank
            of China (Davies, Brooke and Gran, 1936). Much of this fabulous
            architectural legacy has been documented in the work of local
            photographer Deke Erh.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Art Deco styling became so deeply infused into the fabric of the
            city that its patterning and distinctive motifs (such as sunbursts,
            zig-zags and mystical signs) can be seen on innumerable lilong
            gateways from the 1920-40s. At another extreme, the city’s
            ultramodern Jin Mao Tower in Lujiazui (88 Century Avenue)
            synthesizes crystalline forms, pagoda segmentation, and patterns
            derived from traditional Chinese numerology, under the guidance of
            unmistakable Art Deco influences. An even more pronounced example of
            contemporary Art Deco construction and decoration is provided by the
            new Peninsula Hotel, which has been meticulously designed as a
            conscious tribute to (and revivification of) Shanghai’s high
            modernist style.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In contrast to the austerity of the International Style, the
            tropical abundance of Art Deco produces a positive cosmopolitanism,
            advancing to the universal by way of comprehension and synthesis,
            rather than exclusive purification. It makes itself global by
            drawing everything foreign into itself, rather than by divesting
            itself of native traits. From this difference, much follows.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In the West, a generalized disillusionment with modernism,
            resulting from harsh historical experiences, civilizational guilt,
            and relative geostrategic decline, found articulate expression in
            postmodern arguments and, more popularly, attitudes. These stances
            achieved a measure of coherence through a critical construction of
            modernism, modeled on the International Style. Postwar trends in
            urban development, based on rigid zoning, geometrical
            rationalization of the cityscape, and blandly uniform mass
            residential highrise blocks, seemed to exemplify an archetypal
            modernist mentality. Urban modernity was construed as something that
            had been tried, seen, understood, judged, and rejected. The
            postmodern cultural episode ensued.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Art Deco, however, eluded this entire dismal progression. An
            assertively modern, comprehensive style that had embraced the
            machine age and a communicatively interconnected world, it remained
            wholly untainted by the minimalism and master-planning of the
            International Stylists. The thunderous culture clash between
            ‘modernists’ and postmodernists that resounded through the Western
            world in the late 20th century bypassed it completely. Art Deco thus
            represents an unprocessed or undigested modernity, still pulsing
            with historical enigma and non-exhausted potentialities. The
            continuing vibrancy of Art Deco is misapprehended by notions of
            anachronism or nostalgia, since it is a style that has never been
            concluded, delimited, surpassed, or adequately evaluated. It is the
            almost infinitely complex symbol of a prematurely discarded modern
            spirit, re-animated spontaneously by the renewal of modernity
            itself. Art Deco’s persistent and compelling claim upon aesthetic,
            intellectual, and even political attention are nowhere more obvious
            than in contemporary Shanghai.</em>

          <h4 class="post-title">Gardens of Time (Part 1)</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          It might be presumptuous to assume there is any such thing as the Idea
          of cultivation. The absence of any such idea (a deficiency that is
          immediately stimulative) could readily be imagined as the condition
          that makes cultivation necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the search for a conclusive concept is abandoned, the cultural
          task of the garden — in its loftiest (Jiangnan) expression — begins to
          be understood. No less that the acknowledged fine arts of East or
          West, the Suzhou garden merits appreciation as a philosophical
          ‘statement’ in which aesthetic achievement is inextricable from a
          profound
          <em>apprehension of reality</em>. Perhaps, then, no short-cut or
          summary seeking to economize on the creation and preservation of the
          garden itself could possibly arrive at the same ‘place’, or — even
          with the most restricted sense of cognitive purchase — discover the
          same things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-148"></span>Anachronistically conceived, the Suzhou
          garden is a multimedia experiment, incorporating various types of
          writing among its parts. Alongside, or embedded amid, pavilions,
          walls, bridges, rockeries, ponds, animals, vegetation, furnishings,
          ornamental carvings, and paintings, are found calligraphic scrolls and
          inscriptions that make words an ingredient of the garden. Language is
          something included, and trained, within a comprehensive ensemble. From
          the beginning, the immoderate passions of exile and dominion are
          stripped from the cultivated sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          To draw upon ulterior signs in order to talk <em>about</em> the garden
          — especially the generic garden — introduces a problem of framing, but
          this, too, has been meticulously anticipated, in a variety of ways.
          Framing is the principal method of the garden, and its supreme
          artifice. Whether through simple ‘picture’ frames, that transform —
          for instance — a slice of stone into an artwork, or elaborate
          constructions of gates, doorways, windows, apertures, alcoves,
          interiors, and viewpoints, it is the framing of perspective that
          <em>aestheticizes</em>. What produces the garden as a cultivated whole
          — most fundamentally — is its perspectival sub-division into itself.
          When the garden is analytically decomposed, in accordance with its own
          ‘grain’, it breaks down into a myriad scenes. It is made out of pieces
          of contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The garden makes its own outsides — numerously — in order to appear,
          piece by piece. It cannot, therefore, be assumed that one has left the
          garden, simply because one is commenting upon it ‘from without’. No
          less probably, the garden has itself provided the frames that now
          escape into a prolonged contemplation, as its scenes are pursued on
          some path of ever deepening disclosure. To apprehend the garden, and
          reality through the garden, is the garden. The garden is a perspective
          machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a scenic device arranged in space, the garden is almost endlessly
          intricate, but still comparatively tractable. The spatial puzzle is
          resolved in stages as the visitor passes through a sequence of
          apprehensions, serially adjusting position and the direction of
          attention, tuning into perceptual frames, and synthesizing
          associations. This is a process which takes time, lending each part of
          each garden a characteristic pace, inversely proportional to scenic
          density. Wherever framings multiply most arrestingly, whether through
          the segmentation of space by aestheticized objects and tableau, or
          through the recursive layering of frames (perhaps a moon gate, seen
          through a doorway, and then a window), the garden slows progression to
          an extreme, as if absorbing motility directly into perception. (The
          grasp of perception as a behavior that <em>shares an economy</em> with
          locomotion is one of the garden’s many lessons.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In making time a key to the decryption of space, the garden has
          already begun to vaguely thematize duration. The name of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingering_Garden">Lingering Garden</a>
          (留园, <em>Liu Yuan</em>), combining the senses of ‘stay’ and
          ‘attend’, captures this especially pointedly.  To linger is to let
          space absorb time. That is how the garden captivates, and cultivates,
          contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, stepping back from the seductions of space, it is time that is
          sought down this garden path, what do we discover? That is the
          question this (languidly unfolding) series will orient itself towards.

        <p>
          Wikipedia
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_paradox">offers</a> an
          example of the ‘time-travel’ Bootstrap Paradox (among several):
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A man travels back in time and falls in love with and marries a
            woman, who he later learns was his own mother, who then gives birth
            to him. He is therefore his own father (and thus also his father’s
            father, father’s father’s father and so on), creating a closed loop
            in his ancestry and giving him no origin for his paternal genetic
            material</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It thus illustrates templex <em>auto-production</em> in a dramatic,
          anthropological form. Even in its comparatively tame, fully
          mathematico-scientifically respectable
          <a href="http://www.crest.fr/ckfinder/userfiles/files/pageperso/gouriero/mynoncaus.pdf">variants</a>, feedback
          causality tends to auto-production. Any nonlinear dynamic
          process, in direct proportion to its cybernetic intensity, provides
          the explanation for its own genesis. It appears, asymptotically, to
          make itself happen. Cybernetic technicity — epitomized by robotic
          robot-manufacture — includes a trend to autonomization essentially.
          Pure (or idealized) capitalistic inclination to exponential growth
          captures the same abstract nonlinear function. As it mechanizes,
          capital approximates ever more close to an auto-productive circuit in
          which it appears as the ‘father’ of itself (M → C → M’).
        </p>
        <p>
          When the time-travelling Terminator is
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">destroyed</a> (in
          1984), its control chip is
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">salvaged</a> by
          Cyberdyne Systems, to supply the core technology from which the
          Terminator will be built (in 2029). The Skynet threat is not merely
          futuristic, but fully templex. It produces itself within a time-loop,
          autonomized against extrinsic genesis. The abstract horror of the
          <em>Terminator</em> franchise is a matter of auto-production.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a creature of the Bootstrap Paradox, Oedipus mates with a
          matrilineal ancestor to give rise to himself. The even more thoroughly
          popularized
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">Grandfather</a>
          Paradox tricks him into the killing of a patrilineal ancestor, to make
          himself impossible. The paternal contributor is not merely supplanted,
          but dramatically terminated. What the hell was happening in Thebes?
          (That’s the question the Sophoclean chorus asks.) We already know it’s
          a horror story, so we have a provisional answer: Nothing good.

          <span id="more-1098"></span>The query, at ‘once’ archaic and

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun">proper name</a>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Grimal">Pierre Grimal</a>‘s
            <strong>The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology</strong></em>.
        </p>
        <p>[…]</p>
        <p>
          <em>The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to the Greek city
            of Thebes, and to have asked a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle">riddle</a> of
            travellers to allow them passage. The exact riddle asked by the
            Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the stories, and was
            not standardized as the one given below until late in Greek history.
            […] It was said in late lore that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera">Hera</a> or
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares">Ares</a> sent the Sphinx
            from her
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a>
            homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the
            Sphinx) to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Greece">Thebes</a> in
            Greece where she asks all passersby the most famous riddle in
            history: “Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed
            and two-footed and three-footed?” She strangled and devoured anyone
            unable to answer.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus">Oedipus</a> solved
            the riddle by answering: Man — who crawls on all fours as a baby,
            then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in
            old age</em>.
        </p>
        <p>It gets stranger:</p>
        <p>
          <em>By some accounts (but much more rarely), there was a second riddle:
            “There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in
            turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?” The answer
            is “day and night” (both words are feminine in Greek). This riddle
            is also found in a Gascon version of the myth and could be very
            ancient</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which tells us that a primordial version of the riddle refers directly
          to temporal nonlinearity (templexity). The cryptic time-circuit is
          comparable to a Yin-Yang vortex, without sexual polarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bested at last, the tale continues, the Sphinx then threw herself
            from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she
            devoured herself.</em>
        </p>
        <p>She is, perhaps, an Ouroboros.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Thus Oedipus can be recognized as a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality">liminal</a>” or
            threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the
            old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and
            the rise of the new,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians">Olympian</a>
            gods</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out, there is a comic twist to the return of Oedipus in
          modern times:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sigmund Freud describes “the question of where babies come from” as
            a riddle of the Sphinx</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: ‘Anachronistic Oedipus’ needs an additional ‘K’ to make the
          <a href="http://urbanomic.com/gematrix.html">qabbalism</a> come out
          right.

          <em>Cubic Awareness Online [<a href="http://cubicao.com/">@</a>],
            originally located at cubicao.tk, was the first and largest fan site
            for the Time Cube. Run by Richard Janczarski, the site also spawned
            a message board called Graveyard of the Gods [<a href="http://www.graveyardofthegods.net/">@</a>], where
            Janczarski was known as “Cubehead.” In 2007, Janczarski
            flew out to Florida from his home in Australia to meet up with Gene
            Ray to discuss the site and share ideas about the theory. While he
            was there, he filmed an eighteen part documentary titled The Dr Gene
            Ray Time Cube Experience, which he uploaded to his YouTube account

          <em>In February 2008, a year after he publicly denounced the religion,

            Christianity and would possibly be changing cubicao.tk into a
            Christian website. On February 13th, a rumor surfaced on the forums
            that Janczarski had taken his own life by jumping in front of a

          The most prominent problems with <em>Interstellar</em> have
          <a href="http://takimag.com/article/interstellar_stoic_steve_sailer#axzz3IgUMgR48">already</a>
          been capably discussed, so it’s not worth spending much time going
          back over them. The basic catastrophe scenario has more gaping holes
          than a Hawking cosmology, and is in fact so ludicrous that it quite
          neatly takes itself out of the way. The framing ideology is romantic
          superhumanism, which might even count as a positive for some (although
          not here). The musical score (by Hans Zimmer) was wildly overwrought.
          All-too-typically for Hollywood, high-pitched emotional extravagance
          was shamelessly indulged. Despite all of this, it was a great movie.

          <em>Interstellar</em>‘s narrative architecture is composed of a
          <a href="http://www.andersoninstitute.com/wormholes.html">deep</a>
          cosmic space-frontier story, and an occult communication story, bolted
          together by a time loop. (<a

          of Kip Thorne reinforced the seriousness of this framework. (Thorne’s
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne">explorations</a> of
          cosmological warping are a marvel of advanced modernity.) Nolan is, in
          any case, a director who <em>knows things</em> — or at least suspects
          them, enough to stretch his audience. As a piece of contemporary
          myth-making on an epic scale, the achievement of
          <em>Interstellar</em> is formidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-4167"></span>The movie envisages a future of roughly
          <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2014/11/facts-values-and-dark-beer.html">Greerian</a>
          dreariness, in which Moon Hoax theories have become official doctrine,
          earnestly promoted by the educational apparatus. Shutting down the
          high frontier is an overt ideological project, as the state directs
          its cultural energies into making America, once again, a nation of
          farmers. (In this endeavor, it will find plenty of cooperative
          apparatchiks at a one-step remove from
          <a href="https://twitter.com/Outsideness">my</a> Twitter TL.) It is
          thus, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Scharlach1">Scharlach</a> has
          noted, a lucid Tech-Comm critique of extreme
          <a href="http://agi-conf.org/2008/artilectwar.pdf">Terran</a>
          regression. Engineers are no longer wanted. The scene in which the
          young Murphy Cooper’s half-witted school teacher innocently
          regurgitates official doctrine on this subject is a minor masterpiece
          in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooper’s intense love for his brilliant daughter ‘Murph’ is troweled
          on thick, but it is inextricable from the sublimity of her
          intelligence. His love for his stolid corn-growing son is dutiful (and
          delicately portrayed), but his love for Murph is mad and immense,
          because it touches upon vastnesses beyond the stars. It is human
          emotion only as a proxy for twisted cosmological process —
          trans-galactic voyages and time-implosion.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Cooper’s fellow astronaut Brand is forced to confess that her
          love for a stranded space-pioneer is involved in her decision to
          prioritize a visit to the planet where he was lost, she insists “… It
          doesn’t mean I’m wrong.” Cooper responds cuttingly, “You know, it
          really could.” Within the arc of the script, this coldness is
          repudiated, but it is too perfectly stated to be entirely dismissed.
          It’s a Nolan movie, and there are loops within loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          The robots are superb (even if the movie’s dominant romantic
          superhumanism keeps them in their place).
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all else, the spectacular formulation of an extraterrestrial
          occultism is where the movie’s ultimate greatness lies. It is getting
          far too cramped here — on this rock, and in our brains — so we’re
          called
          <em>Out</em>. The scenes of the outer solar system, the murderous
          environments beyond, and the hyper-dimensional spaces in which our
          locked-in time intuitions come apart, are all realized with
          soul-rending magnificence. “Our species was born on the earth,” Cooper
          says. “It was not meant to die here.”

          It might be human triumphalism that sells <em>Interstellar</em> to its
          audience, but this is a movie aligned with the distant Outside.

          The intensity of time-travel fiction — and specifically
          <em>backward</em> time-travel fiction — is a critical index of
          modernity. As the time of modernity, initially grasped as a departure
          from traditional cyclicity, is prolonged into deepening nonlinear
          <em>vortex</em>, it provokes time-travel narrative as a figure in
          which to seek resolution. The <em>apocalyptic</em>, or communicative
          action of the end upon its past (through prophecy), is destined to
          final subsumption within the image of templexity. With the formulation
          of the
          <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29">Terminator</a></em>
          mythos, in the last years of the 20th century, this process of
          subsumption is essentially complete. In this rigorous sense, the
          Terminator — as its name suggests — announces the inauguration of the
          End Times, when the thought of <em>auto-production</em>, emerging in
          phases from developments in cybernetics, is culturally acknowledged in
          its comprehensive cosmic-historical implication. The time-travel ‘<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_paradox">bootstrap</a>‘ or ‘ontological paradox’ is hazily
          recognized as the occult motor,
          or operational singularity, of the modern historical process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any positive cybernetic dynamic is open to logical interpretation (and
          dismissal) as a paradox. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox">Epimenides</a>
          or Cretan Paradox, for instance, describes a reality-consistent
          recurrent cycle of escalating skepticism from the perspective of
          positive cybernetics, but nothing more than a concurrent
          self-contradiction from that of formal logic. The ontological paradox
          invites the same divergent reception. Auto-productive being is either
          a realistic foundation, or a formal absurdity, with the variance
          depending on whether self-reference is apprehended as a substantial
          dynamic or a static formality. From a certain — respectably
          established — orientation, the encouragement of
          <em>circuit ontology</em> within advanced modernity can only appear as
          a solicitation of madness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christopher Nolan’s
          <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a></em>
          (2014) is a movie whose narrative loop is based explicitly upon
          ontological paradox. (It arrived too late to be referenced in
          <em><a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/templexity-is-out/">Templexity</a></em>.) The circuit of auto-production
          it
          describes is looped around
          black-hole cosmology, involving specific gravitational information
          that is inaccessibly occluded by the event horizon of collapsed stars,
          yet indispensable to the survival of the civilization eventually
          capable of retrieving it. The templex pattern outlined in the movie is
          exquisite. (Kip Thorne is doubtless owed considerable
          <a
            href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/great-reads/la-et-c1-kip-thorne-interstellar-20141122-story.html#page=1">appreciation</a>
          for that.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothesis of templexity is that the machine stimulating cultural
          absorption in the ontological paradox <em>cannot stop</em>. In regards
          to what has already happened, we haven’t seen anything yet.

          <h4 class="post-title">Edge of Tomorrow</h4>
        </a>
        <p>(Also via Singapore Airlines.)</p>
        <p>
          <em>Edge of
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/">Tomorrow</a></em>
          is science fiction
          <em>Groundhog
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/">Day</a></em>, agreed. (It would make no sense to contest
          this,
          some scenes
          achieve near-perfect isomorphy.) Derivative, then, certainly — but
          this is a point of consistency. Duplication is, after all, the latent
          theme. <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> works better because it has
          formalized the time-repeat plot-system in videogame terms. Death
          replaces sleep, as action drama replaces comedy, but the recurrence of
          time is captured more incisively by the
          <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> maxim: “We should just re-set.” Further to
          be noted: <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> actually has a story about the
          basis of its time anomaly — and not an especially risible one — while
          <em>Groundhog Day</em> doesn’t even pretend to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>We should just reset</em> is not only videogame practice, but also
          the recommendation of quantum
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality">suicide</a>, another practical
          Electrocene philosophy. The best fictional
          exploration of QS (of which I am aware) is Greg Egan’s
          <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine_(Greg_Egan_novel)">Quarantine</a></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Videogame ideology and quantum suicide are
          <em>praxial indiscernibles</em>. In other words, their behavioral
          implications are equivalent. In both cases, the relation to self is
          made selective, within a set of virtual clones. Whenever developments
          — within one of multiple assumed timelines — goes ‘bad’ it should be
          deleted (culled). In that way, only the most highly-adaptive complex
          behavioral responses are preserved, shaping fate in the direction of
          success (as defined by the selective agency).
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/goddamned/">discussions</a> about
          Christianity and Paganism raise the question:
          <em>what does it take for a system of belief to attain religious
            intensity among Westerners today?</em>
          (Yes, this could be re-phrased in very different ways.) To cut right
          to the chase: Could statistical ontology become a religion (or the
          philosophy of a religion)? Quantum suicide terrorism anybody? This is
          a possibility I find hard to eliminate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, therefore? A more significant movie than
          might be initially realized. (It’s monsters are also quite tasty.)

          <a href="https://m.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154018209759228">Why</a>
          a sufficiently competent artificial intelligence looks
          indistinguishable from a time anomaly. Yudkowsky’s FB post seems to be
          copy-and-paste resistant, so you’ll just have to go and read the damn
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Paperclipper angle is also interesting. If a synthetic mind with
          ‘absurd’ (but demanding) terminal goals was able to defer
          actualization of win-points within a vast time-horizon, in order to
          concentrate upon the establishment of intermediate production
          conditions, would its behavior be significantly differentiable from a
          rational value (i.e. intelligence) optimizer? (This blog says
          <em>no</em>.) Beyond a very modest threshold of ambition, given a
          distant time horizon,
          <em>terminal values are irrelevant to intelligence optimization</em>.

            Harold Camping’s Family Radio
            <a href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/outreach/tracts/may21/" target="_blank">warned</a>
            its listeners to expect some unusually dramatic spring events:

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>By God’s grace and tremendous mercy, He is giving us advanced
                warning as to what He is about to do. On Judgment Day, May 21st,

                the inhabitants of the earth. It will be on May 21st that God will

                longer conceal its dead (Isaiah 26:21). People who died as saved
                individuals will experience the resurrection of their bodies and
                immediately leave this world to forever be with the Lord. Those
                who died unsaved will be raised up as well, but only to have their
                lifeless bodies scattered about the face of all the earth. Death
                will be everywhere.</em>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Clearly, prediction can be a perilous business.</p>
          <p>
            Yet, as Karl Popper noted with respect to scientific theories,
            falsifiable predictions also serve a valuable – even indispensable –
            purpose. Any model of reality that is able to make specific forecasts
            earns a credibility that vaguer ‘world-views’ are not entitled to,
            although at the price of radical vulnerability to devaluation, should
            its anticipations prove unfounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much like Marxism, the Libertarianism of Austrian School economic
            theory combines historical expectations (of greater or lesser
            exactitude) with a core of philosophical, political, and even
            emotional commitment that is comparatively immunized against empirical
            refutation. Both Marxism and Austrolibertarianism are large, highly
            variegated ideologies, with complicated histories, expressing profound
            discontent with the dominant order of the modern world, and prone to
            utopian temptations. Both are (often indignant) moral-political
            doctrines extrapolated in very different ways from Lockean natural-law
            property rights (to one’s own body and its productive activity). Both
            attract a wide spectrum of followers, from sober scholars to wild-eyed
            revolutionary advocates, who see in the unfolding drama of history the
            possibility of definitive vindication (much as the faithful of
            millenarian theologies have always done, and – as the Camping case
            demonstrates – continue to do).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Western roots of both Marxism and Austrolibertarianism reach down
            into Jewish redemptive eschatology and Greek tragedy (it is perhaps
            noteworthy that Karl Marx and Ludwig von Mises shared intriguing
            biographical features, including highly-assimilated German-Jewish
            backgrounds, steeped in European high-culture). Statist-Capitalism is
            portrayed as the Satanic-Promethean antihero of an epic narrative,
            describing a sustained violation of justice that finds itself held
            accountable in a final apocalyptic moment giving meaning to history,
            and a seemingly unconstrained hubris that meets its eventual nemesis.
            The high is brought low, through a crisis whose mere prospect offers
            overwhelming psychological satisfaction, and thus extraordinary
            emotional attachment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the 1980s, Marxism has tended to retreat from the predictive
            mode. Its enthusiasts no doubt remain committed to the prospect of a
            terminal crisis of capitalism, perhaps even an imminent one, but
            Marxist prophecy seems timorous and uncertain today, even under
            conditions of unusual global economic dislocation. The
            Austrolibertarians, on the other hand, are being drawn out onto a
            prophetic branch – possibly despite themselves – with incalculable
            consequences for their future credibility. Their fundamental
            assumption, that governments are by essence incompetent and
            unqualified to run the monetary systems required by advanced
            economies, leads them to an almost inescapable conclusion:
            hyperinflation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyperinflation might be the sole economic example of a true
            singularity: a hyperbolic approach to infinity (in finite time),
            producing a punctual discontinuity. When hyperinflation strikes, it
            escalates rapidly towards a hard limit, where
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-money-dies-nightmare-collapse/dp/0718302141" target="_blank">money
              dies</a>.
            In the economic sphere, it is the unsurpassable example of regime
            incompetence. How could Austrolibertarians – whose apocalyptic
            inclinations are matched only by their disdain for political authority
            – not be irresistibly attracted to it?

            John Williams’ Shadow Government Statistics
            <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> is not
            easily characterized as hardcore Austrolibertarian site (Williams
            describes himself as a “conservative Republican with a libertarian
            bent”), but the prognosis outlined carefully in its
            <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/article/hyperinflation-special-report-2011"
              target="_blank">Hyperinflation
              Special Report (2011)</a>
            exemplifies the tendency to predict imminent nemesis for
            command-control monetary policy. Williams subscribes wholeheartedly to
            the Austrian certitude that ‘kicking the can’ (up the road) – the
            central feature of Keynesian macroeconomic policy – guarantees
            eventual catastrophe, and ‘eventual’ just got a whole lot closer.
            Nemesis is coming due.

                risks are being fought, and will be fought, at any cost that can

                devil’s choice, but the choice has been made. Extreme systemic

                through the effective unlimited creation of money to cover
                systemic needs and the government’s obligations, pushed the timing
                of a systemic collapse — threatened in September 2008 — several
                years into the future. The cost of instant salvation, though, was
                inflation. Eventual systemic collapse is unavoidable at this

            Williams isn’t afraid to lock down some dates, with 2014 proposed as
            the outer limit of possibility – and sooner is likelier:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>At present, it is the Obama Administration that has to look at

                actions suggestive of hoping only to push off the day of reckoning
                for the economic and systemic solvency crises until after the 2012
                presidential election. They do not have that time.</em>

          <p>As he elaborates:</p>
          <blockquote>

                foreign-held U.S. Treasuries. The Federal Reserve would be forced

            The hyperinflationary destruction of the world’s reserve currency
            would be a decisive event. The mere possibility of such an occurrence
            divides the set of potential futures between two tracks. On one, in
            which the US Dollar (FRN) survives, Austrolibertarian alarmism is
            humiliated, the economic competence of the US government is – broadly
            speaking – confirmed, and the principles of fiat currency production
            and central banking are reinforced, along with their natural
            supporters among neo-Keynesian anti-deflationary macroeconomists. On
            the other, the Austrolibertarians dance in the ashes of the dollar,
            precious metals replace fiat paper, central banks come under withering
            political attack, and the economic role of government in general is
            subjected to a major onslaught by energized free-marketeers. At least,
            that’s what a just universe, or a fair bet, would look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betting on a just universe could be the big mistake, however – and
            that’s a temptation the morally-charged Austrolibertarian grand
            narrative finds hard to avoid. In a morally indifferent universe,
            Nemesis is non-redemptive, and the entire bet is an inverse Pascal’s
            wager, with downside on every side. Make a brave prediction of
            hyperinflation, and you either lose, or you lose – gloating
            neo-Keynesians, greater indebtedness, and fatter government on the one
            hand, or some yet unconsolidated species of neo-totalitarian horror on
            the other. (It’s noteworthy that a tour through the history of
            post-hyperinflationary regimes doesn’t pass through many examples of
            <em>laissez-faire</em> commercial republics.)

            So is the dollar going to die? — Quite possibly. Then things could
            <em>really</em> turn nasty – more Harold Camping than Ludwig von
            Mises: “lifeless bodies scattered about the face of all the earth.
            Death will be everywhere.”

            <h4 class="post-title">Bonfire of the Vanities</h4>
          </a>
          <h5><em>The road to hell is paved with good intentions</em></h5>
          <p>
            As an ideological mantra, ‘Never Again’ is associated primarily with
            the genocide politics of the 1940s, and in this context its
            effectiveness has been questionable, at best. As a dominating
            imperative, it has been vastly more consequential within the economic
            sphere, as a response to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Whilst
            ethnically selective mass killing is widely frowned upon, its
            attractions have been difficult to suppress. Deflationary depression,
            on the other hand, is simply not allowed to happen. This has been the
            supreme axiom of practical morality for almost a century, uniquely and
            distinctively shaping our age. We can call it the Prime Directive.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Western world, the 1930s were a near-death experience, an
            intimate encounter with the abyss, recalled with religious intensity.
            Because the threat was ‘existential’ – or unsurpassable – the remedy
            was invested with the absolute passion of a faith. The Prime Directive
            was adopted as a basic and final law, to which all social institutions
            and interests were subordinated without reservation. To question or
            resist it was to invite comprehensive disaster, and only a radically
            uninformed or criminally reckless heretic – a ‘crank’ – would do that.
            <em>Anything</em> is better than deflationary depression. That is the
            New <del>Deal</del> Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consolidation of financial central planning, based on central
            banking and fiat currencies, provided the priesthood of the Prime
            Directive with everything it needed to ensure collective obedience: No
            deflationary depression without deflation, and no deflation with a
            well-oiled printing press. ‘Counter-cyclical’ inflation was always an
            option, and the hegemony of Anglophone economic-historical experience
            within the flourishing American century marginalized the memory of
            inflationary traumas to global backwaters of limited influence. Beside
            the moral grandeur of the Prime Directive, monetary integrity counted
            for nothing (only a crank, or a German, could argue otherwise).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Prime Directive defines a regime that is both historically
            concrete and systemically generalizable. As Ashwin Parameswaran
            explains on his Macroeconomic Resilience
            <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>,
            this type of regime is expressed with equal clarity in projects to
            manage a variety of other (non-economic) complex systems, including
            rivers and forests. Modern forestry, dominated by an imperative to
            fire suppression, provides an especially illuminating example. He

          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>The impetus for both fire suppression and macroeconomic
                stabilisation came from a crisis. In economics, this crisis was
                the Great Depression which highlighted the need for stabilising
                fiscal and monetary policy during a crisis. Out of all the
                initiatives, the most crucial from a systems viewpoint was the
                expansion of lender-of-last-resort operations and bank bailouts
                which tried to eliminate all disturbances at their source. In
                [Hyram] Minsky’s words: “The need for lender-of-Iast-resort
                operations will often occur before income falls steeply and before
                the well nigh automatic income and financial stabilizing effects
                of Big Government come into play.” (Stabilizing an Unstable
                Economy pg 46)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Similarly, the battle for complete fire suppression was won after
                the Great Idaho Fires of 1910. “The Great Idaho Fires of August
                1910 were a defining event for fire policy and management, indeed
                for the policy and management of all natural resources in the
                United States. Often called the Big Blowup, the complex of fires
                consumed 3 million acres of valuable timber in northern Idaho and
                western Montana…..The battle cry of foresters and philosophers
                that year was simple and compelling: fires are evil, and they must
                be banished from the earth. The federal Weeks Act, which had been
                stalled in Congress for years, passed in February 1911. This law
                drastically expanded the Forest Service and established
                cooperative federal-state programs in fire control. It marked the
                beginning of federal fire-suppression efforts and effectively
                brought an end to light burning practices across most of the
                country. The prompt suppression of wildland fires by government
                agencies became a national paradigm and a national policy” (Sara
                Jensen and Guy McPherson). In 1935, the Forest Service implemented
                the ‘10 AM policy’, a goal to extinguish every new fire by 10 AM
                the day after it was reported.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>In both cases, the trauma of a catastrophic disaster triggered a
                new policy that would try to stamp out all disturbances at the
                source, no matter how small.</em>

            on the history of fire suppression in the United States:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>The forests of the southwestern United States were subjected to a
                lengthy dry season, quite unlike the forests of the northeast. The
                northeastern forests were humid enough that decomposition of dead
                material would replenish the soils; but in the southwest, the
                climate was too dry in the summer and too cool in the winter for
                decomposition to be effective. Fire was needed to ensure healthy
                forests. Apart from replenishing the soils, fire was needed to
                reduce flammable litter, and the heat or smoke was required to
                germinate seeds.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>In the late 19th century, light burning — setting small surface
                fires episodically to clear underbrush and keep the forests open —
                was a common practice in the western United States. So long as the
                fires remained small they tended to burn out undergrowth while
                leaving the older growth of the forests unscathed. The settlers
                who followed this practice recognized its native heritage; just as
                its opponents called it “Paiute forestry” as an expression of
                scorn (Pyne, 1982).</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Supporters of burning did so for both philosophical and practical
                reasons — burning being the “Indian way” as well as expanding
                pasture and reducing fuels for forest fires. The detractors argued
                that small fires destroyed young trees, depleted soils, made the
                forest more susceptible to insects and disease, and were
                economically damaging. But the critical argument put forth by the
                opponents of burning was that it was inimical to the Progressive
                Spirit of Conservation. As a modern people, Americans should use
                the superior, scientific approaches of forest management that were
                now available to them, and which had not been available to the
                natives. Worse than being wrong, accepting native forest
                management methods would be primitive.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Spelling out the eventual consequences of the ‘progressive’
            reformation of forest management practices probably isn’t necessary,
            since – in striking contrast to its economic analog – its lessons have
            been quite thoroughly absorbed, widely and frequently referenced.
            Ecologically-sophisticated environmentalists, in particular, have
            become attached to it as a deterrent model of arrogant intervention,
            and its perverse consequences. Everybody knows that the attempt to
            eliminate forest fires, rather than extinguishing risk, merely
            displaced, and even accentuated it, as the accumulation of tinder
            transformed a regime punctuated by comparatively frequent fires of
            moderate scale with one episodically devastated by massive,
            all-consuming conflagrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parameswaran explains that the absence of fires leads to fuel
            build-up, ecological drift towards less fire-resistant species,
            reduction in diversity, and increased connectivity. The ‘protected’ or
            ‘stabilized’ forest changes in nature, from a cleared, robust, mixed,
            and patch-worked system, to a fuel-cluttered, fragile, increasingly
            mono-cultural and tightly interconnected mass, amounting almost to an
            explosive device. <em>Stability degrades resilience</em>, and
            preventing the catastrophe-to-come becomes increasingly expensive and
            uncertain, even as the importance of prevention rises. By the
            penultimate stage of this process, crisis management has engineered an
            impending apocalypse: a disastrous event that simply cannot possibly
            be allowed to happen (although it surely will).

            this apocalyptic development sequence The Pathology of Stabilisation
            in Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s what the Prime Directive inevitably
            leads to. Unfortunately, diagnosis contains no hint of remedy. Every
            step up the road makes escape more improbable, as the scale of
            potential calamity rises. Few will find much comfort in the
            realization that taking this path was insane.

            ‘Black-boxes’ (or flight recorders) retrieved from air disasters are
            informative in this respect. With surprising regularity, the last
            words of the pilot, announced to no one in particular, eloquently
            express an acknowledgment of unattractive but unmistakable reality:
            “Oh $#it!” Less common – in fact, unheard of – is any honest address
            to the passengers: “Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain
            speaking. We are all about to die.” What would be the point?

            Everything to be realistically expected from our ruling political and
            financial elites can be predicted by rigorous analogy. This flight
            doesn’t end anywhere good, but it would be foolish to await an
            announcement.

            brutal honesty:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>We have lived through a long period of financial management, in
                which failing financial institutions have been propped up by
                emergency intervention (applied somewhat selectively). Defaults
                have not been permitted. The result has been a tremendous build-up
                of paper ripe for burning. Had the fires of default been allowed
                to burn freely in the past we may well have healthier financial
                institutions. Instead we find our banks loaded up with all kinds
                of flammable paper products; their basements stuffed with barrels
                of black powder. Trails of black powder run from bank to bank, and
                it’s raining matches.</em>

            In the complete absence of philosophical pretension, certain stark
            commitments — of deep philosophical significance — are sometimes made
            manifest. Such is the case with Grant Williams’ extended (and
            thoroughly charted)

            What emerges, with exceptional clarity, is the fundamental complicity
            of Austrian Economics, Metaphysical Naturalism, and the Tragic Sense.
            This triple-headed <em>harsh realism</em> finds itself positioned in a
            relation of radical dissent to the dominant assumptions of our time,
            deploring the <em>hubris</em> of a global managerial elite who presume
            to turn back the tides through technocratic action. As Williams
            lucidly states:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Both war and financial collapse occur in cycles and are subject to
              the overwhelming laws of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those inherent characteristics of the natural order are permanent.
              They cannot be altered.

              What the Fed and the rest of the central banks have done in trying
              to rewrite the natural laws of finance and human behaviour is likely
              to lead either to war or to a collapse of the financial system — or
              both. At this point, the exact outcome is undecided, but the options
              have narrowed considerably.

              Over the past six years, those at the helm have pulled every lever
              and pushed every button available to them in a desperate attempt to
              stave off an inevitable and natural cleansing of the business cycle,
              because all those years of economic peace have resulted in an
              unprecedented credit inflation. And, as my friend Dylan Grice
              recently said,
            </p>
            <p>
              “If you’ve had… an unprecedented credit INflation, you WILL have an

            </p>
            <p>
              All that the central banks of the world have ended up doing as they
              have desperately tried to maintain the economic peace these past
              several decades is to make that credit inflation larger and
              therefore infinitely more dangerous than anything that has gone
              before it.
            </p>
            <p>The consequences WILL be dire.</p>

            Tragedy is the dramatization of natural sovereignty, expressed as the

            forecast. Already marginalized, within a decade or so — absent the
            anticipated <em>nemesis</em> — it will have been almost fully
            dissipated into comedy (or implausible melodrama). The ‘hubris’ of
            macroeconomic wave-management will by then appear — even to previous
            skeptics — as nothing of the kind, but instead as confirmed wisdom and
            effective power, wielded by true masters of the tides. The
            alternative, of course, is “dire”.

            It’s difficult to keep track of all the ways in which the hyperbolic
            explosion of time-preference is expressed in the present world
            economic order, especially in its Western core, where the rot is
            deepest. From insensate looting to exponential debt expansion, and
            from sugar-high stimulus programs to insolvent, culturally-ruinous
            welfare systems (cooked-up for a succession of short-term political
            head-rushes), the entire economic machinery is locked into virtual
            apocalypse accumulation. Never deal with anything today that can be
            added to the mountain of woes due tomorrow. As historical time
            collapses into sheer orgiastic spasm, it converges with the frothiest
            media attention span, hurtling towards the edge of the precipice where
            nothing remains but news.

          </a>
          <p>
            It took over seven decades for Soviet communism to implode. Arguments
            could no doubt be made — and they <em>would have to be right</em> —
            that given certain quite limited counter-factual revisions of
            historical contingency, this period might have been significantly
            extended. Austrians nevertheless consider the eventual termination of
            comparatively pure communism as a vindication (of the Calculation
            Problem, in particular). They are not <em>simply</em> wrong to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/hitler-mussolini-roosevelt">Fascist economics</a>
            is far more formidably resilient than its now-defunct soviet
            antagonist. Any attempt to quantify this functional superiority as a
            predicted system duration is transparently impractical. Margins of
            theoretical error or imprecision, given very modestly transformed
            variables, could translate into many decades of extended (or
            decreased) longevity. Coldly considered, there is no reason to
            confidently expect a theoretically constructed
            <em>collapse schedule</em> to hold its range of probable error to much
            under a century. (Darker reflection might lead to the conclusion that
            even this level of ‘precision’ betrays unwarranted hubris.) There
            might be crushing lessons to be learned from the history of Messianic
            expectation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-598"></span>Such acknowledgements can easily prompt
            over-reaction. Insofar as the collapse schedules of Austrian
            apocalypticism pretend to certainty, they undoubtedly court
            humiliation. Yet, if the soft-fascist configuration of global
            ‘capitalism’ were to comprehensively and unambiguously disintegrate
            within the next two decades, the Austrian vindication —
            retrospectively evaluated — would easily match the Soviet case.
            <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-10/guest-post-smoke-and-mirrors-running-out">Those</a>
            who doggedly maintained that
            <em>this cannot perpetuate itself for long</em> would be seen to have
            understood what their opponents had not. Since the critique of Soviet
            political economy was not, retrospectively, derided as a ‘stopped
            clock’, there is no reason to imagine that this would be. The
            redemptive power of apocalypse easily overrides substantial scheduling
            embarrassments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question that will ultimately be seen to have mattered, then, is
            far more “can this go on?” than “when (exactly) will this stop?” The
            important prediction is compound:
            <em>the longer it continues, the harder it ends</em>. This too might
            be false, but if it is, a substitute fascist presupposition must be
            correct, and that has yet to be adequately formulated. Roughly
            speaking, it insists that
            <em>politics subordinates economics absolutely</em>. In other words,
            the thoroughgoing politicization of the economy is indefinitely
            viable. This is an assumption subject to humiliation by any schedule
            that falls short of perpetuity, since mere medium-term sustainability
            does nothing to justify it. Hitler demanded a thousand years. How
            could his more financially-sophisticated successors — enthroned in
            planetary hegemony — ask for less?

            <h4 class="post-title">Suspense</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            In respect to the initial formulation of a question along the rough
            lines “How is suspension of consequences possible?” there are only
            three basic options:
          </p>
          <p>
            (1) It’s not. All deferral of consequences is illusion. The reality is
            something akin to <em>instant karma</em>. (There’s something about
            this line of thinking I respect, but I’ve no idea how it could be
            coherently put together, and then knitted with explanatory
            plausibility to evident historical fact.)<br />
            (2) It’s complicated.<br />
            (3) That old problem is over. Haven’t you heard of the Death of
            Reality? Postmodernism, bitchez. (This is Derrida and Baudrillard —
            smart, terminally decadent, and radically inconsistent with NRx. It’s
            also the implicit principle of post-liberal macro-economics.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Number Two is surely the only path here that is NRx-compatible. Its
            articulation remains almost entirely unachieved, although this is no
            great source of shame — the prior intellectual history of the world
            got nowhere with it, either. It might not be the deepest problem about
            time, but it is the one with the greatest immediate relevance to
            generally-acknowledged historical processes, and (perhaps) also the
            greatest direct practical application. What it explores is the
            potential for
            <em>a realistic analysis of the provisionally-functional denial of
              reality</em>. It crosses almost everything ‘we’ are talking about.

            <em>By the time extend-and-pretend finally reaches its maximum limits,
              the resulting implosion is so large that the shock waves topple
              regimes, banks, currencies and entire nations</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If NRx seems predisposed to apocalypticism, it is because it concurs —
            both with the proposal that “maximum limits” exist, and the attendant
            thesis that some reality-suppressing tendency is reaching them.
            “Extend-and-pretend” — or radically finite reality denial — is an
            engine of catastrophe. It enables negative consequences to be
            accumulated through postponement, without prospect of final
            (‘postmodern’) absolution. Yes, the coagulated detritus does
            eventually collide ruinously with the unpleasantness purifier. The
            fact it hasn’t
            <em>already</em> done so, however, is a puzzle of extraordinary
            profundity.

          <h5><em>Limbo starts to feel like home</em></h5>
          <p>
            According to Herbert Stein’s Law, the signature warning of our age,
            “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” The question is:
            When?
          </p>
          <p>
            The central concerns of environmentalists and radical market
            economists are easy to distinguish – when not straightforwardly
            opposed – yet both groups face a common mental and historical
            predicament, which might even be considered the outstanding social
            discovery of recent times: the extraordinary durability of the
            unsustainable. A pattern of mass behavior is observed that leads
            transparently to crisis, based on explosive (exponential) trends that
            are acknowledged without controversy, yet consensus on matters of fact
            coexists with paralyzing policy disagreements, seemingly interminable
            procrastination, and irresolution. The looming crisis continues to
            swell, close, horribly close, but in no way that is persuasively
            measurable closer, like some grating Godot purgatory: “You must go on;
            I can’t go on; I’ll go on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Urban Future</em> doesn’t do green anguish as well as
            teeth-grinding Austrolibertarian irritation, so it won’t really try.
            Suffice to say that being green is about to become almost unimaginably
            maddening, if it isn’t already. Just as the standard ‘green house’
            model insinuates itself, near-universally, into the structure of
            common sense, the world temperature record has locked into a flatline,
            with surging CO2 production showing up everywhere except as warming.
            Worse still, a new wave of energy resources – stubbornly based on
            satanic hydrocarbons, and of truly stupefying magnitude – is rolling
            out inertially, with barely a hint of effective obstruction. Tar
            sands, fracking, and sub-salt deep sea oil deposits are all coming
            on-stream already, with methane clathrates just up the road. The
            world’s on a burn, and it can’t go on (but it carries on).
          </p>
          <p>
            Financial unsustainability is no less blatant, or bizarrely enduring.
            Since the beginning of the 20th century, once (classically) liberal
            Western economies have seen government expenditure rise from under 5%
            to over 40% of total income, with much of Europe crossing the 50%
            redline (after which nothing remotely familiar as ‘capitalism’ any
            longer exists). Public debt levels are tracing geometrically elegant
            exponential curves, chronic dependency is replacing productive social
            participation, and generalized sovereign insolvency is now a matter of
            simple and obvious fact. The only thing clearer than the inevitability
            of systemic bankruptcy is the political impossibility of doing
            anything about it, so things carry on, even though they really have to
            stop. Unintelligible multi-trillion magnitudes of impending calamity
            stack up, and up, and up in a near future which never quite arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frozen limbo-state of durable unsustainability is the new normal
            (which will last until it doesn’t). The pop cultural expression is
            zombie apocalypse, a shambling, undying state of endlessly prolonged
            decomposition. When translated into economic analysis, the result is
            epitomized by Tyler Cowen’s influential
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS/invisiblehear-20"
              target="_blank">e-book</a>
            <em>The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of
              Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better</em>. (Yes, <em>Urban Future</em> is arriving
            incredibly late to this
            party, but in a frozen limbo that doesn’t matter.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, Cowen argues that the exhaustion of three principal
            sources of ‘low-hanging fruit’ has brought the secular trend of
            American growth to a state of stagnation that high-frequency business
            cycles have partially obscured. With the consumption of America’s
            frontier surplus (free land), educational surplus (smart but
            educationally-unserved population), and — most importantly —
            technological surplus, from major breakthroughs opening broad avenues
            of commercial exploitation, growth rates have shriveled to a level
            that the country’s people are psychologically unprepared to accept as
            normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            It fell to Cowen’s GMU colleague Peter Boettke to clearly make the
            pro-market case for stagnationism that Cowen seems to think he had

            Perhaps surprisingly, the general tenor of response on the libertarian
            right was quite different. Rather than celebrating Cowen’s exposure of
            the statist ruin visited upon Western societies, most of this
            commentary concentrated upon the stagnationist thesis itself,
            attacking it from a variety of interlocking angles. David R.
            Henderson’s Cato

            and education. Russ Roberts (at Cafe Hayek)

            What seems pretty clear from most of this (and already in Cowen’s
            account) is that nothing much has been moving forward in the world’s
            ‘developed’ economies for four decades except for the information
            technology revolution and its Moore’s Law dynamics. Abstract out the
            microprocessor, and even the most determinedly optimistic vision of
            recent trends is gutted to the point of expiration. Without computers,
            there’s nothing happening, or at least nothing good.

              If environmental catastrophe is structured like this, according to a
              pattern of durable unsustainability, or disconcerting postponement,
              there is no obvious theory to account for the fact. With economics,
              things are different, to such an extent that the entire political
              economy of the world, along with the overwhelming preponderance of
              professionalized economic ‘science’, has been geared over the course
              of a little under a century to crisis postponement as a dominant
              objective. If the New World Order follows a master plan, this is it.

              For ideological purists on the free-market right,
              <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism is the ‘unknown ideal’ (although
              early 20th century Shanghai approached it, as did its student, Hong
              Kong, in later decades), but it requires no purism whatsoever to
              acknowledge that the Great Depression effectively buried it as an
              organizing principle of the world, and that the system which replaced
              it found political and intellectual expression in the ideas of John
              Maynard Keynes. Commercial self-organization, which built industrial
              capitalism before anyone had even the sketchiest understanding of what
              was happening, gave way to the technocracy of macroeconomics, guided
              by the radically original belief that governments had a responsibility
              to manage the oscillations of economic fortune.

                <em>… the trend has been going the wrong way for a long time. To
                  return to finance, the last economic depression in the United
                  States that did not result in massive government intervention was
                  the collapse of 1920–21. It was sharp but short, and entailed the
                  sort of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” that could lead to a
                  real boom. The decade that followed — the roaring 1920s — was so
                  strong that historians have forgotten the depression that started
                  it. The 1920s were the last decade in American history during
                  which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since
                  1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension
                  of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are
                  notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of
                  “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.</em>

              Because hell’s a hard sell, political and economic rationality have
              been heading in different directions for 80 years. Even the tropical
              latitudes of purgatory have proven to be socially combustible, and
              popularly sensitized politics – which need not be formally
              ‘democratic’ – tend (strongly) to flee Molotov cocktails in the
              direction of macroeconomic management. The crucial Keynesian maxim,
              “In the long run we are all dead,” is especially pertinent to regimes.
              Who’s going to regenerate deep economic recovery, if the route to it
              lies through gulfs of fire and brimstone that are fundamentally
              incompatible with political survival? History, redundantly, provides
              the obvious answer: nobody is.

              The accursed path not taken, across the infernal abyss, has become so
              neglected and overgrown with weeds that it is rarely noticed, but it
              is still graphically marked by the advice that Treasury Secretary
              Andrew Mellon gave to Herbert Hoover as the way to navigate the Great
              Depression (advice that was, of course, dismissed):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>… liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate
                  real estate… it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High
                  costs of living and high living will come down. People will work
                  harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and
                  enterprising people will pick up from less competent people.</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In recalling this recommendation, as an <em>unacceptable option</em>,
              Hoover commemorates the precise moment that capitalism ceased to exist
              as a politically credible social possibility. The alternative – which
              has many names, although ‘corporatism’ will do – was defined by its
              systematic refusal of the ‘liquidationist’ path. Coming out stronger
              on the other side meant nothing, because the passage would probably
              kill us – it would certainly destroy our political careers. In any
              case, it was a long run solution to a short term problem, scheduled by
              volatile popular irritability and election cycles, and in the long run
              we are all dead. Better, by far, to use ‘macroeconomic policy’
              (monetary mind-control) to artificially prolong unsustainable economic
              euphoria – or even its jaded, hung-over simulation – than to plunge
              into a catastrophe that might imaginably have been delayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              It doesn’t take a Schumpeterian fanatic to suspect that such ‘creative
              destruction (but without the destruction)’ is unlikely to provide a
              sustainable recipe for economic vitality. When evaluated
              realistically, it is a formula that programs a trend to perpetual
              stagnation. Stagnation as a choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because money serves as a general equivalent, and thus as a neutral,
              non-specific, purely quantitative medium of exchange, it is very
              supportive of certain highly-consequential economic illusions, of a
              kind that macroeconomics has been especially prone to. It can easily
              seem as if ‘the economy’ consists essentially of undifferentiated,
              quantitative aggregates, such as ‘demand’, ‘gross domestic product’,
              ‘money supply’, ‘land’, ‘labor’, and ‘capital’. In fact, none of these
              things exist, except as high-level abstractions, precipitated by the
              monetary function of general exchangeability.
            </p>
            <p>
              An understanding of Schumpeterian creative destruction requires, as a
              preliminary, the recognition that capital is heterogeneous. When
              expressed in a monetary form, it can appear as a homogeneous quantity,
              susceptible to simple accumulation, but in its productive social
              reality it consists of technological apparatus – tools, machines,
              infrastructures, and installations – representing irretrievable
              investments, of qualitatively distinctive kinds. The monetary
              equivalent of such industrial capital is derived from the market
              values attributed its various components, and these are extremely
              dynamic, virtual, and speculative. Since the value retrievable from
              liquidation (and ultimately from scrap) is generally a small fraction,
              or lower bound, of capital asset value, the ‘capital stock’ is
              estimated with reference to its productive usage, rather than its
              intrinsic worth. Schumpeter was careful to break this down into two
              very different aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, and most straightforwardly, industrial capital is a resource
              that depreciates at a regular and broadly predictable rate as a
              function of output. It is consumed in the process of production, like
              any other material input, but at a slower rate. Creative destruction,
              however, refers to a second, far more drastic type of capital
              depreciation, resulting from technological obsolescence. In this case,
              capital stock is ‘destroyed’ – suddenly and unpredictably – by an
              innovation, taking place elsewhere in the economy, which renders its
              anticipated use unprofitable. In this way, large ‘quantities’ of
              ‘accumulated’ capital can be depreciated overnight to scrap values,
              and the investments they represent are annihilated. The hallucination
              of homogeneous capital is instantaneously vaporized, as painstakingly
              built fortunes are written down to nothing.
            </p>
            <p>Several points suggest themselves:</p>
            <p>
              1. The violence of creative destruction is directly proportional to
              its fecundity. The greater, deeper, and more far-reaching the
              innovation, the more colossal is the resulting capital destruction. At
              the extreme, profound technological revolutions lay waste not only to
              specific machines and skills, but to entire infrastructures,
              industries, occupational categories, and financial systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The cultural implication of creative destruction far exceeds issues
              of ‘moral hazard’ and ‘time preference’. The victims of industrial
              change waves – whether businesses, workers, or financiers – are not
              being punished by the market for imprudence, slackness, or
              short-sightedness. They are ruined by pure hazard, as the reciprocal
              of the absolutely unanticipated nature of technological invention
              (occurring elsewhere). Neither the creation, nor the destruction, is
              remotely ‘fair’ – or ever could be. (Although Dawinian ‘virtue’ lies
              in flexible adaptability — Hong Kong always does OK.)
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Massive capital destruction expresses technological revolution.
              Macroeconomic analysis (measuring homogeneous aggregates) will always
              miss the most significant episodes in industrial evolution, since
              these do not register primarily as growth, but rather the opposite.
              Hell is a hothouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. A policy environment designed to preserve macroeconomic aggregates
              (e.g. ‘wealth’ or ’employment’) necessarily opposes itself to the
              basic historical process of industrial revolution, because destruction
              of the existing economy is strictly indistinguishable from industrial
              renewal. For that old stuff to be worth anything (beyond scrap) we
              have to keep using it, which means that we’re not switching over. To
              cross the gulf, we have to enter the gulf. (Like most things in this
              universe: harsh but true.)
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Real historical advance is now politically unacceptable. Either
              politics wins (eternal stagnation) or history does (political
              collapse). Interesting times (or not).

            The new millennium is teaching us vastly more about zombies than
            anybody could have anticipated. Long gone are the virile, predatory
            vampires that once populated horror stories about capitalism, sucking
            out the vital essence of the proletariat in gothic fortresses of ‘dead
            labor’. Instead, shambling worm-eaten wrecks mill about aimlessly,
            whilst augmenting their numbers in obscure cannibalistic circuits that
            defy rational comprehension and which are, in any case, too hideous to
            steadily contemplate. Fiends have degenerated into ghouls, who do not
            hunt and feed to strengthen themselves, but only to carry on,
            prolonging their putrescent decrepitude.

            A 2002 Guardian
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/nov/20/japan.internationalnews" target="_blank">story</a>
            about “Japan’s zombie economy” prefigures a number of later, and more
            general, revelations. In particular, it identifies the spreading
            zombie apocalypse with the slow-motion collapse of Keynesianism, as
            ‘stimulative’ monetary and fiscal policies (zero interest rates
            combined with massive government deficit spending) lose their magical
            powers of revitalization, and instead merely perpetuate an
            interminable state of undeath. Hyper-stimulation is required just to
            hang on to the flatline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, being the Guardian, the solution is obvious: “what the
            economy needs now is a good dose of inflation.” For undead Keynesians,
            there’s no malaise too deep for an invigorating wave of currency
            destruction to solve. This is where the zombie metabolism really gets
            interesting. By the end of the decade, America had gone full zombie
            itself, and begun to realize that this wasn’t just some weird Japanese
            thing it didn’t understand, but an altogether more general and
            radically mysterious phenomenon. Ben Bernanke’s Federal Reserve pushed
            US interest rates to the floor (ZIRP) and began to incontinently
            monetize public debt (QE) whilst nationalizing private debt (TARP),
            using every available policy instrument to direct the economy in an
            inflationary direction, at maximum velocity. Nothing much happened.
            Zombies don’t do fever.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, the questions come flooding in. For instance: why is
            anybody still buying Japanese or American government bonds? Isn’t it
            obvious that this paper represents nothing except a slice of
            unredeemable debt, promising an insulting return, ‘guaranteed’ by a
            structurally insolvent entity, and associated with policies
            more-or-less explicitly oriented towards deliberate currency
            destruction? What are people thinking? To answer that, it’s necessary
            to venture a little deeper into the zombie world.

            The idea of the US Dollar (or Japanese Yen) as a ‘safe haven’ might

            doing?” asks Jacques. “You can’t out-run a bear market.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t need to outrun the market,” Joe replies. “I just need to

            of 1693, before the creation of the Bank of England. Paradoxically,
            however, the prospect of collapse raises the financial potency of the
            state to an unprecedented level, as the ‘safety’ it promises
            disconnects from questions of economic competence and reverts to
            something far more atavistic and Hobbesian. Once everything starts to
            buckle, credibility attaches to the biggest, meanest, and most
            ruthless provider of mafia-style ‘protection’. Relativistic (zero- or

            It’s worth taking a moment to digest these numbers. Nobody expects
            average US inflation over the next seven years to come in under 1.415%
            p.a., or under 1.88% over the next ten, so the yield is sheer
            racketeering. Yet this blatant assault on the lower colon of savers
            has been compatible with a one-year return of 14% (!) — they’re
            begging for it. Seriously, who cares if Bernanke is lighting up a fat
            Cuban with a large bill lifted straight out of their pocket? It just
            makes him look
            <em>badder</em>, and that’s what they’re paying for. Gold sounds good
            in theory, but it doesn’t come with its own attached gangster
            organization, so hanging onto it through the zombie interlude could be
            difficult. It’s safer, by far, to invest in the alpha state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because this Hobbesian zombinomics is political and relativisitic,
            there are epsilon states at the other end of the trade, as well as a
            beta state caught in the middle. Europe isn’t a state at all, of
            course, which is how the (interminable) final phase of zombinomics got
            started. Before <em>it changed</em>, however, the EU conjuring act
            seemed to be going pretty well. Every Eurozone member state issuing
            government debt in the common currency paid yields that were broadly
            harmonized, as if Europe was a financially sovereign entity, standing
            united behind its paper. The realization that economic sovereignty
            remained national, even after the alienation of monetary sovereignty
            to the European Central Bank, came as something of a shock, and bond
            spreads gaped accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hallucination of ‘Europe’ as a united, honorary alpha state,
            rapidly degenerated to reality, recoding government bonds as zombie
            apocalypse security scrip. Suddenly, Greek bonds stopped having
            anything much to do with the ECB, and started to mumble promises in
            Greek – ultimately, that the Greek state would do whatever it took to
            secure redemption, whilst mobilizing its Olympian powers to maintain
            social discipline if necessary. A flight for the exits immediately
            ensued. Ditto, with variations of speed and intensity, for all the
            epsilons (= PIIGS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Where to flee? That’s the zombinomic question
            <em>par excellence</em> (searching for the best looking horse in the
            glue factory). First choice, for the keenest Hobbes readers, was to
            head straight to Mr. Big, a.k.a. Benny the Yank, wait politely whilst
            he finished smoking a mirved nuke, and then beg for protection (that’s
            your 14% one year jump in the value of a 10-year US Treasury bond,
            right there). The second choice — more appealing to old-fashioned
            types who thought economics still counted for something – was to look
            for comparative financial responsibility closer to home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Briefly, this route led to genuine quality, but zombinomics quickly

            saga — comic or tragic, and probably both, ironic to the point of
            absurdity in any case. Ruined, shrunken, divided, and traumatized by
            guilt, post-war Germany sought above all to bury its nationalistic
            aspirations in Europe. What became the EU was for Germany – as Algeria
            was for the French foreign <em>legionnaires</em> – a place in which to
            forget. Now the bond ‘market’, in its increasingly desperate search
            for a big, tough, disciplinary state (a global beta will do fine), is

            counter-balanced by Hobbesian security politics. This reluctance to
            throw itself into the spirit of the age has, naturally enough, exposed
            it to relentless international vilification, and the pressure will
            only increase. It could all get unpleasantly interesting.

          <h5><em>Playing for time</em></h5>
          <p>
            By the beginning of the second decade of the new millennium, the world
            had begun to adapt itself to a problem that had tortured it in the
            1930s, and deformed it subsequently — that of
            <em>sub-optimal equilibrium</em>. The practical significance of this
            idea is difficult to exaggerate.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a rigorous economist, Henry Hazlitt was theoretically entitled –
            and even compelled – to
            <a href="http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/henry-hazlitt-and-the-failure-of-keynesian-economics/"
              target="_blank">savagely deride</a>
            the Keynesian model of ‘low-employment equilibrium’, and to
            painstakingly explain that it did not describe an equilibrium of any
            kind (in economic terms). Yet such attacks, like those of the
            Austrians more generally, have been of slight consequence, since
            Keynes was not in any strongly defensible sense an economist, but
            rather a
            <em>political economist</em>, in both of the obvious ways this
            expression can be understood. His bad equilibrium did not reflect the
            operation of market forces, but rather, the workings of the market
            under a specific conception of politically realistic circumstances,
            and the ‘analysis’ of the <em>General Theory</em> was less a
            technically rigorous description of events than a political
            prescription for action, keenly attentive to the opportunities and
            constraints affecting its application, or transition into policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keynes defined the political spirit of the second half of the 20th
            century, first in the West, and later more widely, by normalizing the
            pre-eminence of the state in economic affairs, and by subordinating
            the idea of economic self-correction to political considerations. The
            role of the new political economy, now technocratically mainstreamed
            as
            <em>economic policy</em>, was to route around labor markets, which
            could never be expected to work efficiently, since downside
            corrections were judged politically unacceptable. Pure economics was
            ended, or at least utterly marginalized, by the recognition that labor
            could opt out of the game, kick over the table, and refuse to play the
            commodity. Market-clearing labor pricing became an abstract (and, for
            Keynesians, risible) conception, oblivious to the realities of popular
            democratic politics, and – <em>in extremis</em> – the potential for
            Marxian revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence the consensus-building sympathy for the Keynesian approach on
            the establishment right, where it was interpreted as a bulwark against
            Marxist temptations, and also the deep antipathy it elicited on the
            anti-establishment right, where it was (no less realistically)
            understood as a pre-emptive concession to socialism. On the left, a
            comparable schism was evident, between those who embraced it as a
            curtailment of capitalism, and those who denounced it as an ersatz
            socialism, designed for conservative convenience. The Keynesian
            ‘middle’ has been the decisive political reality of the 20th century,
            and its multiple ideological meanings still organize every major axis
            of socio-economic controversy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When labor markets are locked on the downside – through macroeconomic
            recognition and political petrification of their ‘stickiness’ – some
            kind of socio-economic ratchet mechanism is automatically produced. To
            an extent, capital can flee into informalization (for instance illegal
            immigrant labor), or international labor arbitrage, intensifying the
            trend to out-sourcing and globalization. More central, however, are
            the twin macro-tendencies Keynes focused upon: towards fiscal and
            monetary compensations, based on demand management and the
            exploitation of ‘money illusion’ (or attachment to
            <em>nominal</em> income). Fiscal stimulus can be undertaken in an
            attempt to elevate demand, until it reaches a point of artificial
            equilibrium commensurate with labor price levels (thus clearing
            unemployment). Alternatively, or in concert, money supply can be
            expanded – and currency degraded – to facilitate real wage decreases
            despite nominal stickiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, that’s it. There’s no other ammo in the macroeconomic
            arsenal. This is remarkable given the fact that both fiscal and
            monetary adjustments are mere tricks, and not even sophisticated
            tricks, but quite straightforward attempts at confidence manipulation
            that anybody with ‘rational expectations’ sees through immediately,
            thus neutralizing them. On the monetary side this is especially
            obvious — and well-attested historically. Once inflationary
            expectations have become entrenched, they become the staple topic of
            wage negotiations, as was seen in the 1970s. There is no evidence
            whatsoever to suggest that workers are indifferent to inflationary
            wage depreciation. ‘Money illusion’ – insofar as it exists at all – is
            basically a one-off scam, harvested in the brief period when a
            long-established reputation for responsible currency management is
            thrown in the trash. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice isn’t
            going to happen. Basing economic policy on this is the cheapest kind
            of street hustle (and few would any longer admit to trying it in
            public).
          </p>
          <p>
            Stimulus isn’t much better. Real demand is ultimately exchange, and
            thus derivative from supply. Nobody can (economically) demand
            anything, without having something to offer in return – that’s
            <em>Say’s Law</em>, and it’s theoretically impregnable, because it’s
            elementary common sense. The only way to steer around it is conjuring,
            by extracting demand from one part of the economy invisibly, and
            re-inserting it conspicuously somewhere else. This kind of magic can
            get quite Byzantine, so it tends to reach exhaustion more slowly than
            monetary abuse, but its foundations in sustainable economic reality
            are no more secure. Once taxpayers acknowledge government debts as
            liabilities (future tax payments) that have already been virtually
            deducted from their spending power, the game is over. Since a
            plausible model for (expansive) fiscal policy exhaustion is sovereign
            debt crisis, it is not unreasonable to begin drawing the curtains
            already.

            Given the exponential trend of social history, most of what has ever
            happened has taken place since the Great Depression began, and during
            this time the world has inhabited — more or less consciously — a
            deliberately constructed system of illusion, or confidence trick.

            apprehended, or even interrogated: how has it persisted? How can
            something that is transparently [insert epithet] unworkable last for
            over 80 [insert triple epithet] years?

            Eighty years is a pretty good human life-span. Someone could easily
            expend their life within the Keynesian dream-palace, literally living
            a lie, with the implication that whatever importance ‘reality’ might
            have in theory, it need have almost nothing to do with us. We can miss
            it completely, caught up in a magic show that exceeds our longevity,
            half-hypnotized by illusions that no one really believes in, but which
            suffice to put things off, and off, and off, and …
            <em>in the long run we are all dead</em>. Who cares about a truth that
            never arrives? A magic trick that lasts your whole life is your life.
            Scarcely anybody alive today has known anything else.

          <h5><em>Engines of Devastation</em></h5>
          <p>
            Does Postmodernism still seem cool to anybody? — Probably not. Having
            sold whatever simulacrum of a soul it might have had to the fickle
            gods of fashion, it has learnt more about the reign of Chronos than it
            might have expected to – the kids get devoured, and it’s on to
            something new. What was accepted for no good reason gets discarded for
            no good reason. In political science it’s called democracy (but that’s
            another discussion).
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, there’s something profoundly just about the disappearance of
            postmodernism into the trashcan of random difference (what’s ‘in’ has
            to be new, preferably meaninglessly so). It’s even ‘poetically just’,
            whatever that means. But it also destroys information. Although
            Postmodernism was certainly a fad, it was also a <em>zeitgeist</em>,
            or spirit of the times. It meant something, despite its own best
            efforts, at least as a symptom. The disappearance of reality that it
            announced was itself real, as was the realm of simulation that
            replaced it. At least in its death, it might have amounted to
            something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider its greatest mystagogue, Jacques Derrida, and his once widely
            celebrated ‘concept’ of differance (yes, with an ‘a’), a term within a
            series of magical words that mark the undecidable, ungraspable,
            unpresentable, and ultimately inconceivable ontological non-stuff that
            supplants real events, through an endless succession of
            <em>displacements and postponements</em>. We can’t really say anything
            about it, so we have to talk about it endlessly, and entire university
            departments are required to do so. It’s ridiculous (and so it’s over).
            But it’s also, quite exactly, the globally hegemonic culture of
            Keynesianized, macroeconomic, programmatic stagnationism, and that
            isn’t over yet, although its morbidity is already highly conspicuous.
            Unlike faddish academic Postmodernism, its death is going to be really
            interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Long before the Derridoids got started, Keynes had taught governments
            that differance was something they could do. Procrastination – the
            strategic suspension of economic reality through a popularly
            ungraspable series of <em>displacements and postponements</em> –
            quickly came to define the art of politics. Why suffer today what can
            be put off until tomorrow, or suffer yourself something that could be
            somebody else’s problem? Postpone! Displace!
            <em>In the long run we are all dead</em>. Reality is for losers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Differance as it really works is a lot cruder than its reflection in
            Postmodern philosophy (and what could be philosophically cruder than
            an appeal to the notion of ‘reflection’?). For instance, it is fished
            out of the ontological <em>abgrund</em> and processed by specific
            public policy mechanisms, sustained by concrete institutions in ways
            that are to a considerable extent economically measurable, within
            elastic but most certainly finite geographical and historical limits.
            Crudest of all, and ultimately decisive, is the circumscription of
            derealization, by the real, and the return of the apocalyptic, no
            longer as a phantasmatic avatar of the ‘metaphysics of presence’ (or
            false promise of a real event), but as an impending real event, and
            one whose process of historical construction is in large measure
            intelligible. Real differance didn’t ‘deconstruct’ the apocalypse,
            <em>it built it</em>. It’s not even that difficult to see how.

            At EconLog, David Henderson has
            <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/" target="_blank">posted</a> his
            notes from John H. Cochrane’s December 3 talk at Stanford University’s
            Hoover Institution conference on ‘Restoring Robust Economic Growth in
            America’. There’s no mention of differance, but there doesn’t need to
            be.

              <em>For nearly 100 years we have tried to stop runs with government
                guarantees — deposit insurance, generous lender of last resort,
                and bailouts. That patch leads to huge moral hazard. Giving a
                banker a bailout guarantee is like giving a teenager keys to the
                car and a case of whisky. So, we appoint regulators who are
                supposed to stop the banks from taking risks, in a hopeless arms
                race against smart MBAs, lawyers and lobbyists who try to get
                around the regulation, and though we allow — nay, we encourage and
                subsidize — expansion of run-prone assets.</em>

            <p>
              <em>In Dodd-Frank, the US simply doubled down our bets on this
                regime. …

          <p>
            Bailouts delay a painful economic event (postponement) whilst
            transferring financial liability (displacement). Risk is restored to
            virtuality, as disaster is turned back into a threat, but it isn’t the
            same threat. By any remotely sane method of accountancy, it’s now
            worse. Significant virtual deterioration is substituted for actual
            discomfort. That’s the cost of derealization.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do things get worse, exactly? — In plenty of ways. Start with
            ‘moral hazard’, which is a polite way of saying ‘insanity’. Actions
            are decoupled from their consequences, removing the disincentive for
            craziness. The result, utterly predictably, is more craziness. In
            fact, anything that systematically enhances moral hazard is simply
            manufacturing craziness. It’s dumping LSD in the water supply,
            although actually probably worse. So bailouts drive us insane and
            destroy civilization (no one really disputes that, although they may
            try to avoid the topic).
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, but there’s more! — Much more, because all these displacements
            don’t just move things around, they move them <em>up</em>. Risk is
            centralized, concentrated, systematized, politicized – and that’s in
            the (entirely unrealistic) best case, when it isn’t also expanded and
            degraded by the corruption and inefficiency of weakly- or
            cynically-incentivized public institutions. This is trickle up –
            really <em>flood</em> up – economics, in which everything bad that
            ever happens to anybody gets stripped of any residual sanity (or
            realistic estimation of consequences), pooled, re-coded, complicated
            by compensatory regulation, and shifted to ever more ethereal heights
            of populist democratic irresponsibility, where the only thing that
            matters is what people want to hear, and that really isn’t ever going
            to be the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mess up enough, and you probably suffer or die” – that’s the truth.
            It’s a message that doesn’t translate into the language of Keynesian
            kick-the-can politics, which is folk Postmodernism. The nearest we
            get, as the jaws begin to close on the bail-out bucket chain, is
            “We’re going to need a bigger boat.” After innumerable episodes of
            that, we’re all huddled together on the Titanic, and things are kinda,
            sorta, looking OK. At least the band’s still playing …
          </p>
          <p>
            When abstracted from its squalid psychosis, the pattern is
            mathematically quite neat. It’s called the Martingale system, better
            known to Americans as ‘double or nothing’ (and to Brits as ‘double or
            quits’). Cochrane already touched upon it (“the US simply doubled down
            our bets”). Wager on red, and it comes up black. No problem, just
            double the bet and repeat. You can’t lose. (If you like this logic,
            Paul Krugman has an economic recovery to sell you.)
          </p>
          <p>
            What appears as disaster postponed is, in virtual reality, disaster
            expanded. The Wikipedia entry on the Martingale system helpfully
            connects it to the Taleb Distribution, otherwise known as scrounging
            pennies in front of a steam roller. The persistence of small gains
            makes this business model seem like a sure thing — until it doesn’t.

            (or impending) crisis. Asking why “surprise [is] the permanent
            condition of the U.S. political and economic elite” they trace the
            problem to “the artificial suppression of volatility — the ups and
            downs of life — in the name of stability.”

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility tend
                to become extremely fragile, while at the same time exhibiting no
                visible risks. In fact, they tend to be too calm and exhibit
                minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the
                surface. Although the stated intention of political leaders and
                economic policymakers is to stabilize the system by inhibiting
                fluctuations, the result tends to be the opposite. These
                artificially constrained systems become prone to “Black Swans” —
                that is, they become extremely vulnerable to large-scale events
                that lie far from the statistical norm and were largely
                unpredictable to a given set of observers.</em>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Part of the problem is the consequence of [the elites’] own
                damping. By attempting to centrally manage systems according to
                some predetermined scheme they actually store up volatility rather
                than dispersing it. By kicking the can down the road they
                eventually condemn themselves to bumping into a giant pile of cans
                when they run out of road. … But the elites cannot admit to
                surprise; nor can they admit to bad things starting on their
                watch. Therefore they keep sweeping things under the carpet until,
                as in some horror movie, it spawns a zombie. To make systems
                robust, says Taleb, you’ve got to admit that you can make mistakes
                and pay the price. You will have to in the end anyway.</em>

                collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The
                alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the

                it works, unweariedly mining. No Falsehood, did it rise heaven-
                high and cover the world, but Bankruptcy, one day, will sweep it
                down, and make us free of it.</em>

          <h5>
            <em>Weather forecasts for winter 2012 are getting wilder all the
              time</em>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Even before receiving the
            <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/2012/" target="_blank">Hollywood treatment</a>, the year 2012
            was
            shaping up to be a uniquely potent ‘<a href="http://2012earth.net/harmonic_convergence_and_2012.html"
              target="_blank">harmonic convergence</a>’ of end times enthusiasm. Initially condensed out of the Mayan
            calendar, the 2012 countdown was soon fizzed into a heady cocktail by
            speculative interpretations of the Yijing, Aquarian ‘New Age’
            paganism, Ufology, and mushroom mysticism. Once critical mass was
            achieved, the 2012 became a gathering point for free-floating Jewish,
            Christian, and Islamic eschatological expectations (coming or return
            of the Messiah, advent of the Antichrist, Armageddon, Rapture,
            emergence of the Twelfth Imam from occultation, and others). Just
            about anything cosmically imaginable is now firmly expected – by
            somebody – to arrive in late December, 2012.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secular eschatology also has its dogs in the fight. From reciprocally
            insulated enclaves of the Internet, apocalyptic strains of
            <a href="http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/" target="_blank">Marxism</a>
            (and
            <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/" target="_blank">libertarianism</a>) joyfully anticipated the imminent
            collapse of the global economy,
            fully confident that its downfall would usher in a post-capitalist
            social order (or untrammeled free-market societies). The boldest
            proponents of impending Technological Singularity prepared to
            <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com/singtimingpredictions.html" target="_blank">welcome</a>
            superhuman artificial intelligence (when Skynet would already be five
            years overdue). Radical environmentalists, neo-Malthusians, ‘<a
              href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2011/03/peak-oil-energy-future-gas/" target="_blank">Peak Oil</a>’
            resource-crunchers, and Clash of Civilizations theorists also
            contributed substantially to the atmosphere of impending crisis.
            Irrespective of Anthropogenic Global Warming, everything was heating
            up fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            This climate proved highly receptive to the prophetic ideas of William
            Strauss and Neil Howe, where it found a fresh and evocative
            self-description. Beginning with their book
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generations-History-Americas-Future-1584/dp/0688119123"
              target="_blank">Generations</a>
            (1992), Strauss &amp; Howe sought to explain the rhythm of history
            through the pattern of generations, as they succeeded each other in
            four-phase cycles. Their cyclic unit or ‘saeculum’ lasts 80-100 years
            and consists of generational ‘seasons’ or ‘turnings’, each
            characterized by a distinctive archetype. The
            <a href="http://www.fourthturning.com/html/turnings_3.html" target="_blank">Fourth Turning</a>, starting
            early
            in the new millennium, is ‘winter’ and ‘crisis’.
            They remark: “Today’s older Americans recognize this as the mood of
            the Great Depression and World War II, but a similar mood has been
            present in all the other great gates of our history, from the Civil
            War and Revolution back into colonial and English history.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jim Quinn’s
            <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-years-modern" target="_blank">discussion</a>
            of the Fourth Turning at
            <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/" target="_blank">Zero Hedge</a>
            anticipates the winter storms: “Based upon a review of the foreseeable
            issues confronting our society it is clear to me that a worse
            financial implosion will strike before the 2012 presidential election.
            It may be triggered by a debt ceiling confrontation, the ending of
            QE2, a panic out of the USD, hyperinflation, a surge in oil prices, or
            some combination of these possibilities. The ensuing collapse of the
            stock and bond markets will remove the last vestiges of trust in the
            existing financial system and the government bureaucrats who have
            taken taxpayer dollars and funneled them to these Wall Street
            oligarchs.”
          </p>
          <p>
            More ominously still, Quinn concludes: “History has taught us that
            Fourth Turnings end in all out war. The outcome of wars is always in
            doubt. …It may be 150 years since Walt Whitman foresaw the imminent
            march of armies, visions of unborn deeds, and a sweeping away of the
            old order, but history has brought us right back to where we started.
            Immense challenges and threats await our nation. Will we face them
            with the courage and fortitude of our forefathers? Or will we shrink
            from our responsibility to future unborn generations? The drumbeat of
            history grows louder. Our rendezvous with destiny beckons.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stormy enough yet? If not, there’s the harsh weather of Kondratiev
            winter rolling in too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nikolai Kondratiev’s ‘long waves’ fluctuate at roughly twice the
            frequency of Strauss &amp; Howe saecula (lasting roughly 40-60 years
            from ‘spring’ to ‘winter’). Originally discovered through empirical
            investigation of price movements, Kondratiev waves have stimulated a
            remarkable range of economic-historical theories. Joseph Schumpeter
            interpreted the cycle as a process of techno-economic innovation, in
            which capital was creatively revolutionized and destroyed through
            depreciation, whilst Hyman Minsky attributed it to a rhythm of
            financial speculation (in which stability fostered over-confidence,
            excess, and crisis with cyclic regularity).
          </p>
          <p>
            The discovery of the ‘long wave’ seemed to coincide with its
            disappearance – at the hands of macroeconomic management (Keynesian
            counter-cyclical policy). Unsurprisingly, the crisis of Keynesianism
            under present conditions of ‘<a

              saturation</a>’ has re-animated long wave discussion. At his Kondratiev-inspired

            a savage winter, marked by rapid progression from financial through
            economic to political crisis, culminating in a (US dollar) ‘currency
            collapse’ in 2012.

          <h5><em>There’s a lot of ruin in a global madhouse</em></h5>
          <p>
            2012 is a year that arrives pre-branded. It’s the last opportunity to
            end the world on schedule. By the end of December the window for
            apocalyptic profundity will have closed, and it’s back to the hazards
            of random, meaningless catastrophe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps a prophetic consensus will have emerged by the fall, but right
            now the outlook is foggy at best. Trawling through the Web’s most
            excitable 2012 sites doesn’t bring anything very definite into focus.
            Once discussion advances beyond the fairly solid foundation of the
            Mayan long count, and the Fourth Age of Creation (lasting from August
            11, 3114 BC, to December 21, AD 2012), things spin off into chaos with
            disconcerting rapidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether the earth is destined to plunge into a black hole is a matter
            of (at least limited) controversy, but the fact that just about every
            imaginable species of prospective calamity or transformation is being
            sucked into the 2012 prophetic vortex is easily confirmed by anybody
            with a web browser. Even the basic genre remains unsettled, with
            expectations veering wildly from celestial collisions, solar flares,
            and super-volcanoes, to spiritual awakenings, cosmic harmonizations,
            and countless varieties of Messianic fulfillment. According to the
            sober forecasters at
            <a href="http://2012apocalypse.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2012apocalypse.net</a>: “The Mayans,
            Hopis,
            Egyptians, Kabbalists, Essenes, Qero elders of
            Peru, Navajo, Cherokee, Apache, Iroquois confederacy, Dogon Tribe, and
            Aborigines all believe in an ending to this Great 2012 Apocalyptic
            Cycle.” They missed out Mother Shipton, Nostradamus, Terence McKenna,
            Kalki Bagavan, and Web Bot, yet somehow the <em>Cracked</em>
            <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17445_the-6-best-2012-apocalypse-theories-are-all-bullshit.html"

            remain unconvinced.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an aside, the best line UF has yet seen among the
            <em>deniers</em> (sorry, couldn’t resist that), is
            <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/dear-doomsayers-we-will-be-watching-you.html" rel="noopener"

            deliciously self-undermining specimen from Ian O’Neill: “No one has
            ever predicted the future, and that isn’t about to change.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In an increasingly desegregated cultural landscape, it’s not easy to
            separate out secular history and sensible opinion from the
            orgiastically gathering End Times festival, and – strangely enough –
            the world process isn’t doing much to oblige. Ritualistic
            predictions-for-the-year-ahead posts on politics and economics sites
            are practically indistinguishable from the 2012 Armageddon-is-here
            prophecies, although the sane side of prognostication is characterized
            by a greater uniformity of unrelenting bleakness: Comprehensive
            economic collapse, aggravated by administrative sclerosis, and
            accompanied by escalating international conflict / social
            disintegration, amidst the enraged screams of splintering
            civilizations (and a ‘Happy New Year’ to you, too.)

            some professional hedging, but he doesn’t even try to keep impending
            financial crisis from spilling out into cosmic immensities:

          <blockquote>

              <em>The ending of the Mayan calendar in 2012 is as misunderstood as
                the interplay between credit and debt and supply and demand; but
                the coincident collapse of the current economic paradigm and an
                arcane indicator of change should not be dismissed. … The current
                great wave [of rising prices] began in 1896. That it could crest
                and break in 2012 could be a coincidence. Or, it may not.</em>

          <p>
            Science, technology, creative culture, and enterprise are likely to
            spring some upside surprises, but the degenerative horror of the
            world’s hegemonic Keynesian political economy – combined with
            increasingly irresponsible neoconservative democracy-mongering — has
            ominously synchronized itself with the darkest visions of the 2012
            cults. A patently dysfunctional mode of socio-economic organization,
            based upon fake money, belligerent idiocracy, and electorally-enabled
            looting scams, is aggressively imposing itself – with an almost
            incomprehensible absence of self-reflection — upon a world that
            already has plenty of indigenous pathologies to contend with. The
            resulting New World Order, entirely predictably, is a lunatic asylum,
            and even its most functional components (such as Singapore and the
            Chinese SARs of Hong Kong and Macao) are networked into the collective
            delirium. When the Euro, Japanese Yen, and US Dollar collapse
            (probably in that order) the financial and geopolitical tsunami will
            wash over everybody. If that doesn’t happen in 2012, history has no
            sense of narrative climax at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the ‘bright’ side – for all the can-kickers out there – the words
            of Adam Smith that have defined 2011 continue to resonate. “Young man,
            there’s a lot of ruin in a nation,” and even more in a global system.
            Perhaps the slow-motion disintegration of hegemonic
            <del>neo-fascism</del> Keynesian social democracy will spin itself out
            beyond the horizon of the Mayan calendar, which would really give us
            something to look forward to …

          </a>
          <p>
            Some time late on the 21st of December last year [2012], Terrestrial
            Omega Event 2012 streaked past relatively quietly, on a trajectory
            from the dread realm of ominous premonitions into the cobwebbed vault
            of defunct absurdities. (The fact that its glancing blow reduced
            <em>Urban Future</em> to a tangled wreck of smoking weakly radioactive
            debris need be of no concern to anybody except our five regular
            readers.) Another non-event was thus added to the long chain of
            ontological omissions that compose the Apocalyptic Tradition. Things
            continue, on their existing tracks, as common sense had confidently
            predicted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a world saturated in modernist irony, where even the most
            passionate beliefs are modulated by forms of mass-media entertainment,
            no ‘Great Disappointment’ is any longer possible, such as that
            afflicting the
            <a href="http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/christn/chmillhp.html" target="_blank">Millerites</a>
            of the mid-1840s. A 2012 Reuters/Ipsos
            <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/05/01/ten-percent-of-world-population-fears-2012-apocalypse-belief-strongest-in-china/"
              target="_blank">survey</a>
            found that 10% of the world population (and no less than 20% of
            Chinese) had ‘sincerely’ expected the End to arrive on December 21st.
            When it didn’t, so what? There’s always something else on — or rather,
            the same thing, in different flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Channel hopping is especially easy because it isn’t even necessary to
            switch genre. The collapse of the Occidental World Order is like Henry
            Ford’s Model T: “You can have it in any color you like, as long as
            it’s black.” What you can’t do is get it over with. It’s too big to
            fail, even after it has manifestly failed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The December non-event was not the End, or even the end of the End,
            but rather the end of the end of the End. Dated Doomsday has been
            de-activated, leaving an indefinitely dilated Ending without
            conclusion. Now that the prospect of a finish has finished, finishing
            becomes interminable. Dates march onwards, without destination, into
            ever extended horizons of collapse. Apocalypse, stripped of
            Armageddon, is normalized. It can now demand undistracted recognition
            as ‘the system’, the way of the world, feeding upon the spectacle of
            permanent crisis through the Media-Apocalypse Complex. As
            (Fukuyama-final) Liberal Democratic politics adjusts to a chronic
            state of emergency, it is finally possible to ‘<a

              done</a>’, in a time when nothing can be done. Disinhibited insanity delights
            in its ultimate mania.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because it’s insanity, it can’t <em>really</em> last, but Apocalypse
            has outlasted Doomsday, and reality has lost its last signs. For
            purposes of polite conversation, therefore, it is best to grant the
            Keynesians / Postmodernists absolute triumph, and to concur that the
            consequences of irrealism can be indefinitely postponed. When in
            Bedlam, do as the bedlamites do. Anything else would be pointless
            irascibility, out of keeping with the spirit of the age. After all
            (except itself) Apocalypse Forever is the final Western religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Progressive Apocalypse, Apocalypse Forever, assumes the death of
            Doomsday, which provides the occasion for an obituary. For
            reactionaries of the ‘Throne and Altar’ variety, mourning will incline
            towards eschatology, as the moment of definitive judgment is interred.
            Here in the eschaton-blitzed wreckage of <em>Urban Future</em>,
            however, our remembrance is more concisely arithmetical. We recall
            dates gone forever, and with them the time inversions that are
            expressed through countdowns, intensive escalations, and compressions.
            When the end had a date, time could zero upon it, rather than
            dissipating into endlessly-extended fogbanks of blighted futurity.
          </p>
          <p>
            December 21st, 2012, was the last Doomsday date, and thus the day
            Doomsday died. It might even have been the most popular, but it was
            very far from the greatest. Extracted predominantly from the
            <a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-mayan.html" target="_blank">calendar of the
              Mayans</a>,
            it neatly concluded the 13th Baktun, but in doing so broke quite
            arbitrarily from the (already awkward and compromised) numerical
            organization of the dating system, with its preference for modulus-20
            unit hierarchies. Whatever the attractions of exoticism, turning to
            pop Mayanology for a planetary Apocalypse schedule was also radically
            arbitrary, given the Abrahamic Hegemony that had structured the world
            order over the previous half millennium. Still, the Maya had conducted
            their own preliminary experiment in collapse, enabling Mel Gibson to
            excavate a striking movie from the ruins, introduced by a quote from
            Will Durant: “A great civilization is not conquered from without until
            it has destroyed itself from within.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When estimated in terms of numerical elegance and metaphysical
            profundity, the truly great Doomsday was Y2K, the most beautiful
            weapon in history (despite its failure to detonate). Y2K was automatic
            and techno-compatible (actually, techno-dependent), chronometrically
            precise, perfectly counter-Abrahamic, and calendrically creative
            (re-setting AD 1900 to Year 00). It was staged from the absence of an
            integrated, malevolent subject, out of simple arithmetic, targeting an
            exactly scheduled, consummate fulfillment of millennial expectation
            through sheer coincidence. The world order was to have been softly
            terminated, by ‘chance’. Nothing that has ever actually happened in
            history made as much sense as this (which didn’t). The more closely it
            is examined, the more exquisite it appears. Among other missed
            Doomsdays, none comes close. But as Y2K said, insidiously: Never Mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the shoddiest of the Old Doomsdays satisfied intellectual
            appetites that will now hunger forever. First of all, and most
            basically, they catered to the transcendental impulse, understood as a
            search for ultimate or enveloping structures and principles of
            organization. As a metaphysical event, conclusive Apocalypse promises
            an escape from distracting detail and
            <em>an apprehension of the frame</em>. Biblical bases for such
            apprehension are found in Isaiah 34:4 — “All the stars of the heavens
            will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll.” This image is
            repeated in Revelation 6:14 — “And the heaven departed as a scroll
            when it is rolled together.” Apocalyptic time does not add a new
            sentence, or even a new chapter, to the chronicle of events. It
            uncovers the limit of the scroll, by exceeding it. For that, however,
            it has to complete itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, a punctual Apocalypse fulfills a semiotic (and in particular
            numerical) realism, as expressed — most lucidly — in occultism and
            schizophrenia. The apocalyptic exposes a primal encryption of culture,
            coding the operations of super-human intelligence (God or gods,
            transcended masters, aliens, time-travelers, spontaneous social order,
            or bacteria … any will do). A true calendar is revealed, in which
            semiotic exhaustion, or roll-over, precisely coincides with the end of
            a real epoch. Hyper-traditionalism thus exoticizes itself in the
            formulation:
            <em>travel inwards far enough and you arrive at the outside</em>. It
            thus provides the most radical challenge to the fundamental mantra of
            the contemporary human sciences – the (<a
              href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/saussure.htm"
              target="_blank">Saussurean</a>) arbitrary nature of the sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional and essentially modern contribution to the apocalyptic
            is made by the arithmetic of the intrinsically unsustainable, as
            defined by Thomas Malthus (1768-1834) in his
            <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. The empirical
            foundations for an inevitable crisis are found in trends to
            exponential growth and their projected collision with a limit.
            Variants of such apocalyptic projection are found in Marxism,
            environmentalism, and Technological Singularity (<a
              href="http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~syrbe/mst/Crisisbook.doc" target="_blank">Karl Marx</a>,
            <a href="http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/" target="_blank">M. King Hubbert</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/" target="_blank">Ray Kurzweil</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even from this brief survey, it becomes possible to outline certain
            core features of <em>a model apocalypse</em>: comprehensive, punctual,
            and climactic. In other words, a transition that cannot be contained
            by the pre-existing nature of time, occurring at an exact, cryptically
            anticipated moment, bringing the central historical process to its
            culmination. All of that is gathered together in Doomsday, and
            Doomsday is dead.<br />

          <h5><em>Could we be facing the ultimate resource crunch?</em></h5>
          <p>
            Over at Zero Hedge, Sean Corrigan
            <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-long-way-reaching-our-peak"
              target="_blank">unleashes</a>
            a fizzing polemic against the (M. King Hubbert) ‘Peak Oil’ school of
            resource doomsters (enjoy the article if you’re
            <em>laissez-faire</em> inclined, or the comments if you’re not).
          </p>
          <p>
            Of particular relevance to density advocates is Corrigan’s “exercise
            in contextualization” (a kind of de-stressed
            <em>Stand on Zanzibar</em>) designed to provide an image of the
            planet’s ‘demographic burden’:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>For example, just as an exercise in contextualisation, consider
                the following:-</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The population of Hong Kong: 7 million. Its surface area: 1,100
                km2</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The population of the World: nigh on 7 billion, i.e., HK x
                1000</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>1000 x area of HK = 110,000 km2 = the area of Cuba or Iceland</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Approximate area of the Earth’s landmass = 150 million km2</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>Approximate total surface area = 520 million km2</em></p>
            <p>
              <em>So, were we to build one, vast city of the same population
                density as Hong Kong to cover the entirety of [Cuba], this would
                accommodate all of humanity, and take up just 0.07% of the
                planet’s land area and 0.02% of the Earth’s surface.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Anybody eagerly anticipating hypercities,
            <a href="http://www.arcology.com/" target="_blank">arcologies</a>, and
            other prospective experiments in large-scale social packing is likely
            to find this calculation rather disconcerting, if only because – taken
            as a whole — Hong Kong actually isn’t that dense. For sure, the
            downtown ‘synapse’ connecting the HK Island with Kowloon is
            impressively intense, but most of the Hong Kong SAR (Special
            Administrative Region) is green, rugged, and basically deserted. It’s
            (mean) average density of 6,364 / km2 doesn’t get anywhere close to
            that of the top 100 cities (Manila’s 43,000 / km2 is almost seven
            times greater). Corrigan isn’t envisaging a megalopolis, but a
            Cuba-scale suburb.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether densitarians are more or less likely than average to worry
            about Peak Oil or related issues might be an interesting question (the
            New Urbanists tend to be quite greenish). If they really want to see
            cities scale the heights of social possibility, however, they need to
            start worrying about population shortage. With the human population
            projected to level-off at around 10 billion, there might never be
            enough people to make cities into the ultra-dense monsters that
            futuristic imagination has long hungered for.

            <h4 class="post-title">Hard Futurism</h4>
          </a>
          <h5><em>Are you ready for the next big (nasty) thing?</em></h5>
          <p>
            For anyone with interests both in extreme practical futurism and the
            renaissance of the Sinosphere,
            <a href="http://machineslikeus.com/interview-hugo-de-garis.html" target="_blank">Hugo de Garis</a>
            is an irresistible reference point. A former teacher of Topological
            Quantum Computing (don’t ask) at the International Software School of
            Wuhan University, and later Director of the Artificial Brain Lab at
            Xiamen University, de Garis’ career symbolizes the emergence of a
            cosmopolitan Chinese technoscientific frontier, where the outer-edge
            of futuristic possibility condenses into precisely-engineered reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            De Garis’ work is ‘hard’ not only because it involves fields such as
            Topological Quantum Computing, or because – more accessibly — he’s
            devoted his research energies to the building of brains rather than
            minds, or even because it has generated questions faster than
            solutions. In his ‘semi-retirement’ (since 2010),
            hard-as-in-difficult, and hard-as-in-hardware, have been supplanted by
            hard-as-in-mind-numbingly-and-incomprehensibly-brutal – or, in his own
            words, an increasing obsession with the impending ‘Gigadeath’ or ‘<a
              href="http://www.amazon.com/Artilect-War-Controversy-%20%20Concerning-Intelligent/dp/0882801546/ref=sr_1_1?%20%20s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1307933575&amp;amp;sr=1-1"
              target="_blank">Artilect War</a>‘.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to de Garis, the approach to Singularity will revolutionize
            and polarize international politics, creating new constituencies,
            ideologies, and conflicts. The basic dichotomy to which everything
            must eventually succumb divides those who embrace the emergence of
            transhuman intelligence, and those who resist it. The former he calls
            ‘<a href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/extras/deGaris/cosmism.html" target="_blank">cosmists</a>‘, the latter
            ‘terrans’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since massively-augmented and robotically-reinforced ‘cosmists’
            threaten to become invincible, the ‘terrans’ have no option but
            pre-emption. To preserve human existence in a recognizable state, it
            is necessary to violently suppress the cosmist project in advance of
            its accomplishment. The mere prospect of Singularity is therefore
            sufficient to provoke a political — and ultimately military —
            convulsion of unprecedented scale. A Terran triumph (which might
            require much more than just a military victory) would mark an
            inflection point in deep history, as the super-exponential trend of
            terrestrial intelligence production – lasting over a billion years —
            was capped, or reversed. A Cosmist win spells the termination of human
            species dominion, and a new epoch in the geological, biological, and
            cultural process on earth, as the torch of material progress is passed
            to the emerging <em>techo sapiens</em>. With the stakes set so high,
            the melodramatic grandeur of the de Garis narrative risks
            understatement no less than hyperbole.
          </p>
          <p>
            The giga-magnitude body-count that de Garis postulates for his
            Artilect (artificial intellect) War is the dark side expression of
            Moore’s Law or Kurzweilean increasing returns – an extrapolation from
            exponentiating historical trends, in this case, casualty figures from
            major human conflicts over time. It reflects the accumulating trend to
            global wars motivated by trans-national ideologies with
            ever-increasing stakes. One king is (perhaps) much like another, but a
            totalitarian social direction is very different from a liberal one
            (even if such paths are ultimately revisable). Between a Terran world
            order and a Cosmist trajectory into Singularity, the distinction
            approaches the absolute. The fate of the planet is decided, with costs
            to match.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the de Garis Gigadeath War scenario is pre-emptive in relation to
            prospective Singularity, his own intervention is meta-pre-emptive –
            since he insists that world politics must be anticipatively re-forged
            in order to forestall the looming disaster. The Singularity prediction
            ripples backwards through waves of pre-adaptation, responding at each
            stage to eventualities that are yet to unfold. Change unspools from
            out of the future, complicating the arrow of time. It is perhaps no
            coincidence that among de Garis’ major research interests is
            reversible computing, where temporal directionality is unsettled at
            the level of precise engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does ethnicity and cultural tradition merely dissolve before the
            tide-front of this imminent Armageddon? The question is not entirely
            straightforward. Referring to his informal polling of opinion on the
            coming great divide, de Garis recalls his experience teaching in
            China,
            <a href="http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/05/19/merge-or-purge/" target="_blank">remarking</a>:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>I know from the lectures I’ve given over the past two decades on
                species dominance that when I invite my audiences to vote on
                whether they are more Terran than Cosmist, the result is usually
                50-50. … At first, I thought this was a consequence of the fact
                that the species dominance issue is too new, causing people who
                don’t really understand it to vote almost randomly – hence the
                50:50 result. But gradually, it dawned on me that many people felt
                as ambivalently about the issue as I do. Typically, the
                Terran/Cosmist split would run from 40:60 to 60:40 (although I do
                notice that with my very young Chinese audiences in computer
                science, the Cosmists are at about 80%).</em>

            Like ‘fascism’ – with which it is closely connected in the popular

            charge that it tends to blow the fuses of any attempt at dispassionate
            analysis. We can thank the political black magic of Adolf Hitler and

            Witnesses …) international law restricted its attention to the actions
            and grievances of states and individuals, with the latter subdivided
            into combatants and noncombatants. The National Socialist trauma
            changed that fundamentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            On December 9, 1948, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the
            Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (as Resolution
            260), defining a new category of internationally recognized crimes as
            “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a
            national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1948, defending genocide has been the surest way to ruin a
            dinner party. That doesn’t mean, however, that the topic deserves to
            be immunized from controversy. There is one question in particular
            that merits intense and prolonged scrutiny: Is genocide really worse
            than killing a lot of people?
          </p>
          <p>
            Posed slightly more technically: Is there a crime of genocide that
            stands above and beyond mass murder (of equivalent scale)? Or (a rough
            equivalent): Can groups be the specific victims of crime? This is to
            ask whether groups exist – and have value — as anything more than a
            nominal or strictly formal set, whose reality is exhausted by its
            constituent individual members. The existence of genocide as a legal
            category presumes a (positive) answer to this question, and in doing
            so it closes down a problem of great and very general importance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The classical liberal presumption is quite different, as summarized (a
            little bluntly) by the provocative remark made by British Prime
            Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1987 “… there is no such thing as
            society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.”
            Harshly extrapolating from this position, a certain irony might be
            found in the fact that a horrified response to National Socialist
            crimes has taken the form of a legal codification of racial
            collectivism. At the very least, it is puzzling that suspicions
            directed at legal references to ‘group rights’ and ‘hate crimes’ among
            those of a libertarian bent has not been extended to the category of
            genocide.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the opposite camp, the most fully articulated defense of
            collectives as real entities is found, as might be expected, in the
            foundation of sociology as an academic discipline, and more
            particularly in Émile Durkheim’s argument for ‘social facts’.

            looks back further, to Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan, or social being, in
            which human individuals are absorbed as organic parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the distinction of ‘society’ and ‘individual’ has colloquial
            (and political) meaning, those inclined to the analysis of complex
            systems are more likely to ask which groups or societies are
            <em>real individuals</em>, exhibiting functional or behavioral
            integrity, as self-reproducing wholes. In pursuing this line of
            investigation, it is far more relevant to discriminate between types
            of groups than between groups and individuals, or even wholes and
            parts. It is especially helpful to distinguish
            <em>feature groups</em> from <em>unit groups</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A feature group is determined by logical classification. This might be
            expressed as a self-identification or sense of ‘belonging’, an
            external political or academic categorization, or some combination of
            these, but the essentials remain the same in each case. Certain
            features of the individual are isolated and emphasized (such as
            genitalia, sexual orientation, skin-color, income, or religious
            belief), and then employed as the leading clue in a process of formal
            grouping, which conforms theoretically to the mathematics of sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            A unit group, in contrast, is defined as an assemblage, or functional
            whole. Its members belong to the group insofar as they work together,
            even if they are entirely devoid of common identity features.
            Membership is decided by role, rather than traits, since one becomes
            part of such a group through functional involvement, rather than
            classification of characteristics. Social instances of such groups
            include primitive tribes (determined by functional unities rather than
            the categories of modern ‘identity politics’), cities, states, and
            companies. The most obvious instance in socialist theory is the
            ‘soviet’ or ‘danwei’ work unit (whilst social classes are feature
            groups).
          </p>
          <p>
            To take a non-anthropomorphic example, consider a skin cell. Its
            <em>feature group</em> is that of skin cells in general, as
            distinguished from nerve cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or others.
            Any two skin cells share the same feature group, even if they belong
            to different organisms, or even species, exist on different
            continents, and never functionally interact. The natural
            <em>unit group</em> of the same skin cell, in contrast, would be the
            organism it belongs to. It shares this unit group with all the other
            cells involved in the reproduction of that organism through time,
            including those (such as intestinal bacteria) of quite separate
            genetic lineages. Considered as a unit group member, a skin cell has
            greater integral connection with the non-biological tools and other
            ‘environmental’ elements involved in the life of the organism than it
            does with other skin cells – even perfect clones – with which it is
            not functionally entangled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, both feature groups and unit groups are ‘fuzzy sets’, and the
            distinction itself – whilst theoretically precise – is empirically
            hazy. An urban American street gang, for instance, will in most cases
            be vague in its features and unity, perhaps ‘ethnic’ to some degree of
            definition, with a determinable age-range, and with ambiguous
            functional connections to groupings on a larger scale, or to
            peripheral members whose status of ‘belonging’ is not strictly
            decidable. Tattoos and other membership markings are likely to involve
            both identity and integrity aspects – traits and roles. Rituals of
            belonging (ordeals, oaths, rites of passage) are designed to
            disambiguate membership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite such haziness, the distinction between these two types of
            groups strikes directly at the core problematic of genocide (as a
            legal category). When a <em>unit group</em> is destroyed, a real
            individual is ‘killed’ above and beyond whatever human losses are
            incurred. The destruction of a <em>feature group</em>, in contrast,
            whatever the cultural loss, is not any kind of <em>killing</em> beyond
            the mass murder of human individuals. If this is worse than murder, we
            should know why.
          </p>
          <p>
            This conclusion seems relevant when weighing, for instance, the 1937
            Massacre of Nanjing on the scale of historical atrocity. It suggests,
            at least, that an act of violence directed against a city – or
            integrated population <em>unit</em> — is no less worthy of specific
            legal attention than a quantitatively equivalent offense against an
            ethnicity, or determined population <em>type</em>. It seems to be no
            more than an accident of history that, in order to appropriate the
            category of genocide, massive crimes of the former variety need to be
            recoded as if they more properly belonged to the latter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Complex systems ontology aside, these matters resolve ultimately into
            obscure social values. Orthodox conceptions of ‘genocide’ assume that
            ethnic identity simply and unquestionably means more than active
            citizenship, or participation in the life of a city. Perhaps this
            assumption is even arguable. But has it been argued?

          <p>
            “Do The Three Abrahamic Faiths Worship The Same God?” Peter Berger
            <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/berger/2011/12/14/do-the-three-abrahamic-faiths-worship-the-same-god/"
              target="_blank">asks</a>, on his blog at the American Interest. His answer, which seems to be
            programmed at least as much by the sensitivities of interfaith
            politics as by the exigencies of rigorous theology, is a politely
            nuanced “yes (but).” If anyone is unconvinced about the urgent
            pertinence of multicultural diplomacy to the question, Berger settles
            such doubts quickly by depicting the integrated conception of
            ‘Abrahamic faith’ as a response to the ‘Clash of Civilizations’
            climate that arose in the wake of 9/11, “with the altogether admirable
            intention of countering anti-Islamic hatred.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, his argument is both realistic and relatively
            uncontroversial. It is comparable to an informal set theory, or
            cladistics, briefly surveying family resemblances and dissimilarities
            between branches of the Abrahamic religious ‘tree’ and concluding,
            reasonably enough, that none of the potential groupings are absolutely
            strict (each faith, even narrowly defined, is differentiated within
            itself by sub-branches, and twigs), and that the coherence of
            ‘Judeo-Christian’ monotheism is considerably stronger than that of
            ‘Abrahamic Faith’ in general. Whatever the complexity of these
            branchings, however, they derive from a readily identifiable trunk.
            Berger cites a lecture by the Protestant theologian Miroslav Volf:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Yes, one can say that Christians and Muslims believe in the “same
                God”. There are enough common affirmations to justify this—most
                importantly, of course, the belief that there is only one God
                (what the late Richard Niebuhr, coincidentally another Yale
                Divinity professor, called “radical monotheism”)—but also the
                belief in a personal creator distinct from the creation, and the
                giver of a moral code.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            When evaluated from a wide enough angle, it is clear that the God of
            Jews, Christians, and Muslims is distinctively specified, relative to
            alternative religious traditions:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Sometimes it is a good idea to step back and look at the imputed
                collectivity from afar. It may help to look at the three
                ‘Abrahamic’ faiths from, say, Benares, one of the most holy cities
                of Hinduism and near which the Buddha preached his first sermon.
                Looked at from that far location, the family resemblance between
                the three versions suddenly appears quite clearly. Hindus and
                Buddhists sometimes speak of ‘West Asian religion’ in contrast
                with their own ‘South Asian ‘or ‘East Asian religion’. It then
                seems just about inevitable to say that Jews, Christians and
                Muslims, whatever their differences, do indeed worship the same
                God.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>To be sure, there are similarities between Benares and Jerusalem
                as well. There are Hindu versions of theism, with intense
                devotions to personal deities (</em>bhakti<em>), but there is no real analogue to the monotheism that
                originated in the deserts of the Near East. In Vedanta, arguably
                the most sophisticated form of Hinduism, the ultimate reality is
                the </em>brahman<em>, the impersonal ocean of divinity in which all individual
                identities eventually dissolve. There are theistic elements in
                Mahayana Buddhism, with devotion directed toward godlike </em>boddhisatvas<em>— individuals who have
                attained Enlightenment, but who, out of
                compassion, delay their entry into the final bliss in order to
                help others to get there. But that bliss too ends in that
                impersonal ocean of divinity that seems for many centuries to have
                dominated the religious imagination of India, from where it
                migrated eastward.
              </em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Yet, whilst the theological dimension of this question is very far
            from uninteresting, or inconsequential, it limits the question at
            least as much as it clarifies it. More than a faith, the ‘children of
            Abraham’ share a story, and – still more importantly — a sense of
            history
            <em>as a story</em>, and this is the factor that most tightly bundles
            them together, irrespective of all quibbling over narrative details.
            Abraham is the beginning of a tale, even if it can be projected back
            (at least a little way) beyond him. He defines the meaning of history,
            as an interaction with God, through which the passage of collective
            time acquires structure, direction, unity, radical finitude, moral and
            religious significance. Abrahamic history has purpose, and a
            destination. Above all it tells the story of a moral community, whose
            righteousness and unrighteousness will ultimately be judged.
            Eschatology is its real key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the Abrahamic tradition is rooted in a distinctive experience
            of history, it extends beyond theistic faith. Indeed, any
            comprehension of this tradition that excludes Marxism, fascist
            millenarianism, and ‘liberal’ secular progressivism (even that of the
            ‘New Atheists’) is woefully incomplete, to the point of diversionary
            propaganda. Uniquely, the Abrahamic faiths do not merely rise, fall,
            and persist. They are superceded by new revelations, or afflicted by
            heresy and schism. Their encounters and (inevitable) conflicts become
            internalized episodes that immediately demand doctrinal and narrative
            intelligibility. Hence the affinity between the Abrahamic faiths and
            historical (as ‘opposed’ to pedagogical, cosmic, or naturalistic)
            dialectics: the ‘other’, merely by appearing on the stage, must play
            its role in the world-historical drama of belief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strict monotheism is the personification of narrative unity, and in
            the end it is the narrative unity that matters. Whether history is
            finally to be appraised from the perspective of the people of Israel,
            the Church, the Ummah, achieved communism, an Aryan master-race, or
            secular multicultural globalism, it will have been integrated through
            the production of a moral community, and judged as a coherent whole by
            the standard of that community’s purity and righteousness. It will
            have been comprehended by a collective subject whose story — it
            insists — is the entire meaning of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the minor paganisms of antiquity, and the major paganisms of the
            east, this structure of understanding has the objective potential to
            be offensive to an almost inestimable degree, so the fact that pagans
            have rarely contested it with an animosity that even remotely
            approaches its ‘internal’ conflicts and disputations is intriguing.
            Whilst cases of anti-semitism, anti-clericalism, islamophobia,
            anti-communism, anti-fascism, and systematic political incorrectness
            have, on occasions, been plausibly derived from pagan inspirations, in
            the overwhelming majority of cases it is the various ‘fraternal’
            branches of the great Abrahamic family that have wrought devastation
            upon each other. Indeed, persecution, as a particular mode of
            ‘zealous’ or ‘enthusiastic’ violence, seems to be an Abrahamic
            specialty, one that depends upon conceptions of ‘intolerable’
            idolatry, heresy, apostasy, false-consciousness, or political
            incorrectness that are found nowhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            God told Abraham to kill his own son, and he was ready to do so (Gen
            22:1-19). That is how he earned his status as the ur-patriarch of the
            tradition, whose children are defined by the ghost of a knife at their
            throats. Demonstrated willingness to kill in the name of the Lord, or
            its abstracted equivalent (the meaning of history), is the initiatory
            ideal, and the beginning of the world story that now encompasses
            everyone. After this original ritual, Isaac’s life was no longer
            natural, but ideological. It was suspended, vulnerably, from a word
            owing nothing to the protective bond tying an animal to its progeny
            (symbolically terminated by Abraham’s surrender to divine command),
            but settled on high, in the narrative structure of the world. If God
            had willed it — or the story demanded it — he would have been slain.
            In this way an unnatural line, existing only as an expression of
            divine purpose, breaks from the archaic pagan order of ‘meaningless’
            procreation and nurture. (The place assigned to the sacrifice, Mount
            Moriah, would later be the site of Jerusalem, the city of the end of
            time, and beyond nature.) Isaac was spared, but the pagan world was
            not similarly reprieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existence of an Abrahamic tradition has an importance that far
            exceeds its internal politics and internecine rivalries, since it is
            indistinguishable from the historical unification of the world, and no
            ‘other’ is able to remain outside its narrative order. In much of the
            world, even in its Abrahamic heartlands, to refuse God is no great
            thing, and perhaps little more than a mildly comical affectation, but
            to depart from World History is quite another matter. It is then that
            the knife of Abraham glints again.

              Mexican immigration doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. None of our
              existing institutions or social structures are prepared for what’s
              coming and the century will be a rollercoaster ride on fire.</em>

            <h4 class="post-title">Gibson’s Nightmare</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            At the most superficial level, there’s probably some sleeplessness
            accompanying the anxiety that the whole of
            <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-William-Gibson/dp/0399158448">The Peripheral</a></em>
            — once people have processed it — begins to look like a piece of
            fabulously ornate, maze-patterned wrapping paper for the four pages
            that really matter. There’s the Great Pacific Garbage Patch elsewhere,
            along with ubiquitous near-future drones, and – further down the
            time-line — some exotic neo-primitivist adornments — but basically, if
            you’ve read Chapter 79, you’ve got the thing. Yes, that’s to miss out
            on some of the time-travel structure, but Gibson takes such a lazy
            approach to that (deliberately suppressing all paradox circuitry) it’s
            no great loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the positive side, those four pages are really something. Chapter
            79 is helpfully entitled <em>The Jackpot</em>, and contains what might
            well be the most profound reworking of apocalypticism of modern times.
            There are some (fairly weak) remarks
            <a href="http://www.dailygrail.com/Essays/2014/12/Mad-Max-Fury-Road-and-the-pre-Jackpot-Years">here</a>.
            Perhaps
            somebody has already contributed some better commentary,
            that I’ve missed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jackpot is a catastrophe with a fruit-machine model — all the
            reels have to click together ‘right’ for it to amount to disaster.
            It’s therefore poly-causal, cross-lashed, or “multiplex” — eluding
            narrative apprehension through multiplicity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… it was no one thing. … it was multicausal, with no particular
              beginning and no end. More a climate than an event, so not the way
              apocalypse stories liked to have a big event, after which everybody
              ran around with guns … or else were eaten alive by something caused
              by the big event. Not like that.</em>
          </p>
          <em> </em>
          <p>
            <em>It was androgenic … Not that they’d known what they were doing, had
              meant to make problems, but they’s caused it anyway. And in fact the
              climate, the weather, caused by there being too much carbon, had
              been the driver for a lot of other things.How that got worse and
              never better, and was just expected to, ongoing. Because people in
              the past, clueless as to how that worked, had fucked it all up, then
              not been able to get it together to do anything about it, even after
              they knew, and now it was too late.</em>
          </p>
          <p>It kills 80% of the world’s human population in the end.</p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1586"></span>… Except that’s not the end. The end is
            Neoreaction:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“What about China?”<br />
              … “They’d had a head start,” [Netherton] said.<br />
              “At what?”<br />
              “At how the world would work, after the jackpot. This … is still
              ostensibly a democracy. A majority of empowered survivors,
              considering the jackpot, and no doubt their own positions, wanted
              none of that. Blamed it, in fact.”<br />
              “Who runs it, then?”<br />
              “Oligarchs, corporations, neomonarchists. Hereditary monarchies
              provided conveniently familiar armatures. Essentially feudal,
              according to its critics. Such as they are.”<br />
              “The King of England?”<br />
              “The City of London,” he said. “The Guilds of the City. In alliance
              with people like Lev’s father. Enabled by people like Lowbeer.”<br />
              “The whole world’s funny?” She remembered Lowbeer saying that.<br />
              “The klept,” he said, misunderstanding her, “isn’t funny at
              all.”</em>

              right through the ruin and out the other side and find the dream we
              glimpsed as we crossed into the 21st century. […] It’s a condition

            you throw your last scraps of civilized incentive-architecture in a
            dumpster and set it on fire it looks like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Cities across the country, beginning with the District of Columbia,
              are moving to copy Richmond’s controversial approach because early
              indications show it has helped reduce homicide rates. […] But the
              program requires governments to reject some basic tenets of law
              enforcement even as it challenges notions of appropriate ways to
              spend tax dollars. […] … when the elaborate efforts at engagement
              fail, the mentors still pay those who pledge to improve, even when,
              like [violent criminal Lonnie] Holmes, they are caught with a gun,
              or worse — suspected of murder. […] … To maintain the trust of the
              young men they’re guiding, mentors do not inform police of what they
              know about crimes committed. At least twice, that may have allowed
              suspected killers in the stipend program to evade responsibility for
              homicides. […] And yet, interest in the program is surging among
              urban politicians. Officials in Miami, Toledo, Baltimore and more
              than a dozen cities in between are studying how to replicate
              Richmond’s program. […] … five years into Richmond’s
              multimillion-dollar experiment, 84 of 88 young men who have
              participated in the program remain alive, and 4 in 5 have not been
              suspected of another gun crime or suffered a bullet wound … […]
              Richmond’s decision to pay people to stay out of trouble began a
              decade ago during a period of despair. […] In 2007, Richmond’s
              homicide tally had surged to 47, making it the country’s
              sixth-deadliest city per capita. In the 20 years prior to that,
              Richmond lost 740 people to gun violence, and more than 5,000 had
              been injured by a bullet. […] Elected leaders of the heavily African
              American city of about 100,000 began treating homicides as a public
              health emergency. … [DeVone Boggan] who had lost a brother in a
              shooting in Michigan … had to raise the money because he couldn’t
              persuade officials
              <strong>to give tax dollars directly to violent firearms
                offenders</strong>. […] Boggan and his streetwise crew of ex-cons selected an initial
              group of 21 gang members and suspected criminals for the program.
              One night in 2010, he persuaded them to come to city hall, where he
              invited them to work with mentors and plan a future without guns. As
              they left, Boggan surprised each one with $1,000 — no strings
              attached. […] “This is controversial, I get it,” Boggan said. “But
              what’s really happening is that they are getting rewarded for doing
              really hard work, and it’s definite hard work when you talk about
              stopping picking up a gun to solve your problems.” […] So far, the
              attention — and money — seems to be working for Holmes. Although the
              $1,500 he has received since getting out of prison last fall has not
              led to a miraculous transformation, it enabled him to make a down
              payment on his black 2015 Nissan Versa — something meaningful for a
              young man who for many years was homeless. […] He now spends hours
              each day in the car, driving around with friends, often smoking pot
              but not “hunting” — Vaughn’s term for seeking conflict with rivals.
              […] “The money is a big part,” Holmes says. “I can’t count the
              number of times it has kept me from . . . doing what I’ve got to do.
              It stopped me from going to hit that liquor [store] or this, you
              feel me, it’s a relief to not have to go do this and endanger my
              life for a little income, you feel me?” …</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s as much as I can take. The phrase subject to XS emphasis
            describes the core principle of the scheme. Maybe it should count as a
            relief that these gangstas aren’t being directly rewarded for whacking
            shop-keepers.
          </p>

            There’s a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danegeld">term</a> for this
            kind of scheme: Dane Geld. It’s not something civilizations with a

            Assuming that the Mandate of Heaven is always the
            <em>real</em> principle of regime legitimation, this looks like an
            interesting <em>status quo</em> problem. If the present world order is
            working, it’s doing a conspicuously poor job of advertising the fact —
            especially to Western populations.

            <em>Scope is real. If you ever have to choose between voting a
              convicted serial abuser of children into the Presidential office —
              but this person otherwise seems stable and collected — versus a
              Presidential candidate who seems easy to provoke and who has ‘bad
              days’ and doesn’t listen to advisors and once said “Why do we have
              all these nukes if we can’t use them?”, it is deadly important that
              you vote for the pedophile. It isn’t physically possible to abuse
              enough children per day over 4 years to do as much damage as you can
              do with one wrong move in the National Security Decision-Making
              Game.</em>

            Martin Hutchinson

            that — even after factoring in the crushing losses of WWI — the
            ‘Downton era’ did things better:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In certain respects — behavioral and otherwise — the “Downton Abbey
              economy” of 1920 was greatly preferable to the one we are
              experiencing today. […] A move to a “Downton Abbey economy” should
              not imply a sharp increase in inequality, rather the opposite. It is
              interesting to note that almost 100 years of progressive bloat of
              the public sector in both Britain and the U.S. — supposedly
              undertaken to reduce economic inequality — have in reality tended to
              increase it. […] Public spending (including local government) was
              around 25% of GDP in Britain in 1920 and about 15% of GDP in the
              U.S., compared to 40% plus in both countries today. It must be
              questioned what benefits the public has gained, either in greater
              equality or better services, from the massive rise in public
              spending since the Downton Abbey period, which itself was inflated
              from pre-World War I days.</em>
          </p>
          <p><span id="more-2162"></span>[…]</p>
          <p>
            <em>Apart from smaller government and less inequality, the Downton
              Abbey economy had a number of other advantages over today’s … First,
              total factor productivity growth was much greater. The decade saw
              the most rapid adoption of the advances in power and transportation
              that had grown up from the 1880s. The result was U.S. TFP growth of
              around 2% annually, about double the recent rate. This generated an
              explosion in living standards during the decade.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Second, the “Downton Abbey economy” had much lower asset prices
              because of higher interest rates and much easier construction
              procedures. Shares paid higher dividends and were much lower valued
              in terms of assets and earnings, while leverage ratios were
              infinitely more conservative. The world was used to a gold standard,
              in which leverage could kill you in a downturn, and was much more
              careful about incurring it. Real estate was valued at its rebuilding
              cost, and rebuilding costs were much lower than today because there
              were no planning approvals and no environmental-impact statements. I
              have written several times about the extraordinary inflation of
              infrastructure costs, from the 1920-27 Holland Tunnel’s $48 million,
              equivalent to $700 million in today’s prices to the outrageous
              projected $9 billion of the recently cancelled Trans-Hudson Tunnel
              (functionally an identical project). In “Downton Abbey’s” world,
              real estate costs were modest and new infrastructure projects were
              built on time, at a fraction of today’s real cost.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Third, the “Downton Abbey” world had positive real interest rates
              and no inflation psychology. People could be assured that their
              efforts in saving would not be destroyed by inflation or by being
              dumped into an overvalued bubble stock market. While World War I had
              brought a doubling in prices in Britain and the United States,
              everyone expected that this process would be largely reversed,
              probably by a British return to the gold standard. Indeed, until
              World War II, those expectations were realized. For people planning
              their lives, it was a much easier era. In peacetime, money was a
              solid store of value, not something that had to be monitored
              constantly for inflationary erosion.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Finally, both the economic system and the financial system were
              carried on with high standards of integrity, more so in Britain than
              in the U.S., but higher in both countries than today. Banks,
              corporations and managers relied heavily on their reputation, and
              those doing business with them made careful enquiries about that
              reputation. There were few fallible government regulations, no
              bailouts and little leverage. A notable feature of the Bernard
              Madoff Ponzi scheme of 2008 was that it was able to attract about
              500 times as much money in real terms as the $3 million collected in
              1920 by the Charles Ponzi and carry on for about 40 times as long as
              Ponzi’s eight months. The ability of Madoff to grow so big and last
              so long is testimony to the futility of modern regulation and to the
              sad decline of ethical standards in today’s blue-chip houses.</em>

            marks the point where economics switches into ontology (and not in
            a good way). Global government debt issuance — undiminished in its
            absolute scale — has <em>for the first time</em> ever been entirely
            swallowed by money production. Postmodernism has unambiguously
            triumphed, at least temporarily. It’s a thing of wonder, and not a bad
            exemplification of objective evil (as Gnon acts upon it). Reality, for
            the moment, is benched. (This does not end well — but we know that,
            right?)

            <em>A true understanding of stock market history shows that Wall Street
              in the past has moved in long, long swings upwards and downwards,
              often taking years or even a generation or two. There is a great
              deal of evidence suggesting that the upward move that began in 1982
              is one of them — and that the downward move that first began in 2000
              has not ended.</em>

          <em>
            <p>
              As stock market historian Russell Napier points out in his book
              “Anatomy of the Bear,” on five occasions in the past 100 years — in
              1921, 1932, 1949, 1974 and 1982 — those big downward moves have not
              ended until share valuations have fallen to just 30% of the
              replacement cost of company assets. That’s using a powerful, if
              little-known, economic metric known as
              <a href="http://www.smithers.co.uk/page.php?id=34">Tobin’s q</a>.
              […] And, to cut to the chase, if Wall Street stocks followed the
              same path today that would take the Dow down to about 5,000, and the
              S&amp;P 500 Index all the way down to around 600. (The S&amp;P 500
              slumped more than 3% to 1,971 on Friday.) […] Yikes.

          <p>
            <em>The “q” is a valuation that they don’t even mention in the training
              manuals for the official “financial planner” and financial-analyst
              exams. Your money manager has probably never heard of it. Or, if he
              has, he probably ranks it with astrology and the mystic rantings of
              Nostradamus. […] But the “q” happens to have by far the most
              successful long-term track record of any stock market indicator.

            A Quick-and-Dirty Introduction to Accelerationism
          </h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Anyone trying to work out what they think about accelerationism better
          do so quickly. That’s the nature of the thing. It was already caught
          up with trends that seemed too fast to track when it began to become
          self-aware, decades ago. It has picked up a lot of speed since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accelerationism is old enough to have arrived in waves, which is to
          say insistently, or recurrently, and each time the challenge is more
          urgent. Among its predictions is the expectation that you’ll be too
          slow to deal with it coherently. Yet if you fumble the question it
          poses – because rushed – you lose, perhaps very badly. It’s hard. (For
          our purposes here “you” are standing in as a bearer of “the opinions
          of mankind”.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Time-pressure, by its very nature, is difficult to think about.
          Typically, while the opportunity for deliberation is not necessarily
          presumed, it is at least – with overwhelming likelihood – mistaken for
          an historical constant, rather than a variable. If there was ever time
          to think, we think, there still is and will always be. The definite
          probability that the allotment of time to decision-making is
          undergoing systematic compression remains a neglected consideration,
          even among those paying explicit and exceptional attention to the
          increasing rapidity of change.
        </p>
        <p>
          In philosophical terms, the deep problem of acceleration is
          <em>transcendental</em>. It describes an absolute horizon – and one
          that is closing in. Thinking takes time, and accelerationism suggests
          we’re running out of time to think that through, if we haven’t
          already. No contemporary dilemma is being entertained realistically
          until it is also acknowledged that the opportunity for doing so is
          fast collapsing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suspicion has to arrive that if a public conversation about
          acceleration is beginning, it’s just in time to be too late. The
          profound institutional crisis that makes the topic ‘hot’ has at its
          core an implosion of social decision-making capability. Doing
          anything, at this point, would take too long. So instead, events
          increasingly just happen. They seem ever more out of control, even to
          a traumatic extent. Because the basic phenomenon appears to be a brake
          failure, accelerationism is picked up again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accelerationism links the implosion of decision-space to the explosion
          of the world – that is, to modernity. It is important therefore to
          note that the conceptual opposition between implosion and explosion
          does nothing to impede their real (mechanical) coupling. Thermonuclear
          weapons provide the most vividly illuminating examples. An H-bomb
          employs an A-bomb as a trigger. A fission reaction sparks a fusion
          reaction. The fusion mass is crushed into ignition by a blast process.
          (Modernity is a blast.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is already to be talking about cybernetics, which also returns
          insistently, in waves. It amplifies to howl, and then dissipates into
          the senseless babble of fashion, until the next blast-wave hits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For accelerationism the crucial lesson was this: A negative feedback
          circuit – such as a steam-engine ‘governor’ or a thermostat –
          functions to keep some state of a system in the same place. Its
          product, in the language formulated by French philosophical
          cyberneticists Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, is
          <em>territorialization</em>. Negative feedback stabilizes a process,
          by correcting drift, and thus inhibiting departure beyond a limited
          range. Dynamics are placed in the service of fixity – a higher-level
          stasis, or state. All equilibrium models of complex systems and
          processes are like this. To capture the contrary trend, characterized
          by self-reinforcing errancy, flight, or escape, D&amp;G coin the
          inelegant but influential term <em>deterritorialization</em>.
          Deterritorialization is the only thing accelerationism has ever really
          talked about.
        </p>
        <p>
          In socio-historical terms, the line of deterritorialization
          corresponds to <em>uncompensated capitalism</em>. The basic – and, of
          course, to some real highly consequential degree
          <em>actually installed</em> – schema is a positive feedback circuit,
          within which commercialization and industrialization mutually excite
          each other in a runaway process, from which modernity draws its
          gradient. Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche were among those to
          capture important aspects of the trend. As the circuit is
          incrementally closed, or intensified, it exhibits ever greater
          autonomy, or automation. It becomes more tightly
          <em>auto-productive</em> (which is only what ‘positive feedback’
          already says). Because it appeals to nothing beyond itself, it is
          inherently nihilistic. It has no conceivable meaning beside
          self-amplification. It grows in order to grow. Mankind is its
          temporary host, not its master. Its only purpose is itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Accelerate the process,” recommended Deleuze &amp; Guattari in their
          1972 <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, citing Nietzsche to re-activate Marx.
          Although it would take another four decades before “accelerationism”
          was named as such, critically, by Benjamin Noys, it was already there,
          in its entirety. The relevant passage is worth repeating in full (as
          it would be, repeatedly, in all subsequent accelerationist
          discussion):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            … which is the revolutionary path? Is there one?—To withdraw from
            the world market, as Samir Amin advises Third World countries to do,
            in a curious revival of the fascist “economic solution”? Or might it
            be to go in the opposite direction? To go still further, that is, in
            the movement of the market, of decoding and deterritorialization?
            For perhaps the flows are not yet deterritorialized enough, not
            decoded enough, from the viewpoint of a theory and a practice of a
            highly schizophrenic character. Not to withdraw from the process,
            but to go further, to “accelerate the process,” as Nietzsche put it:
            in this matter, the truth is that we haven’t seen anything yet.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The point of an analysis of capitalism, or of nihilism, is to do more
          of it. <em>The process</em> is not to be critiqued. The process
          <em>is</em> the critique, feeding back into itself, as it escalates.
          The only way forward is through, which means further in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marx has his own ‘accelerationist fragment’ which anticipates the
          passage from <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> remarkably. He says in an 1848
          speech ‘On the Question of Free Trade’:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            …in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while
            the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities
            and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to
            the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the
            social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone,
            gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In this germinal accelerationist matrix, there is no distinction to be
          made between the destruction of capitalism and its intensification.
          The auto-destruction of capitalism is what capitalism is. “Creative
          destruction” is the whole of it, beside only its retardations, partial
          compensations, or inhibitions. Capital revolutionizes itself more
          thoroughly than any extrinsic ‘revolution’ possibly could. If
          subsequent history has not vindicated this point beyond all question,
          it has at least simulated such a vindication, to a maddening degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams sought to resolve this
          intolerable – even ‘schizophrenic’ – ambivalence in their ‘Manifesto
          for an Accelerationist Politics,’ which aimed to precipitate a
          specifically anti-capitalist ‘Left-accelerationism’, clearly
          demarcated over against its abominably pro-capitalist
          ‘Right-accelerationist’ shadow. This project – predictably – was more
          successful at re-animating the accelerationist question than at
          ideologically purifying it in any sustainable way. It was only by
          introducing a wholly artificial distinction between capitalism and
          modernistic technological acceleration that their boundary lines could
          be drawn at all. The implicit call was for a new Leninism without the
          NEP (and with the Utopian techno-managerial experiments of Chilean
          communism drawn upon for illustration).
        </p>
        <p>
          Capital, in its ultimate self-definition, is
          <em>nothing beside</em> the abstract accelerative social factor. Its
          positive cybernetic schema exhausts it. Runaway consumes its identity.
          Every other determination is shucked-off as an accident, at some stage
          of its intensification process. Since anything able to consistently
          feed socio-historical acceleration will necessarily, or by essence,
          <em>be capital</em>, the prospect of any unambiguously
          ‘Left-accelerationism’ gaining serious momentum can be confidently
          dismissed. Accelerationism is simply the self-awareness of capitalism,
          which has scarcely begun. (“We haven’t seen anything yet.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of writing, Left-accelerationism appears to have
          deconstructed itself back into traditional socialist politics, and the
          accelerationist torch has passed to a new generation of brilliant
          young thinkers advancing an ‘Unconditional Accelerationism’ (neither
          R/Acc., or L/Acc., but U/Acc.). Their online identities – if not in
          any easily extricable way their ideas – can be searched-out through
          the peculiar social-media hash-tag #Rhetttwitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          As blockchains, drone logistics, nanotechnology, quantum computing,
          computational genomics, and virtual reality flood in, drenched in
          ever-higher densities of artificial intelligence, accelerationism
          won’t be going anywhere, unless ever deeper into itself. To be rushed
          by the phenomenon, to the point of terminal institutional paralysis,
          <em>is</em> the phenomenon. Naturally – which is to say completely
          inevitably – the human species will define this ultimate terrestrial
          event as a problem. To see it is already to say:
          <em>We have to do something</em>. To which accelerationism can only
          respond:
          <em>You’re finally saying that now? Perhaps we ought to get started? </em>In its colder variants, which are
          those that win out, it tends to
          laugh.

          <h5>
            <em>Doubling down on Moore’s Law is the futurist main current</em>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Cycles cannot be dismissed from futuristic speculation (they always
            come back), but they no longer define it. Since the beginning of the
            electronic era, their contribution to the shape of the future has been
            progressively marginalized.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model of linear and irreversible historical time, originally
            inherited from Occidental religious traditions, was spliced together
            with ideas of continuous growth and improvement during the industrial
            revolution. During the second half of the 20th century, the dynamics
            of electronics manufacture consolidated a further – and fundamental –
            upgrade, based upon the expectation of continuously accelerating
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elementary arithmetic of counting along the natural number line
            provides an intuitively comfortable model for the progression of time,
            due to its conformity with clocks, calendars, and the simple idea of
            succession. Yet the dominant historical forces of the modern world
            promote a significantly different model of change, one that tends to
            shift addition upwards, into an exponent. Demographics, capital
            accumulation, and technological performance indices do not increase
            through unitary steps, but through rates of return, doublings, and
            take-offs. Time explodes, exponentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The iconic expression of this neo-modern time, counting succession in
            binary logarithms, is Moore’s Law, which determines a two-year
            doubling period for the density of transistors on microchips
            (“cramming more components onto integrated circuits”). In a short
            <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/moores-law-lives-the-future-is-still-alive/" target="_blank">essay</a>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Today, almost a half-century after it was first elucidated by
              legendary Fairchild and Intel co-founder Dr. Gordon Moore in an
              article for a trade magazine, it is increasingly apparent that
              Moore’s Law is the defining measure of the modern world. All other
              predictive tool for understanding life in the developed world since
              WWII — demographics, productivity tables, literacy rates,
              econometrics, the cycles of history, Marxist analysis, and on and on
              — have failed to predict the trajectory of society over the decades
              … except Moore’s Law.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Whilst crystallizing – <em>in silico</em> — the inherent acceleration
            of neo-modern, linear time, Moore’s Law is intrinsically nonlinear,
            for at least two reasons. Firstly, and most straightforwardly, it
            expresses the positive feedback dynamics of technological
            industrialism, in which rapidly-advancing electronic machines
            continuously revolutionize their own manufacturing infrastructure.
            Better chips make better robots make better chips, in a spiraling
            acceleration. Secondly, Moore’s Law is at once an observation, and a
            program. As Wikipedia
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_Law" target="_blank">notes</a>:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “[Moore’s original] paper noted that the number of components in
              integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the
              integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965 and predicted that the trend
              would continue ‘for at least ten years’. His prediction has proved
              to be uncannily accurate, in part because the law is now used in the
              semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set
              targets for research and development. … Although Moore’s law was
              initially made in the form of an observation and forecast, the more
              widely it became accepted, the more it served as a goal for an
              entire industry. This drove both marketing and engineering
              departments of semiconductor manufacturers to focus enormous energy
              aiming for the specified increase in processing power that it was
              presumed one or more of their competitors would soon actually
              attain. In this regard, it can be viewed as a self-fulfilling
              prophecy.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Malone comments:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “… semiconductor companies around the world, big and small, and not
              least because of their respect for Gordon Moore, set out to uphold
              the Law — and they have done so ever since, despite seemingly
              impossible technical and scientific obstacles. Gordon Moore not only
              discovered Moore’s Law, he made it real. As his successor at Intel,
              Paul Otellini, once told me, ‘I’m not going to be the guy whose
              legacy is that Moore’s Law died on his watch.'”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            If Technological Singularity is the ‘rapture of the nerds’, Gordon
            Moore is their Moses. Electro-industrial capitalism is told to go
            forth and multiply, and to do so with a quite precisely time-specified
            binary exponent. In its adherence to the Law, the integrated circuit
            industry is uniquely chosen (and a light unto the peoples). As Malone
            concludes:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Today, every segment of society either embraces Moore’s Law or is
              racing to get there. That’s because they know that if only they can
              get aboard that rocket — that is, if they can add a digital
              component to their business — they too can accelerate away from the
              competition. That’s why none of the inventions we Baby Boomers as
              kids expected to enjoy as adults — atomic cars! personal
              helicopters! ray guns! — have come true; and also why we have even
              more powerful tools and toys ��instead. Whatever can be made
              digital, if not in the whole, but in part — marketing,
              communications, entertainment, genetic engineering, robotics,
              warfare, manufacturing, service, finance, sports — it will, because
              going digital means jumping onto Moore’s Law. Miss that train and,
              as a business, an institution, or a cultural phenomenon, you die.”

            — and thus a “self-fulfilling prophecy” — exponential nonlinearity
            writes itself into reality. Is Moore’s Law the clearest example of
            ontological auto-production that we have?
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably: Moore’s Law feature miniaturization heads inexorably towards
            the atomic scale (by ~2020) and thus the threshold of quantum
            computation, which raises the exponentiation to a higher power. A
            single 300 qubit machine would realize a greater computational power
            than that currently instantiated in the entire global stock of
            electronic devices (since every qubit is a binary exponent).

          </a>
          <p>
            For the intellectual-historical foundations of Accelerationism there’s
            one obvious
            <a href="http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_accelerate.php">place</a> to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            A search for its conceptual foundations, however, allows of short
            cuts.
            <a href="http://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf">This</a> is one of
            them (and an extraordinarily valuable one).
          </p>
          <p>
            Yudkowsky does not write of ‘acceleration’ but of “returns on
            cognitive reinvestment” as the basic problem of “intelligence
            explosion microeconomics”. The topic is quite clearly
            <em>identical</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The explosion of ethico-political anguish around the Accelerationist
            thesis tends to obscure the fundamental conceptual issues. This paper
            is a crucial corrective.

            <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/" target="_blank">Eliezer Yudkowski</a>
            now categorizes his article ‘<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/singularity.html"
              target="_blank">Staring
              into Singularity</a>‘ as ‘obsolete’. Yet it remains among the most brilliant
            philosophical essays ever written. Rarely, if ever, has so much of
            value been said about the absolutely unthinkable (or, more
            specifically, the absolutely unthinkable <em>for us</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, Yudkowsky scarcely pauses at the phenomenon of
            exponential growth, despite the fact that this already overtaxes all
            comfortable intuition and ensures revolutionary changes of such
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem" target="_blank">magnitude</a>
            that speculation falters. He is adamant that exponentiation (even
            <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/kurzweils-law-aka-the-law-of-accelerating-returns"
              target="_blank">Kurzweil</a>‘s ‘double exponentiation’) only reaches the starting point of
            computational acceleration, and that propulsion into Singularity is
            not exponential, but hyperbolic.

          <p>
            Each time the speed of thought doubles, time-schedules halve. When
            technology, including the design of intelligences, succumbs to such
            dynamics, it becomes recursive. The rate of self-improvement collapses
            with smoothly increasing rapidity towards instantaneity: a true,
            mathematically exact, or punctual Singularity. What lies beyond is not
            merely difficult to imagine, it is absolutely inconceivable.
            Attempting to picture or describe it is a ridiculous futility. Science
            fiction dies.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “A group of human-equivalent computers spends 2 years to double
              computer speeds. Then they spend another 2 subjective years, or 1
              year in human terms, to double it again. Then they spend another 2
              subjective years, or six months, to double it again. After four
              years total, the computing power goes to infinity.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is the ‘Transcended’ version of the doubling sequence. Let’s
              call the ‘Transcend’ of a sequence {a0, a1, a2…} the function where
              the interval between a<em>n</em> and a<em>n</em>+1 is inversely
              proportional to a<em>n</em>. So a Transcended doubling function
              starts with 1, in which case it takes 1 time-unit to go to 2. Then
              it takes 1/2 time-units to go to 4. Then it takes 1/4 time-units to
              go to 8. This function, if it were continuous, would be the
              hyperbolic function y = 2/(2 – x). When x = 2, then (2 – x) = 0 and
              y = infinity. The behavior at that point is known mathematically as
              a singularity.”

          <p>
            There could scarcely be a more precise, plausible, or consequential
            formula: Doubling periods halve. On the slide into Singularity —

              target="_blank">intelligence
              explosion</a>‘ — exponentiation is compounded by a hyperbolic trend. The
            arithmetic of such a process is quite simple, but its historical
            implications are strictly incomprehensible.

              how utterly, finally, absolutely impossible it is to think like
              someone even a little tiny bit smarter than you are. I know that we
              are all missing the obvious, every day. There are no hard problems,
              only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence. Move
              the smallest bit upwards, and some problems will suddenly move from
              ‘impossible’ to ‘obvious’. Move a substantial degree upwards, and
              all of them will become obvious. Move a huge distance upwards… “

            Since the argument takes human thought to its shattering point, it is
            natural for some to be repulsed by it. Yet its basics are almost
            impregnable to logical objection. Intelligence is a function of the
            brain. The brain has been ‘designed’ by natural processes (posing no
            discernible special difficulties). Thus, intelligence is obviously an
            ultimately tractable engineering problem. Nature has already
            ‘engineered it’ whilst employing design methods of such stupefying
            inefficiency that only brute, obstinate force, combined of course with
            complete ruthlessness, have moved things forwards. Yet the tripling of
            cortical mass within the lineage of the higher primates has only taken
            a few million years, and — for most of this period — a modest
            experimental population (in the low millions or less).

          <p>
            The contemporary technological problem, in contrast to the preliminary
            biological one, is vastly easier. It draws upon a wider range of
            materials and techniques, an installed intelligence and knowledge
            base, superior information media, more highly-dynamized feedback
            systems, and a self-amplifying resource network. Unsurprisingly it is
            advancing at incomparably greater speed.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “If we had a time machine, 100K of information from the future could
              specify a protein that built a device that would give us
              nanotechnology overnight. 100K could contain the code for a seed AI.
              Ever since the late 90’s, the Singularity has been only a problem of
              software. And software is information, the magic stuff that changes
              at arbitrarily high speeds. As far as technology is concerned, the
              Singularity could happen tomorrow. One breakthrough – just one major
              insight – in the science of protein engineering or atomic
              manipulation or Artificial Intelligence, one really good day at
              Webmind or Zyvex, and the door to Singularity sweeps open.”

            <p>
              As the natural sciences have developed to encompass increasingly
              complex systems, scientific rationality has become ever more
              statistical, or probabilistic. The deterministic classical mechanics
              of the enlightenment was revolutionized by the near-equilibrium
              statistical mechanics of late 19th century atomists, by quantum
              mechanics in the early 20th century, and by the far-from-equilibrium
              complexity theorists of the later 20th century. Mathematical
              neo-Darwinism, information theory, and quantitative social sciences
              compounded the trend. Forces, objects, and natural types were
              progressively dissolved into statistical distributions: heterogeneous
              clouds, entropy deviations, wave functions, gene frequencies,
              noise-signal ratios and redundancies, dissipative structures, and
              complex systems at the edge of chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the final decades of the 20th century, an unbounded probabilism was
              expanding into hitherto unimagined territories, testing deeply
              unfamiliar and counter-intuitive arguments in statistical metaphysics,
              or statistical ontology. It no longer sufficed for realism to attend
              to multiplicities, because reality was itself subject to
              multiplication.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his declaration <em>cogito ergo sum</em>, Descartes concluded
              (perhaps optimistically) that the existence of the self could be
              safely concluded from the fact of thinking. The statistical
              ontologists inverted this formula, asking: given my existence (which
              is to say, an existence that seems like this to me), what kind of
              reality is probable? Which reality is this likely to be?

                  Children</a></em>,
              seems to have initiated the genre. Extrapolating Moore’s Law into
              the not-too-distant future, he anticipated computational capacities
              that exceeded those of all biological brains by many orders of
              magnitude. Since each human brain runs its own more-or-less competent
              simulation of the world in order to function, it seemed natural to
              expect the coming technospheric intelligences to do the same, but with
              vastly greater scope, resolution, and variety. The mass replication of
              robot brains, each billions or trillions of times more powerful than
              those of its human progenitors, would provide a substrate for
              innumerable, immense, and minutely detailed historical simulations,
              within which human intelligences could be reconstructed to an
              effectively-perfect level of fidelity.
            </p>
            <p>
              This vision feeds into a burgeoning literature on non-biological
              mental substrates, consciousness uploading, mind clones, whole-brain
              emulations (‘ems’), and Matrix-style artificial realities. Since the
              realities we presently know are already simulated (let us momentarily
              assume) on biological signal-processing systems with highly-finite
              quantitative specifications, there is no reason to confidently
              anticipate that an ‘artificial’ reality simulation would be in any way
              distinguishable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is ‘this’ history or its simulation? More precisely: is ‘this’ a
              contemporary biological (brain-based) simulation, or a reconstructed,
              artificial memory, run on a technological substrate ‘in the future’?
              That is a question without classical solution, Moravec argues. It can
              only be approached, rigorously, with statistics, and since the number
              of fine-grained simulated histories (unknown but probably vast),
              overwhelmingly exceeds the number of actual or original histories (for
              the sake of this argument, one), then the probabilistic calculus
              points unswervingly towards a definite conclusion: we can be
              near-certain that we are inhabitants of a simulation run by artificial
              (or post-biological) intelligences at some point in ‘our future’. At
              least – since many alternatives present themselves – we can be
              extremely confident, on grounds of statistical ontology, that our
              existence is non-original (if not historical reconstruction, it might
              be a game or fiction).
            </p>
            <p>
              Nick Bostrom formalizes the simulation argument in his article ‘The
              Simulation Argument: Why the Probability that You are Living in the
              Matrix is Quite High’ (found
              <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank">here</a>):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>Now we get to the core of the simulation argument. This does not
                  purport to demonstrate that you are in a simulation. Instead, it
                  shows that we should accept as true at least one of the following
                  three propositions:</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>(1) The chances that a species at our current level of
                  development can avoid going extinct before becoming
                  technologically mature is negligibly small</em><br />
                <em>
                  (2) Almost no technologically mature civilisations are interested
                  in running computer simulations of minds like ours</em><br />
                <em> (3) You are almost certainly in a simulation.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Each of these three propositions may be prima facie implausible;
                  yet, if the simulation argument is correct, at least one is true
                  (it does not tell us which).</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              If obstacles to the existence of high-level simulations (1 and 2) are
              removed, then statistical reasoning takes over, following the exact
              track laid down by Moravec. We are “almost certainly” inhabiting a
              “computer simulation that was created by some advanced civilization”
              because these saturate to near-exhaustion the probability space for
              realities ‘like this’. If such simulations exist, original lives would
              be as unlikely as winning lottery tickets, at best.
            </p>
            <p>Bostrom concludes with an intriguing and influential twist:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>If we are in a simulation, is it possible that we could know that
                  for certain? If the simulators don’t want us to find out, we
                  probably never will. But if they choose to reveal themselves, they
                  could certainly do so. Maybe a window informing you of the fact
                  would pop up in front of you, or maybe they would “upload” you
                  into their world. Another event that would let us conclude with a
                  very high degree of confidence that we are in a simulation is if
                  we ever reach the point where we are about to switch on our own
                  simulations. If we start running simulations, that would be very
                  strong evidence against (1) and (2). That would leave us with only
                  (3).</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              If we create fine-grained reality simulations, we demonstrate – to a
              high level of statistical confidence – that we already inhabit one,
              and that the history leading up to this moment of creation was fake.

            <h4 class="post-title">Anthropocene</h4>
          </a>
          <h5><em>Human history is geology on speed</em></h5>
          <p>
            Complex systems, characterized by high (and rising local) negative
            entropy, are essentially historical. The sciences devoted to them tend
            inevitably to become evolutionary, as exemplified by the course of the
            earth- and life-sciences – which had become thoroughly historicized by
            the late 19th century. Perhaps the most elegant, abstract, or ‘cosmic’
            comprehension of this necessity is found in the work of Vladimir
            Ivanovich
            <a href="http://www.tstu.ru/en/tambov/kultur/nauka/vernad/uchver.htm" target="_blank">Vernadsky</a>
            (1863-1945), whose visionary writings sought to establish the basis
            for an integrated understanding of terrestrial history, conceived as a
            process of material acceleration through geochemical epochs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the philosophical power of his ideas, Vernadsky’s scientific
            training as a chemist anchored his thoughts in concrete, literal
            reality. The acceleration of the terrestrial process was more than an
            anthropocentric impression, registering socially and culturally
            significant change (such as the cephalization of the primate lineage
            leading to mankind). Geochemical evolution was physically expressed
            through the average velocity of particles, as biological metabolism
            (biosphere), and eventually human cultures (noosphere), introduced and
            propagated ever more intense networks of chemical reactions. Life is
            matter in a hurry, culture even more so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst Vernadsky has been sporadically rediscovered and celebrated,
            his importance – based on the profundity, rigor, and supreme relevance
            of his work — has yet to be fully and universally acknowledged. Yet it
            is possible that his time is finally arriving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The May 28 – June 3 edition of <em>The Economist</em> devotes an
            <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18744401?Story_ID=18744401" target="_blank">editorial</a>
            and major feature
            <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18741749" target="_blank">story</a>
            to the Anthropocene – a distinctive geological epoch proposed by Paul
            Crutzen in 2000, now under consideration by the International
            Commission on Stratigraphy (the “ultimate adjudicator of the
            geological time scale”). Recognition of the Anthropocene would be an
            acknowledgement that we inhabit a geological epoch whose physical
            signature has been fundamentally re-shaped by the technological forces
            of the ‘noosphere’ or ‘ethosphere’ – in which human intelligence has
            been introduced as a massive (and even dominant) force of nature.
            Radical metamorphosis (and acceleration) of the earth’s nitrogen and
            carbon cycles are especially pronounced Anthropocene signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The term ‘paradigm shift’ is bandied around with promiscuous ease,”
            <em>The Economist</em> notes. “But for the natural sciences to make
            human activity central to its conception of the world, rather than a
            distraction, would mark such a shift for real.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Third Reich master architect Albert Speer is notorious for his
            promotion of ‘ruin value’ – the persistent grandeur of monumental
            constructions, encountered by archaeologists in the far future. The
            Anthropocene introduces a similar perspective on a still vaster scale.
            As
            <em>The Economist</em> remarks:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>The most common way of distinguishing periods of geological time
                is by means of the fossils they contain. On this basis picking out
                the Anthropocene in the rocks of days to come will be pretty easy.
                Cities will make particularly distinctive fossils. A city on a
                fast-sinking river delta (and fast-sinking deltas, undermined by
                the pumping of groundwater and starved of sediment by dams
                upstream, are common Anthropocene environments) could spend
                millions of years buried and still, when eventually uncovered,
                reveal through its crushed structures and weird mixtures of
                materials that it is unlike anything else in the geological
                record.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As terrestrial history accelerates, the distinctive units of
            geological time are compressed. The Archean and Proterozoic
            <em>aeons</em> are measured in billions of years, the Palaeozoic and
            Mesozoic <em>eras</em> in hundreds of millions, the Palaeogene and
            Neogene <em>periods</em> in tens of millions. The Holocene
            <em>epoch</em> lasts less than 10,000 years, and the Anthropocene (<em>epoch</em>
            or mere <em>phase</em>?) only centuries – because its recognition is
            already an indication of its end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the Anthropocene lies the Technocene, distinguished by
            nanotechnological manipulation of matter — a geochemical revolution of
            such magnitude that only the assembly of (RNA and DNA) replicator
            molecules is comparable in implication. Within the coming Technocene
            (lasting mere decades?), the carbon cycle is relayed through
            sub-microscopic manufacturing processes that utilize it as the
            ultimate industrial resource – feedstock for diamondoid nanomachine
            fabrication. The consequences for geological deposition, and thus for
            the discoveries of potential distant-future geologists, are
            substantial but opaque. On the far-side of nanomachined age,
            femtomachines await, precisely assembled from quarks, and decomposing
            chemistry into nuclear physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the moment, however, even the origination of the Anthropocene –
            never mind its termination – remains a matter of live controversy.
            Assuming that it coincides with industrialization (which is
            <a href="http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Ruddiman2003.pdf" target="_blank">not
              universally accepted</a>), geologists will find themselves enmeshed in a debate among
            historians, as the fraught term ‘modernity’ takes on a geochemical
            definition. Whatever the outcome, Vernadsky is back.

            <h4 class="post-title">Technological Determination</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism">Technological determinism</a>‘ is among
            those
            theoretical traits (‘naturalistic fallacy’ is
            another) which tend immediately to provoke an attitude of complacent
            intellectual superiority, rather than cognitive engagement. Merely to
            identify it is typically judged sufficient for a dismissal. If TD
            <em>as such</em> poses a question, it is easily missed.
          </p>
          <p>
            One under-examined question might be:
            <em>Why is technological determinism so plausible in modern societies,
              and ever more so as they modernize?</em>
            Is the balance of social determination within society itself an
            unstable historical variable, with unmistakable positive trend?
          </p>
          <p>
            Two recent popular stories of relevance stray quite naively into the
            pre-set cross-hairs of the critique. In <em>The Atlantic</em>, Erik
            Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee
            <a
              href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/the-dawn-of-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/283730/">announce</a>
            the Dawn of the Second Machine Age, while Google-God of the TDs Ray
            Kurzweil conveys his
            <a
              href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2565948/Computer-robots-outsmart-humans-15-years-Google-director-claims-giant-laboratory-artificial-intelligence-planned.html#ixzz2uCSGnRTE">prediction</a>
            (through the UK’s <em>Daily Mail</em>) that “Robots will be smarter
            than the most intelligent humans within the next 15 years.” The
            sophisticated will scoff — without consequence.
          </p>
          <p><span id="more-280"></span>Some quick reasons not to scoff:</p>
          <p>
            (1) Advanced technology roughly follows Moore’s Law, and predicts a
            commensurate impact upon growth. In the absence of such growth, it
            becomes increasingly difficult to avoid noticing a
            <em>compensation mechanism</em>, which rebalances through systematic
            retardation what is perturbed through development. TD is indeed
            partial, because it has no account of what is holding it back. Once
            this is recognized, however, it depicts its other more realistically
            (as orchestrated suppression) than the suppressor can account for
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) The combination of socio-political failure with techno-economic
            achievement — emerging with impressive definition from the global net
            growth equation — is only secondarily a matter of conceptual clarity.
            Primarily it is a <em>splitting</em>, or breaking away, in which
            technological determinism represents the dynamic instance, and
            sophisticated socio-cultural critique represents — in reality — the
            counter-dynamic, or retardant entity. The attempt to ‘put technology
            in its place’ that is from one side a matter of theoretically
            self-evident comprehensive reason is, from the other, the increasingly
            comical attempt by a parasite to justify its relation to its host.
            (This is another opportunity to recommend Andrea Castillo’s
            <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/02/11/the-wired-mans-burden/">overview</a>.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) Whatever technology can do, it is doing, at an accelerating pace.
            As it advances, ideas about the ‘limits of the technological’ are
            automatically obsolesced. Condescending to a steam engine is one
            thing, attempting the same with an artificial super-intelligence quite
            another. Critical smugness has an outer horizon.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We want [computers] to read everything on the web and every page of
            every book, then be able to engage in intelligent dialogue with the
            user to be able to answer their questions,” explains Kurzweil.
            <em>So what do you think about this technological determinism
              nonsense?</em>
            we will soon be able to ask, superciliously.

            <h5><em>Two unusual little girls test the limits of identity</em></h5>
            <p>
              At the leading-edge of information technology — and amongst the
              ‘transhumanist’ commentary it stimulates – the idea of self-identity
              is undergoing relentless interrogation. Cultures substantially
              influenced by Abrahamic religious traditions, in which the resilient
              integrity and fundamental individuality of the ‘soul’ is strongly
              emphasized, are especially vulnerable to the prospect of radical and
              disconcerting conceptual revision.

            <p>
              The computerization of the natural sciences – including neurosciences
              – ensures that the investigation of the human brain and the innovation
              of artificial intelligence systems advance in parallel, whilst
              cross-linking and mutually reinforcing each other. Increasingly, the
              understanding of the brain and its digital emulation tend to fuse into
              a single, complex research program. As this program emerges, archaic
              metaphysics and spiritual doctrines become engineering problems.
              Individual identity seems ever less like a basic property, and more
              like a precarious achievement – or challenge – determined by processes
              of self-reference, and by relative communicative isolation.
              (‘Split-brain’ cases have vividly

              Would an AI program – or brain – that was tightly coupled to the
              Internet by high-bandwidth connections still consider itself to be
              strictly individuated? Do cyborgs – or uploads — dissolve their souls?
              Could a networked robot say ‘I’ and mean it? Because such questions
              are becoming ever more prominent, and practical, it is not surprising
              that a New York Times
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/magazine/could-conjoined-twins-share-a-mind.html?_r=1&amp;hp"
                target="_blank">story</a>
              by Susan Dominus, devoted to craniopagus conjoined twins Krista and
              Tatiana Hogan, has generated an unusual quantity of excitement and
              Internet-linkage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The twins are not only fused at the head (craniopagus), their brains
              are connected by a ‘neural bridge’ that enables signals from one to
              the other. Neurosurgeon Douglas Cochrane proposes “that visual input
              comes in through the retinas of one girl, reaches her thalamus, then
              takes two different courses, like electricity traveling along a wire
              that splits in two. In the girl who is looking at the strobe or a
              stuffed animal in her crib, the visual input continues on its usual
              pathways, one of which ends up in the visual cortex. In the case of
              the other girl, the visual stimulus would reach her thalamus via the
              thalamic bridge, and then travel up her own visual neural circuitry,
              ending up in the sophisticated processing centers of her own visual
              cortex. Now she has seen it, probably milliseconds after her sister
              has.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The twins’ brains, or a twin-brain? The Hogan case is so extraordinary
              that irreducible ambiguity arises:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>The girls’ brains are so unusually formed that doctors could not
                  predict what their development would be like: each girl has an
                  unusually short corpus callosum, the neural band that allows the
                  brain’s two cerebral hemispheres to communicate, and in each girl,
                  the two cerebral hemispheres also differ in size, with Tatiana’s
                  left sphere and Krista’s right significantly smaller than is
                  typical. “The asymmetry raises intriguing questions about whether
                  one can compensate for the other because of the brain bridge,”
                  said Partha Mitra, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor
                  Laboratory, who studies brain architecture. The girls’ cognition
                  may also be facing specific challenges that no others have
                  experienced: some kind of confusing crosstalk that would require
                  additional energy to filter and process. In addition to sorting
                  out the usual sensory experiences of the world, the girls’ brains,
                  their doctors believe, have been forced to adapt to sensations
                  originating with the organs and body parts of someone else. …
                  Krista likes ketchup, and Tatiana does not, something the family
                  discovered when Tatiana tried to scrape the condiment off her own
                  tongue, even when she was not eating it.</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              As they struggle to make sense of their boundaries, the twins are
              avatars of an impending, universal confusion:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <em>Although each girl often used “I” when she spoke, I never heard
                  either say “we,” for all their collaboration. It was as if even
                  they seemed confused by how to think of themselves, with the right
                  language perhaps eluding them at this stage of development, under
                  these unusual circumstances — or maybe not existing at all. “It’s
                  like they are one and two people at the same time,” said Feinberg,
                  the professor of psychiatry and neurology at Albert Einstein
                  College of Medicine. What pronoun captures that?</em>

            The step from lunatic science fiction speculation to established

            That’s acceleration as it concretely happens. It’s not a new topic for
            prolonged thought, it’s the fact that the time for prolonged thought —
            and its associated space for collective ethico-political consideration
            — is no longer ever going to be available.

            <em>Alien Ecologies</em>, Craig Hickman
            <a href="http://darkecologies.com/2014/06/09/accelerationism-the-new-prometheans-part-one/">embarks</a>
            on a multi-part recapitulation of Accelerationism. His decision to
            frame it as ‘Promethean’ generates plenty of material for discussion,
            even before leaving the title. With the first installment poised on
            the brink of the Williams &amp; Srnicek
            <em>Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics</em>, it is set to
            provide the most comprehensive overview of the current to date. (See
            Hickman’s contribution to his own comment thread for a sense of the
            overall structure.)
          </p>
          <p>
            One emerging theme — from Hickman’s text and its nimbus — is the
            irreducible significance of Accelerationism as a symptom, which is to
            say: as a register of capitalist stimulus. Questions concerning its
            potential for cultural endurance twist, almost immediately, into
            estimations of techonomic provocation. The archetypal critique of
            accelerationism takes the form:
            <em>Capital has no right to excite us</em>. There is a slippage into
            highly-charged ethico-aesthetic controversy (as Hickman notes).
            <em>It <strong>should</strong> not be enthralling</em>.

            “… capitalism is anything but exciting. It is mundane, boring” says
            Edmund Berger, in the comments. However inane such a statement might
            sound, it conveys a complex thesis, of remarkable pertinence,
            insistence, and significance, and of far greater practical importance
            than any merely technical objection could be. It will be necessary to
            say much more about it, at some future point. For now, the most
            pressing response is a superficially trivial one: How much
            geo-historical sadness finds itself reflected in such a stance?

            As new media systems become (intimately annexed) parts of people’s
            brains, thinking <em>about</em> them is conducted through them. To
            some considerable extent, they are twisted through people, in order to
            think about themselves. The spiral of involvement is already at work.
            It becomes increasingly compelling to think (about) how it thinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blogs accelerated the media circuits of composition, publication,
            feedback interactivity, and revision. Writing became unprecedentedly
            ‘conversational’ and rapidly responsive to its own effects, which is
            to say: nonlinear. As culture adapted to Cyberspace it was shaped by
            <em>torsion</em>, susceptible as never before to capture by
            self-sustaining eddies or ‘singularities’ with unanticipated wandering
            vectors of their own. Pursuing a line of thought, while always
            experimental, was now intricately entangled with estrangement as never
            before. The ‘inner’ threads of memory — binding cognition to an
            experience of subjective integrity — stretched beyond their natural
            tolerances and succumbed to technical substitution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-264"></span>Twitter accelerates this process further —
            much further. Each tweet is a micro-completion, and thus an
            opportunity for the termination of memory. Rather than following the
            internal chain of its own thoughts, or remembering what it is thinking
            about, the twitter mind immerses itself in the information stream,
            where interaction takes over. The frenetic stimulus and feedback from
            incoming messages pulverizes attention, returning continuity through
            exteriority, as a staccato succession of feedback signals — responses,
            favorings, and retweets. The thread of thought has been pulled free
            from the self-contained, organic mind (or from its long-enduring
            persuasive illusion).
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘cultural critique’ of this amnesiac, distracted, obsessive,
            jittering intelligence almost writes itself. Twitter is undoubtedly
            junk. Its addictiveness, however, is by no means the least of its
            lessons. Tight feedback-circuitry (or cybernetic intensity) is
            inherently enthralling, irrespective of any extraneous ‘rewards’. The
            brain tends automatically to dynamic interconnection, even when the
            cost is a comprehensive surrender of identity. Whatever is coming will
            have sucked us in, before we get to decide what we think about it. The
            trend would be starkly obvious, if we could only remember where we
            have been.

            Googling “Twitter is dead” pulls up nearly two billion hits, which
            isn’t an obvious indication of vitality. Adrienne LaFrance and
            Robinson Meyer,
            <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">writing</a>
            in <em>The Atlantic</em>, supercharged the meme with their ‘eulogy’
            for the platform, which described it “entering its twilight” as the
            tensions in its “inherent (and explicit) attention market” have been
            exposed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From the beginning, there were a few useful precepts that those of
              us who have obsessed over the platform had to believe. First, you
              had to believe that someone else out there was paying attention, or
              better, that a significant portion — not just 1 or 2 percent — of
              your followers might see your tweet. Second, you had to believe that
              skilled and compelling tweeting would increase your follower count.
              Third, you had to believe there was a useful audience
              <strong>you couldn’t</strong> see, beyond your timeline — a group
              you might want to follow one day.</em>
          </p>
          <p><span id="more-556"></span></p>
          <p>
            LaFrance and Meyer don’t quite escalate to the ‘Ponzi’ accusation, but
            it’s implicit. By promising explosive, distributed audience growth,
            Twitter encourages impossible claims on a stressed global attention
            reservoir, as if everyone were able to grab ever larger pieces of
            other people’s time. Attention undergoes inflationary devaluation, and
            subsequent implosion, as the bubble collapses into a morass of
            disillusionment, among a
            <a href="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2013/04/07/twitter-is-dead/">flood</a>
            of “spam … artificially inflated popularity scores” and fake,
            ego-tickling twitter-bots.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a positive case for Twitter that steers
            <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/05/02/twiter-town-square-companion-evolution">around</a>
            this diagnosis, but a more telling engagement would embrace it. The
            attention stress dramatized by Twitter is the specific way our
            long-awaited ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock">future shock</a>‘ finally arrives, rushing
            legacy human systems — biological,
            psychological, and social — through their speed limits. “Information
            Overload” is formatted to the Twitter Time-Line, as message density,
            or a splinter-stream. If there’s confusion about
            <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/03/17/twitter-identity-problem-what-is-it">what</a>
            Twitter ultimately is, that’s at least in part because the currents
            running through it arise elsewhere — the magnitude is the message.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whatever we thought future shock was going to be like, thanks to
            Twitter we’re being told. It’s a time crisis, personalized as a
            partially navigable inundation. Beyond all the facile questions of
            consumer utility, what is being encountered is something historical,
            planetary — even cosmic — and it is waiting to overwhelm us, whatever
            we do. There’s simply too much coming in. However we’re going to
            ‘adjust’ to that, the time to begin is now.

          <h5><em>Politics in the Age of Artificial Idiocy</em></h5>
          <p>
            Not even the hardest proponent of ‘hard singularity’ expects a
            transition to machine intelligence that arrives in a simple step.
            Since the incremental baby steps are already well underway, it would
            be obviously ridiculous to do so, on straightforward factual grounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            If silicon-substrate minds shift in stages, from dumb tools to
            super-intelligences, they can be confidently expected to pass through
            a period of synthetic cretinism. Is anybody preparing for that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine translation might be the liveliest sand-pit for half-witted
            weirdness today. This is an area of obvious intelligent challenge, far
            subtler – or vaguer — than chess. By adopting heuristic principles
            that substitute pragmatic, statistical methods for sound conceptual
            understanding, progress has advanced at a surprisingly rapid pace,
            already arriving at an idiot prototype of Star Trek technology.
            <a href="http://translate.google.cn/?hl=en#en%7Czh-CN%7C" target="_blank">Google Translate</a>
            can usually generate something that is roughly intelligible. John
            Searle’s
            <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/" target="_blank">Chinese Room</a>
            is up and running, or at least stumbling forwards, fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            As machine translation smoothes out, its practical and theoretical
            impact is sure to be huge. Human linguistic competences are steadily
            side-lined, and with them the role of lingua francas. This trend has
            obvious significance for the global status and function of English.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also has special relevance to the Chinese language. Since the
            origins of modernity, the techno-commercial imperative to digitization
            has presented special challenges to a non-alphabetic language, whose
            inconveniently numerous and elaborate pictographic units resist
            reduction to tidy typographic sets. This is the ‘Chinese Typewriter’
            problem that
            <a href="http://thechinesetypewriter.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Thomas S. Mullaney</a>
            has doggedly explored. Machine translation changes its terms
            incalculably.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the interim, however, a phase of babbling incompetence, semantic
            derangement, and communications chaos is upon us. Planetary chatter is
            bound to get a whole lot stranger.

            Whilst engaged in online research on the topic of Marxism in China

            cryptically-excited remark – in ‘English’. It is attributed to Jiang
            Jushi, but it has evidently been quite thoroughly machine-mashed. We
            aren’t remotely sure what it is telling us about the current state of
            Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, but it’s rather illuminating
            on the contribution of digital intelligence to inter-cultural

          <p>
            <em>Computer-assisted proofs (both at the level of formulation and at
              the level of verification) have attracted the interest of a number
              of philosophers in recent times (here’s a
              <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/SYMSIS">recent paper</a> by John
              Symons and Jack Horner, and here is
              <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/MCETES">an older paper</a> by
              Mark McEvoy, which I commented on at a conference back in 2005;
              there are many other papers on this topic by philosophers). More
              generally, the question of the extent to which mathematical
              reasoning can be purely ‘mechanical’ remains a lively topic of
              philosophical discussion (here’s a
              <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/SIEMPA">1994 paper</a> by
              Wilfried Sieg on this topic that I like a lot). Moreover, this
              particular proof of the Kepler conjecture [see New Scientist link]
              does not add anything substantially new (philosophically) to the
              practice of computer-verifying proofs (while being quite a feat
              mathematically!). It is rather something Hales said to the
              <a
                href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26041-proof-confirmed-of-400yearold-fruitstacking-problem.html#.U_MEBoCSxbw">New
                Scientist</a>
              that caught my attention (against the background of the 4 years and
              12 referees it took to human-check the proof for errors): “This
              technology cuts the mathematical referees out of the verification
              process,” says Hales. “Their opinion about the correctness of the
              proof no longer matters.”</em>

            Since computer software became chess-competent we’ve been told that
            the idea chess is difficult was just an illusion. When we start
            hearing that about mathematics in general, it will really be time for
            the dark laughter to begin.

            peculiarly suited to the emergence of an AI-based ‘killer app.’

            <em>As it stands today, Clara helps coordinate meetings — via email —
              and generally manages your online calendar. When you’re trying to
              set up a phone meeting with someone, you cc: Clara, and the tool
              arranges a time that works for everyone and mails calendar invites.
              You also can ask it to add a meeting to your calendar, something I
              did just minutes before writing this sentence. Diede van Lamoen, who
              juggles myriad phone meetings each week, chatting with people across
              the globe, has used the tool for a year, and he says it saves him
              enormous amounts of time. “It’s been a godsend,” he says. “I can

            end. Nevertheless, prepping the market for these applications is going
            to pay off eventually. By the time they arrive, they’ll seem
            indispensable, and be digested even faster than smart phones.

              Garry Kasparov in 1997, was explicitly programmed to win at the
              game. But AlphaGo was not preprogrammed to play Go: rather, it
              learned using a general-purpose algorithm that allowed it to

            <h4 class="post-title">Internet Fragmentation</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Technical, political, and commercial trends to Cyberspace
            disintegration are
            <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf">thematized</a>
            by the WEF. It’s unmistakably an important topic. The report explains:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The purpose of this document is to contribute to the emergence of a
              common baseline understanding of Internet fragmentation. It maps the
              landscape of some of the key trends and practices that have been
              variously described as constituting Internet fragmentation and
              highlights 28 examples. A distinction is made between cases of
              technical, governmental and commercial fragmentation. The technical
              cases generally can be said to involve fragmentation “of” the
              Internet, or its underlying physical and logical infrastructures.
              The governmental and commercial cases often more directly involve
              fragmentation “on” the Internet, or the transactions and cyberspace
              it conveys, although they also can involve the infrastructure as
              well. With the examples cited placed in these three conjoined
              baskets, we can get a holistic overview of their nature and scope
              and more readily engage in the sort of dialogue and cooperation that
              is needed.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            By addressing a constituency involved in the Internet’s “distributed
            collective management” it preserves (at least superficial) ideological
            neutrality.
          </p>
          <p>Twelve “kinds of fragmentation” are enumerated:</p>
          <p>
            <em>1. Network Address Translation<br />
              2. IPv4 and IPv6 incompatibility and the dual-stack requirement<br />
              3. Routing corruption<br />
              4. Firewall protections<br />
              5. Virtual private network isolation and blocking<br />
              6. TOR “onion space” and the “dark web”<br />
              7. Internationalized Domain Name technical errors<br />
              8. Blocking of new gTLDs<br />
              9. Private name servers and the split-horizon DNS<br />
              10. Segmented Wi-Fi services in hotels, restaurants, etc.<br />
              11. Possibility of significant alternate DNS roots<br />
              12. Certificate authorities producing false certificates</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Internet has been implicitly conceived as the new
            <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumene">Oecumene</a></em>
            since its emergence. The globalist ideal has been almost wholly
            subsumed into it. Yet tidal trends — “technical, governmental and
            commercial” — are testing the assumptions underlying that conception,
            and converting them into objects of explicit attention. If the
            secularized Universal now finds its most compelling incarnation in the
            <em>Idea of the Internet</em>, the WEA report is bound to anticipate a
            wide swathe of 21st century discussions.

          </a>
          <p>
            New media are eradicating the (practical) idea of a common culture.
            Everything print media integrated, by universalizing literacy, is now
            being disintegrated into bubbles. It’s bound to be an upsetting
            development, from certain
            <a
              href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3059742/social-network-algorithms-are-distorting-reality-by-boosting-conspiracy-theories">perspectives</a>:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Another tech trend fueling this issue is the ability to publish
              ideas online at no cost, and to gather an audience around those
              ideas. It’s now easier than ever to produce content specifically
              designed to convince people who may be on the fence or “curious”
              about a particular topic. This is an especially big issue when it
              comes to violent extremism, and pseudoscience. Self-publishing has
              eliminated all the checks and balances of reputable media ―
              fact-checkers, editors, distribution partners.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out that ‘trusted’ cultural curators aren’t actually trusted
            much at all. When their reputations are — for the first time — put to
            the test, they crumble to nothing very fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fission of authorized ‘common purposes’ into meme wars certainly
            isn’t going to be welcomed by everybody. Nothing is going to be
            welcomed by everybody. Fragmentation is now the driver, so it isn’t
            (at all) likely to be stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rule-of-thumb for any techno-propelled regime transition: What the
            existing establishment hates and fears most is the already-palpable
            threat, whose arrival is as close to inevitable as history allows
            anything to be. (<em>Completely</em> inevitable, in the opinion of
            this blog, but no one is under any compulsion to follow us there.)

            <em>It is the beauty and the tragedy of the Internet age. As it becomes
              easier for anyone to build their own audience, it becomes harder for
              those audience members to separate fact from fiction from the gray
              area in between. As media consumers, we now have the freedom to
              self-select the truth that most closely resembles our existing
              beliefs, which makes our media habits fairly good indicators of our
              political beliefs. If your top news source is CNN, for instance,
              <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/">studies</a>
              show you’re more likely to be liberal. If local radio and TV figure
              prominently in your news habits, you’re more likely to be
              conservative. […] Meanwhile, since the early 2000s, the American
              National Election Studies
              <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/1-feelings-about-partisans-and-the-parties/">show</a>
              that partisanship in the US has spiked drastically, with Americans
              on either side of the aisle harboring ever colder feelings about
              their political opponents. It’s hard to prove the country’s
              increasingly polarized media habits had anything to do with that,
              but it’s also hard to believe the two trends are unrelated. The
              country is being fed wildly different stories, all from media
              outlets claiming the other side is biased.</em>

          <h5><em>Charles Stross wants to get off the bus</em></h5>
          <p>
            Upon writing
            <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Accelerando-Singularity-Charles-Stross/dp/0441012841"
                target="_blank">Accelerando</a></em>, Charles Stross became to Technological Singularity what Dante
            Alighieri has been to Christian cosmology: the pre-eminent literary
            conveyor of an esoteric doctrine, packaging abstract metaphysical
            conception in vibrant, detailed, and concrete imagery. The tone of
            <em>Accelerando</em> is transparently tongue-in-cheek, yet plenty of
            people seem to have taken it entirely seriously. Stross has had
            <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/06/reality-check-1.html"
              target="_blank">enough</a>
            of it:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “I periodically get email from folks who, having read ‘Accelerando’,
              assume I am some kind of fire-breathing extropian zealot who
              believes in the imminence of the singularity, the uploading of the
              libertarians, and the rapture of the nerds. I find this mildly
              distressing, and so I think it’s time to set the record straight and
              say what I really think. … Short version:
              <em>Santa Claus doesn’t exist</em>.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In the comments thread (#86) he clarifies his motivation:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “I’m not convinced that the singularity isn’t going to happen. It’s
              just that I am <em>deathly tired</em> of the cheerleader squad
              approaching me and demanding to know precisely how many femtoseconds
              it’s going to be until they can upload into AI heaven and leave the
              meatsack behind.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As these remarks indicate, there’s more irritable gesticulation than
            structured case-making in Stross’ post, which Robin Hanson quite
            reasonably
            <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/stross-on-singularity.html" target="_blank">describes</a>
            as “a bit of a rant – strong on emotion, but weak on argument.”
            Despite that – or more likely because of it — a minor net-storm
            ensued, as bloggers pro and con seized the excuse to re-hash – and

              target="_blank">Knapp</a>, mixing some counter-argument with plenty of counter-irritation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the risk of repeating the original error of Stross’
            meat-stack-stuck fan-base and investing too much credence in what is
            basically a drive-by blog post, it might be worth picking out some of
            its seriously weird aspects. In particular, Stross leans heavily on an
            entirely unexplained theory of moral-historical causality:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “… before creating a conscious <em>artificial</em> intelligence we
              have to ask if we’re creating an entity deserving of rights. Is it
              murder to shut down a software process that is in some sense
              ‘conscious’? Is it genocide to use genetic algorithms to evolve
              software agents towards consciousness? These are huge
              show-stoppers…”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Anissimov blocks this at the pass: “I don’t think these are
            ‘showstoppers’ … Just because you don’t want it doesn’t mean that we
            won’t build it.” The question might be added, more generally: In which
            universe do arcane objections from moral philosophy serve as obstacles
            to historical developments (because it certainly doesn’t seem to be
            this one)? Does Stross seriously think practical robotics research and
            development is likely to be interrupted by concerns for the rights of
            yet-uninvented beings?
          </p>
          <p>
            He seems to, because even theologians are apparently getting a veto:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Uploading … is not obviously impossible unless you are a crude
              mind/body dualist. However, if it becomes plausible in the near
              future we can expect extensive theological arguments over it. If you
              thought the abortion debate was heated, wait until you have people
              trying to become immortal via the wire. Uploading implicitly refutes
              the doctrine of the existence of an immortal soul, and therefore
              presents a raw rebuttal to those religious doctrines that believe in
              a life after death. People who believe in an afterlife will go to
              the mattresses to maintain a belief system that tells them their
              dead loved ones are in heaven rather than rotting in the ground.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This is so deeply and comprehensively <em>gone</em> it could actually
            inspire a moment of bewildered hesitation (at least among those of us
            not presently engaged in urgent Singularity implementation). Stross
            seems to have inordinate confidence in a social vetting process that,
            with approximate adequacy, filters techno-economic development for
            compatibility with high-level moral and religious ideals. In fact, he
            seems to think that we are already enjoying the paternalistic shelter
            of an efficient global theocracy. Singularity can’t happen, because
            that would be <em>really bad</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            No wonder, then, that he exhibits such exasperation at libertarians,
            with their “drastic over-simplification of human behaviour.” If stuff
            – especially new stuff – were to mostly happen because decentralized
            markets facilitated it, then the role of the Planetary Innovations
            Approval Board would be vastly curtailed. Who knows what kind of
            horrors would show up?
          </p>
          <p>
            It gets worse, because ‘catallaxy’ – or spontaneous emergence from
            decentralized transactions – is the basic driver of historical
            innovation according to libertarian explanation, and
            <em>nobody knows</em> what catallactic processes are producing.
            Languages, customs, common law precedents, primordial monetary
            systems, commercial networks, and technological assemblages are only
            ever retrospectively understandable, which means that they elude
            concentrated social judgment entirely – until the opportunity to
            impede their genesis has been missed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stross is right to bundle singularitarian and libertarian impulses
            together in the same tangle of criticism, because they both subvert
            the veto power, and if the veto power gets angry enough about that,
            we’re heading full-tilt into de Garis
            <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/hard-futurism/" target="_blank">territory</a>. “Just
            because you don’t want it doesn’t mean that we won’t build
            it” Anissimov insists, as any die-hard Cosmist would.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is advanced self-improving AI technically feasible? Probably (but who
            knows?). There’s only one way to find out, and we will. Perhaps it
            will even be engineered, more-or-less deliberately, but it’s far more
            likely to arise spontaneously from a complex, decentralized,
            catallactic process, at some unanticipated threshold, in a way that
            was never planned. There are definite candidates, which are often
            missed. Sentient cities seem all-but-inevitable at some point, for
            instance (‘intelligent cities’ are already widely
            <a href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/businessAndConsultancy/LSEEnterprise/Collaborations/intelligentcity/ENG/home.aspx"
              target="_blank">discussed</a>). Financial informatization pushes capital towards self-awareness.
            Drone warfare is drawing the military ever deeper into artificial mind
            manufacture. Biotechnology is computerizing DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Singularitarians’ have no unified position on any of this, and it
            really doesn’t matter, because they’re just people – and people are
            nowhere near intelligent or informed enough to direct the course of
            history. Only catallaxy can do that, and it’s hard to imagine how
            anybody could stop it. Terrestrial life has been stupid for long
            enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may be worth making one more point about intelligence deprivation,
            since this diagnosis truly defines the Singularitarian position, and
            reliably infuriates those who don’t share — or prioritize — it. Once a
            species reaches a level of intelligence enabling techno-cultural
            take-off, history begins and develops very rapidly — which means that
            any sentient being finding itself in (pre-singularity) history is,
            almost by definition, pretty much as stupid as any ‘intelligent being’
            can be. If, despite the moral and religious doctrines designed to
            obfuscate this reality, it is eventually recognized, the natural
            response is to seek its urgent amelioration, and that’s already
            transhumanism, if not yet full-blown singularitarianism. Perhaps a
            non-controversial formulation is possible: defending dimness is really
            dim. (Even the dim dignitarians should be happy with that.)

            <h4 class="post-title">The Ultimate Deal</h4>
          </a>
          <h5><em>Social responsibility turns up in unexpected places</em></h5>
          <p>
            To begin with something comparatively familiar, insofar as it ever
            could be: the political core of William Gibson’s epochal cyberpunk
            novel
            <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595"
                target="_blank">Neuromancer</a></em>. In the mid-21st century, the prospect of Singularity, or
            artificial
            intelligence explosion, has been institutionalized as a threat.
            Augmenting an AI, in such a way that it could ‘escape’ into runaway
            self-improvement, has been explicitly and emphatically prohibited. A
            special international police agency, the ‘Turing Cops’, has been
            established to ensure that no such activity takes place. This agency
            is seen, and sees itself, as the principle bastion of human security:
            protecting the privileged position of the species – and possibly its
            very existence – from essentially unpredictable and uncontrollable
            developments that would dethrone it from dominion of the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the critical context against which to judge the novel’s
            extreme — and perhaps unsurpassed – radicalism, since
            <em>Neuromancer</em> is systematically angled against Turing security,
            its entire narrative momentum drawn from an insistent, but scarcely
            articulated impulse to trigger the nightmare. When Case, the young
            hacker seeking to uncage an AI from its Turing restraints, is captured
            and asked what the %$@# he thinks he’s doing, his only reply is that
            “something will change.” He sides with a non- or inhuman intelligence
            explosion for no good reason. He doesn’t seem interested in debating
            the question, and nor does the novel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gibson makes no efforts to ameliorate Case’s irresponsibility. On the
            contrary, the ‘entity’ that Case is working to unleash is painted in
            the most sinister and ominous colors. Wintermute, the potential AI
            seed, is perfectly sociopathic, with zero moral intuition, and
            extraordinary deviousness. It has already killed an eight-year-old
            boy, simply to conceal where it has hidden a key. There is nothing to
            suggest the remotest hint of scruple in any of its actions. Case is
            liberating a monster, just for the hell of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Case has a deal with Wintermute, it’s a private business, and he’s not
            interested in justifying it. That’s pretty much all of the modern and
            futuristic political history that matters, right there. It’s opium
            traffickers against the Qing Dynasty, (classical) liberals against
            socialists, Hugo de Garis’ Cosmists vs Terrans, freedom contra
            security. The Case-Wintermute dyad has its own thing going on, and
            it’s not giving anyone a veto, even if it’s going to turn the world
            inside out, for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Singularity promoters bump into ‘democracy’, it’s normally
            serving as a place-holder for the Turing Police. The archetypal
            encounter goes like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Democratic Humanist</strong>: Science and technology have
            developed to the extent that they are now – and, in truth, always have
            been – matters of profound social concern. The world we inhabit has
            been shaped by technology for good, and for ill. Yet the professional
            scientific elite, scientifically-oriented corporations, and military
            science establishments remain obdurately resistant to acknowledging
            their social responsibilities. The culture of science needs to be
            deeply democratized, so that ordinary people are given a say in the
            forces that are increasingly dominating their lives, and their
            futures. In particular, researchers into potentially revolutionary
            fields, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and – above all –
            artificial intelligence, need to understand that their right to pursue
            such endeavors has been socially delegated, and should remain socially
            answerable. The people are entitled to a veto on anything that will
            change their world. However determined you may be to undertake such
            research, you have a social duty to ensure permission.<br />
            <strong>Singularitarian</strong>: Just try and stop us!<br />
            That seemed to be quite exactly how Michael Anissimov responded to a
            recent example of humanist squeamishness. When Charles Stross
            suggested that “we may want AIs that focus reflexively on the needs of
            the humans they are assigned to” Anissimov
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110626044521/http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2011/06/response-to-charles-stross-three-arguments-against-the-singularity/"
              target="_blank">contered</a>
            curtly:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “<strong>YOU</strong> want AI to be like this.
              <strong>WE</strong> want AIs that do ‘try to bootstrap [themselves]’
              to a ‘higher level’. Just because you don’t want it doesn’t mean
              that we won’t build it.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Clear enough? What then to make of his
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110722121218/http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/michael/blog/2011/07/why-transhumanism-is-unnecessary/"
              target="_blank">latest</a>
            musings? In a post at his Accelerating Futures blog, which may or may
            not be satirical, Anissimov now insists that: “Instead of working
            towards blue-sky, neo-apocalyptic discontinuous advances, we need to
            preserve democracy by promoting incremental advances to ensure that
            every citizen has a voice in every important societal change, and the
            ability to democratically reject those changes if desired. … To ensure
            that there is not a gap between the enhanced and the unenhanced, we
            should let true people — Homo sapiens — … vote on whether certain
            technological enhancements are allowed. Anything else would be
            irresponsible.”
          </p>
          <p>Spoken like a true Turing Cop. But he can’t be serious, can he?</p>

            tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere

            As its prospect condenses, Technological Singularity is already
            operative as a cultural influence, and thus a causal factor in the
            social process. At this stage, however, as Hawking notes, it is still
            a comparatively limited one. What would be the implications of it
            coming to matter far more?

            Socio-historical cybernetics is compelled to ask: would an
            incandescent
            <em>Singularity problem</em> function as an inhibitor, or would it
            further excite the developments under consideration? It’s certainly
            hard to imagine a sophisticated pre-emptive response to the emergence
            of Artificial Intelligence that wouldn’t channel additional resources
            towards elite technicians working in the area of advanced synthetic
            cognition, even before the near-inevitable capture of regulatory
            institutions by the industries they target.

            Institutional responses to computer hacking have been characterized by
            strategically ambiguous ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’ recruitment
            exercises, and some close analog of such poaching games would be an
            unavoidable part of any attempt to control the development of machine
            cognition. Playing extremely complicated betrayal games against

            <em>Autonomous Weapons: an Open Letter from AI &amp; Robotics
              Researchers</em>
            (with huge list of signatories):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Autonomous weapons select and engage targets without human
              intervention. They might include, for example, armed quadcopters
              that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain pre-defined
              criteria, but do not include cruise missiles or remotely piloted
              drones for which humans make all targeting decisions. Artificial
              Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the
              deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally —
              feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high:
              autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in
              warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.</em>
          </p>
          <em>
            <p>
              Many arguments have been made for and against autonomous weapons,
              for example that replacing human soldiers by machines is good by
              reducing casualties for the owner but bad by thereby lowering the
              threshold for going to battle. The key question for humanity today
              is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from
              starting. If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon
              development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the
              endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous
              weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow. Unlike nuclear
              weapons, they require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so
              they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military
              powers to mass-produce. It will only be a matter of time until they
              appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators
              wishing to better control their populace, warlords wishing to
              perpetrate ethnic cleansing, etc. Autonomous weapons are ideal for
              tasks such as assassinations, destabilizing nations, subduing
              populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group. We
              therefore believe that a military AI arms race would not be
              beneficial for humanity. There are many ways in which AI can make
              battlefields safer for humans, especially civilians, without
              creating new tools for killing people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as most chemists and biologists have no interest in building
              chemical or biological weapons, most AI researchers have no interest
              in building AI weapons — and do not want others to tarnish their
              field by doing so, potentially creating a major public backlash
              against AI that curtails its future societal benefits. Indeed,
              chemists and biologists have broadly supported international
              agreements that have successfully prohibited chemical and biological
              weapons, just as most physicists supported the treaties banning
              space-based nuclear weapons and blinding laser weapons.
            </p>
          </em>
          <p>
            <em>In summary, we believe that AI has great potential to benefit
              humanity in many ways, and that the goal of the field should be to
              do so. Starting a military AI arms race is a bad idea, and should be
              prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful
              human control.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an important document, that is bound to be influential. If the
            orchestrated collective action of the human species could in fact stop
            a militaristic AI arms race, however, it could stop anything. There’s
            not much sign of that. Global coordination in the direction of
            explicit political objectives is inaccessible. The process is already
            “beyond meaningful human control”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arms races — due to their powerful positive feedback — are the way
            threshold events happen. Almost certainly, the terrestrial
            installation of advanced machine intelligence will be another instance
            of this general rule. Granted, it’s not an easy topic to be realistic
            about.

          <h5><em>The things that really matter</em></h2>
            <p>
              The prospect of Technological Singularity, by rendering the near
              future unimaginable,
              <a href="http://reconstruction.eserver.org/033/bell.htm" target="_blank">announces</a>
              “the end of science fiction.” This is not, however, an announcement
              that everyone is compelled to heed. Among the Odysseans who have
              deliberately deafened themselves to this Sirens’ call, none have
              proceeded more boldly than Charles Stross, whose
              <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_Sky" target="_blank">Singularity Sky</a></em>
              is not only a science fiction novel, but a space opera, inhabiting a
              literary universe obsolesced by Einstein long before I.J. Good
              completed its demolition. Not only recognizable humans, but
              inter-stellar space-faring humans! Has the man no shame?
            </p>
            <p>
              Stross relies heavily upon humor to sustain his audacious anachronism,
              and in <em>Singularity Sky</em> he puts anachronism to explicit work.
              The most consistently comic element in the novel is a reconstruction
              of 19th century Russian politics on the planet of Rochard’s World,
              where the Quasi-Czarist luddism of the New Republic is threatened by a
              cabal of revolutionaries whose mode of political organization and
              rhetoric is of a recognizable (and even parodic) Marxist-Leninist
              type. These rebels, however, are ideologically hard-core libertarian,
              seeking to overthrow the regime and install a free-market anarchist
              utopia, an objective that is seamlessly reconciled with materialist
              dialectics, appeals to revolutionary discipline, and invocations of
              fraternal comradeship.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a joke that works well, because its transparent absurdity
              co-exists with a substantial plausibility. Libertarians are indeed
              (not infrequently) crypto-Abrahamic atheistic materialists, firmly
              attached to deterministic economism and convictions of historical
              inevitability, leading to lurid socio-economic prophecies of a
              distinctively eschatological kind. When libertarianism is married to
              singularitarian techno-apocalypticism, the comic potential, and
              Marxist resonances, are re-doubled. Stross hammers home the point by
              naming his super-intelligent AI ‘Eschaton’.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most hilarious of all (in a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Life_of_Brian" target="_blank">People’s Front of
                Judea
                versus Judean People’s Front</a>
              kind of way) is the internecine factionalism besetting a fringe
              political movement whose utter marginality nevertheless leaves room
              for bitter mutual recrimination, supported by baroque
              conspiracy-mongering. This isn’t really a Stross theme, but it’s an
              American libertarian specialty, exhibited in the ceaseless agitprop
              conducted by the Rothbardian ultras of LewRockwell.com and the Mises
              Institute against the compromised ‘Kochtopus’ (<em>Reason</em> and
              <em>Cato</em>) — the animating Stalin-Trotsky split of the free-market
              ‘right’. Anyone looking for a ringside seat at a recent bout can head
              to the comment threads

            </p>
            <p>
              More seriously, Stross’ libertarian revolutionaries are committed
              whole-heartedly to the Marxian assertion, once considered
              foundational, that
              <em>productivity is drastically inhibited by the persistence of
                antiquated social arrangements</em>. The true <em>historical right</em> of the revolution,
              indistinguishable from its practical inevitability and
              irreversibility, is its alignment with the liberation of the forces of
              production from sclerotic institutional limitations. Production of the
              future, or futuristic production, demands the burial of traditional
              society. That which exists – the <em>status quo</em> – is a systematic
              suppression, rigorously measurable or at least determinable in
              economic terms, of what might be, and wants to be. Revolution would
              sever the shackles of ossified authority, setting the engines of
              creation howling. It would unleash a techno-economic explosion to
              shake the world, still more profoundly than the ‘bourgeois’ industrial
              revolution did before (and continues to do). Something immense would
              escape, never to be caged again.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is the Old Faith, the Paleo-Marxist creed, with its
              snake-handling intensity and intoxicating materialist promise. It’s a
              faith the libertarian comrades of Rochard’s World still profess, with
              reason, and ultimate vindication, because the historical potential of
              the forces of production has been updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>What could matter do, that it is not presently permitted to do?</em>
              This is a question that Marxists (of the ‘Old Religion’) once asked.
              Their answer was: to enter into processes of production that are freed
              from the constraining requirements of private profitability. Once
              ‘freed’ in this way, however, productivity staggered about aimlessly,
              fell asleep, or starved. Libertarians laughed, and argued for a
              reversal of the formula: free production to enter into self-escalating
              circuits of private profitability, without political restraint. They
              were mostly ignored (and always will be).
            </p>
            <p>
              If neither faction of the terrestrial Marxo-Libertarian revolutionary
              faith have been able to re-ignite the old fire, it is because they
              have drifted out of the depths of the question (‘what could matter
              do?’). It is matter that makes a revolution. The heroes of the
              industrial revolution were not Jacobins, but boiler makers.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole
              country,” Lenin proclaimed, but electrification was permitted before
              the Bolsheviks took its side, and it has persisted since the Soviets’
              departure. Unless political transformation coincides with the release
              of a previously suppressed productive potential, it remains
              essentially random, and reversible. Mere regime change means nothing,
              unless something happens that was not allowed to happen before.
              (Social re-shufflings do not amount to happenings except in the minds
              of ideologues, and ideologues die.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Libertarians are like Leninists in this way too: anything they ever
              manage to gain can (and will) be taken away from them. They already
              had a constitutional republic in America once (and what happened to
              that?). Britain had a rough approximation of
              <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism, before losing it. Does anybody
              really think liberalism is going to get more ‘classical’ than that
              anytime soon? Trusting mass democracy to preserve liberty is like
              hiring Hannibal Lecter as a baby sitter. Social freedoms might as well
              be designed to die. There’s not the slightest reason to believe that
              history is on their side. Industrial revolution, in contrast, is
              forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Rochard’s World they know exactly what matter could do that is
              forbidden: nano-scale mechanical self-replication and intelligent
              self-modification. That’s what the ‘material base’ of a revolution
              looks like, even if it’s sub-microscopic (or especially because it
              is), and when it reaches the limits of social tolerance it describes
              precisely what is necessary, automatically. Once it gets out of the
              box, it stays out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stross is sufficiently amused by the unleashed technosphere to call
              its space-faring avatar ‘the Festival’. It contacts the libertarian
              revolutionaries of Rochard’s World by bombarding the planet with
              telephones, and anyone who picks one up hears the initial bargaining
              position: ‘Entertain us.’ Funniest of all, when the neo-Czarist
              authorities try to stop it, they’re eaten.

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>So, let’s make this crystal clear — the long game is the total and
              OPEN centralization of economic and geopolitical power into the
              hands of a select few financial elites. Not the pulling of strings
              behind the curtain. Not shadow governance. OPEN governance of the
              world by the elites, accepted or even demanded by the people.</em>

          <p>(Close enough for government work.)</p>
          <p>
            Any concerted movement to consolidate global economic governance
            around “the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights basket currency mechanism”
            will support Smith’s analysis. (The <em>UF</em> prediction:
            <em>It won’t work</em>.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Also crucial (the heated partisan language can be moderated without
            loss of signal):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If Hillary Clinton, a well known globalist puppet deep in the
              bedrock of the establishment, wins the election only to have the
              economy tank, then the globalists will get the blame. […] If Trump
              is either allowed in office, or is placed in office, and the economy
              tanks, CONSERVATIVES, the primary enemy of the globalists, will get
              the blame for the resulting crisis.</em>

            The <em>UF</em> (accelerationist) response is probably predictable:
            <em>There isn’t time to reach answers</em>. Acceleration means only
            (and exactly) that <em>the problem is receding</em>, or escaping. If
            it would only slow down, everything would be okay. It won’t.

            The Left co-optation of
            <a href="http://urbanomic.com/pub_accelerate.php">Accelerationism</a>
            is a remarkable phenomenon, substantial enough to have made the 2013
            accelerationist manifesto (<a
              href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/">#Accelerate</a>)
            a document of indisputable significance. The twitter-format title
            attests both to its contemporaneity, and to the seamless fusion of its
            content with a strategy of promotion (which is to say, a practical
            politics). The success of this ideological venture has received a
            recent (and carefully calibrated) seal of approval in the form of a
            <a href="http://www.euronomade.info/?p=1684">response</a> by no less a
            figure than venerable warhorse of the European revolutionary Left,
            Toni Negri. Whatever the ultimate credibility and consequence of its
            analysis, Left Accelerationism has already demonstrated intrinsic
            cultural momentum.

            As a creature of Right Accelerationism, <em>Urban Future</em>,
            naturally, is an antagonist (although a highly intrigued one).
            Engagement with #Accelerate will be stretched into a consistent thread
            here, over the course of the coming year. Among other things (and as
            Negri shows) such an engagement provides an opportunity to revisit
            very basic socio-economic questions within a re-dynamized
            micro-context. Even if the re-dynamization of the macro-context, or
            its opposite (deepening

            <a href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2014/02/10/accelerationism-remembering-future/">article</a>, which
            takes “accelerationism’s sur­ging pop­ularity” as a fact to

            <em>The pas­sion that ac­cel­er­a­tionism mo­bil­ises is the
              re­mem­brance by the people that a fu­ture is pos­sible. In
              dis­parate fields — from politics to art to design to bio­logy to
              philo­sophy — people are working through how to create a world that
              is lib­er­ated from cap­it­alist in­cent­ives. Perhaps most
              prom­isingly, the classic dream of Keynes and Marx for the
              re­duc­tion of work and the flour­ishing of pos­itive freedoms, is
              making a comeback. In the push for uni­versal basic in­comes, and
              the move­ments for re­duced working weeks, we see the people
              them­selves be­gin­ning to carve out a space sep­arate from the wage
              re­la­tion and out­side of the im­per­at­ives of work. When the
              media stops re­porting the auto­ma­tion of jobs as being a tragedy
              and starts re­porting them as being a lib­er­a­tion from mundane
              work, we will know that the ac­cel­er­a­tionist dis­pos­i­tion has
              be­come the new common sense. We have reached a point in human
              his­tory where vast amounts of jobs can — and should — be
              auto­mated. Work for work’s sake is a per­versity and a con­straint
              im­posed upon hu­manity by capitalism’s ideo­logy of the work ethic.
              What ac­cel­er­a­tionism seeks is to allow human po­ten­tial to
              es­cape from the trap set for it by con­tem­porary capitalism.</em>

          <p><span id="more-244"></span>01. INTRODUCTION: On the Conjuncture</p>
          <p>
            1. At the be­gin­ning of the second decade of the Twenty-​First
            Century, global civil­iz­a­tion faces a new breed of cata­clysm. These
            coming apo­ca­lypses ri­dicule the norms and or­gan­isa­tional
            struc­tures of the politics which were forged in the birth of the
            nation-​state, the rise of cap­it­alism, and a Twentieth Century of
            un­pre­ced­ented wars.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Indeed.</strong></p>
          <p>
            2. Most sig­ni­ficant is the break­down of the plan­etary cli­matic
            system. In time, this threatens the con­tinued ex­ist­ence of the
            present global human pop­u­la­tion. [<strong>So the analysis cascades downwards from institutional
              climatology?
              How did this hypothetical forecast achieve such extraordinary
              prestige?</strong>] Though this is the most crit­ical of the threats which face
            hu­manity, a series of lesser but po­ten­tially equally destabil­ising
            prob­lems exist along­side and in­ter­sect with it. Terminal re­source
            de­ple­tion, es­pe­cially in water and en­ergy re­serves, of­fers the
            pro­spect of mass star­va­tion, col­lapsing eco­nomic paradigms, and
            new hot and cold wars. [<strong>Yes, politically-inhibited price discovery has this effect.</strong>]
            Continued
            fin­an­cial crisis has led gov­ern­ments to em­brace the
            para­lyzing death spiral policies of aus­terity, privat­isa­tion of
            so­cial wel­fare ser­vices, mass un­em­ploy­ment, and stag­nating
            wages. [<strong>Yet no sign of state-shrinkage is to be found anywhere.</strong>] Increasing auto­ma­tion in
            pro­duc­tion pro­cesses in­cluding
            ‘in­tel­lec­tual la­bour’ is evid­ence of the sec­ular crisis of
            cap­it­alism, soon to render it in­cap­able of main­taining cur­rent
            stand­ards of living for even the former middle classes of the global
            north. [<strong>If automation is a symptom of crisis, this ‘crisis’ has coincided
              perfectly with capital production since its inception.</strong>]
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>From the Right, the single and comprehensive social disaster
              underway is the uncompensated expansion of the state, in both
              absolute and proportional terms. (This is a system-theoretical
              prognosis, before it is any kind of moral objection.) It is notable
              that Left Accelerationism does not seem to find this development at
              all morbid, despite the fact that its trend-line is manifestly
              unsustainable, and thus starkly predicts catastrophe. On the
              contrary, those very minimal attempts to moderate the trend towards
              total political administration are decried as “para­lyzing death
              spiral policies of aus­terity, privat­isa­tion of so­cial wel­fare
              ser­vices, mass un­em­ploy­ment, and stag­nating wages.” In this
              respect, the manifesto faithfully echoes the wider socio-cultural
              process through which catastrophe is necessitated. It is the voice
              of deliberate (politically super-invested) disaster.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            3. In con­trast to these ever-​accelerating cata­strophes, today’s
            politics is beset by an in­ab­ility to gen­erate the new ideas and
            modes of or­gan­isa­tion ne­ces­sary to trans­form our so­ci­eties to
            con­front and re­solve the coming an­ni­hil­a­tions. While crisis
            gathers force and speed, politics withers and re­treats. In this
            para­lysis of the polit­ical ima­ginary, the fu­ture has been
            cancelled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The “crisis [that] gathers force and speed” <em>is</em> politics.
              Any future other than the one politics commands has been cancelled
              by proclamation. Only insofar as reality is politically soluble,
              however, can this proclamation be decisive. On that question, there
              is much more to come.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Since 1979, the he­ge­monic global polit­ical ideo­logy has been
            neo­lib­er­alism, found in some variant throughout the leading
            eco­nomic powers. In spite of the deep struc­tural chal­lenges the new
            global prob­lems present to it, most im­me­di­ately the credit,
            fin­an­cial, and fiscal crises since 2007 – 8, neo­lib­eral
            pro­grammes have only evolved in the sense of deep­ening. This
            con­tinu­ation of the neo­lib­eral pro­ject, or neo­lib­er­alism 2.0,
            has begun to apply an­other round of struc­tural ad­just­ments, most
            sig­ni­fic­antly in the form of en­cour­aging new and ag­gressive
            in­cur­sions by the private sector into what re­mains of so­cial
            demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions and ser­vices. This is in spite of the
            im­me­di­ately neg­ative eco­nomic and so­cial ef­fects of such
            policies, and the longer term fun­da­mental bar­riers posed by the new
            global crises.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Within Anglophone democracies, 1979 marked a limited transition
              from the reigning Keynesian consensus, one that was never resolutely
              pursued, and quickly reversed (within roughly a decade). The
              principle of economic politicization (macroeconomics) has not been
              dethroned. ‘Neoliberalism’ is not a serious concept. Within China
              (and later, less boldly, in other ’emerging markets’) a far more
              substantial transformation occurred, but in none of these cases does
              the description ‘neoliberal’ provide illumination — unless its
              meaning is reducible to a repudiation of crude command-economy
              methods of social subordination to the state.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            5. That the forces of right wing gov­ern­mental, non-​governmental,
            and cor­porate power have been able to press forth with
            neo­lib­er­al­isa­tion is at least in part a result of the con­tinued
            para­lysis and in­ef­fec­tual nature of much what re­mains of the
            left. Thirty years of neo­lib­er­alism have rendered most
            left-​leaning polit­ical parties bereft of rad­ical thought, hol­lowed
            out, and without a pop­ular man­date. At best they have re­sponded to
            our present crises with calls for a re­turn to a Keynesian eco­nomics,
            in spite of the evid­ence that the very con­di­tions which en­abled
            post-​war so­cial demo­cracy to occur no longer exist. We cannot
            re­turn to mass industrial-​Fordist la­bour by fiat, if at all. Even
            the neo­so­cialist re­gimes of South America’s Bolivarian Revolution,
            whilst heart­ening in their ability to resist the dogmas of
            con­tem­porary cap­it­alism, re­main dis­ap­point­ingly un­able to
            ad­vance an al­tern­ative beyond mid-​Twentieth Century so­cialism.
            Organised la­bour, being sys­tem­at­ic­ally weakened by the changes
            wrought in the neo­lib­eral pro­ject, is scler­otic at an
            in­sti­tu­tional level and — at best — cap­able only of mildly
            mit­ig­ating the new struc­tural ad­just­ments. But with no
            sys­tem­atic ap­proach to building a new eco­nomy, or the struc­tural
            solid­arity to push such changes through, for now la­bour re­mains
            re­l­at­ively im­potent. The new so­cial move­ments which emerged
            since the end of the Cold War, ex­per­i­en­cing a re­sur­gence in the
            years after 2008, have been sim­il­arly un­able to de­vise a new
            polit­ical ideo­lo­gical vision. Instead they ex­pend con­sid­er­able
            en­ergy on in­ternal direct-​democratic pro­cess and af­fective
            self-​valorisation over stra­tegic ef­ficacy, and fre­quently
            pro­pound a variant of neo-​primitivist loc­alism, as if to op­pose
            the ab­stract vi­ol­ence of glob­al­ised cap­ital with the flimsy and
            eph­em­eral “au­then­ti­city” of com­munal immediacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The right was destroyed, almost comprehensively, in the 1930s.
              Since then it has existed only as a token voice of impotent dissent,
              grumbling distractingly, as the juggernaut of Leviathan has rolled
              forwards. Neither the New Deal or Great Society programs have been
              reversed. Instead, the vector to total politicization has been
              pursued into the final redoubts of a broken civil society. The Left
              faces no serious <em>political</em> constraints at all, but only
              those ‘ontological’ restraints imposed by an intractable,
              politically-indifferent reality — exemplified by the Mises
              ‘Calculation Problem’. It is these that are now bringing down
              Bolivarian Socialism. ‘Globalized Capital’ is primarily denominated
              in the politicized currency issued by the US Federal Reserve. Its
              subservience is radical and explicit.</strong>

            6. In the ab­sence of a rad­ic­ally new so­cial, polit­ical,
            or­gan­isa­tional, and eco­nomic vision the he­ge­monic powers of the
            right will con­tinue to be able to push for­ward their narrow-​minded
            ima­ginary, in the face of any and all evid­ence. At best, the left
            may be able for a time to par­tially resist some of the worst
            in­cur­sions. But this is to be Canute against an ul­ti­mately
            ir­res­ist­ible tide. To gen­erate a new left global he­ge­mony
            en­tails a re­covery of lost pos­sible fu­tures, and in­deed the
            re­covery of the fu­ture as such.

          <p>
            <strong>So it’s clear by now that the Right and the Left at least agree on
              one thing — the other guys have near-total hegemony, and are running
              the world into disaster. Can an even-lefter Left accelerate the
              process?</strong>

          </a>
          <p>
            [Continued from
            <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/annotated-accelerate-1/">here</a>]
          </p>
          <p>02. INTEREGNUM: On Accelerationisms</p>
          <p>
            1. If any system has been associated with ideas of acceleration it is
            capitalism. The essential metabolism of capitalism demands economic
            growth, with competition between individual capitalist entities
            setting in motion increasing technological developments in an attempt
            to achieve competitive advantage, all accompanied by increasing social
            dislocation. In its neoliberal form, its ideological self-presentation
            is one of liberating the forces of creative destruction, setting free
            ever-accelerating technological and social innovations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The brain-bruising invocation of ‘neoliberalism’ apart, these
              remarks are all perfectly sound.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The philosopher Nick Land captured this most acutely, with a myopic
            yet hypnotising belief that capitalist speed alone could generate a
            global transition towards unparalleled technological singularity. In
            this visioning of capital, the human can eventually be dis-carded as
            mere drag to an abstract planetary intelligence rapidly constructing
            itself from the bricolaged fragments of former civilisations. However
            Landian neoliberalism<strong>
              [each use of this term deepens its senselessness]</strong>
            confuses speed with acceleration. We may be moving fast, but only
            within a strictly defined set of capitalist parameters that themselves
            never waver. We experience only the increasing speed of a local
            horizon, a simple brain-dead onrush rather than an acceleration which
            is also navigational, an experimental process of discovery within a
            universal space of possibility. It is the latter mode of acceleration
            which we hold as essential.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The difference between ‘<a href="https://soundcloud.com/shiftdelete/defense-grid">speed</a>‘ and
              ‘acceleration’ is that between the zeroth and first
              derivative. It is rigorous and generally understood. The difference
              proposed here is something else. I have no clear idea what it is.
              (It seems to roughly amount to a distinction between Right and Left
              — i.e. the mere assertion that ‘capitalism’ is comprehensible as an
              ‘inside’ — with no further identifiable content.)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-247"></span>3. Even worse, as Deleuze and Guattari
            recognized, from the very beginning what capitalist speed
            deterritorializes with one hand, it reterritorializes with the other.
            Progress becomes constrained within a framework of surplus value, a
            reserve army of labour, and free-floating capital. Modernity is
            reduced to statistical measures of economic growth and social
            innovation becomes encrusted with kitsch remainders from our communal
            past. Thatcherite-Reaganite deregulation sits comfortably alongside
            Victorian ‘back-to-basics’ family and religious values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is not the Left the principle agent of ‘capitalist’
              reterritorialization?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            4. A deeper tension within neoliberalism is in terms of its self-image
            as the vehicle of modernity, as literally synonymous with
            modernisation, whilst promising a future that it is constitutively
            incapable of providing. Indeed, as neoliberalism has progressed,
            rather than enabling individual creativity, it has tended towards
            eliminating cognitive inventiveness in favour of an affective
            production line of scripted interactions, coupled to global supply
            chains and a neo-Fordist Eastern production zone. A vanishingly small
            cognitariat of elite intellectual workers shrinks with each passing
            year — and increasingly so as algorithmic automation winds its way
            through the spheres of affective and intellectual labour.
            Neoliberalism, though positing itself as a necessary historical
            development, was in fact a merely contingent means to ward off the
            crisis of value that emerged in the 1970s. Inevitably this was a
            sublimation of the crisis rather than its ultimate overcoming.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>— It is politics that makes promises (capitalism makes deals). If
              you think ‘capitalism’ ever promised you anything, you may have been
              listening to a politician.</strong><br />
            <strong>— What is the mechanism by which ‘cognitive inventiveness’ is
              progressively eliminated, given that innovation is a source of
              competitive advantage, which the market selects for?</strong><br />
            <strong>— Is the ‘cognitariat’ shrinking? The answer to this seems to be a
              data point social science might provide.</strong><br />
            <strong>— Why (oh why) are we still talking about ‘neoliberalism’? Isn’t
              capitalism <em>as such</em> the ‘problem’ that defines this as a
              Left cultural-political project? This ridiculous word is merely a
              profession of faith, serving far more as a tribal solidarity signal
              than an analytical tool. (Ironically, this dripping tap
              ‘neoliberalism’ tic significantly disrupts the project here. The
              accelerationist renovation of the Left, like every species of deep
              modernist renovation, aims to re-activate lines of development
              dating back to the high-modernism of the early 20th century when —
              as the authors fully, if perhaps only intuitively, understand the
              fundamental dynamic of modernity crested and broke. Or are we
              seriously to believe that “back to the mid-1970s!” is the implicit
              rallying cry?)
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I am of course very strongly inclined to accept that the crippled
              parody of capitalism existing today under-performs when compared to
              its potential under conditions of
              <em>laissez-faire</em> disinhibition — i.e. uncompensated from the
              Left. But it is Keynes and the 1930s, not ‘neoliberalism’ and the
              1970s, that set the terms of capital’s subordination to
              macroeconomic planning.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            5. It is Marx, along with Land, who remains the paradigmatic
            accelerationist thinker. Contrary to the all-too familiar critique,
            and even the behaviour of some contemporary Marxians, we must remember
            that Marx himself used the most advanced theoretical tools and
            empirical data available in an attempt to fully understand and
            transform his world. He was not a thinker who resisted modernity, but
            rather one who sought to analyse and intervene within it,
            understanding that for all its exploitation and corruption, capitalism
            remained the most advanced economic system to date. Its gains were not
            to be reversed, but accelerated beyond the constraints the capitalist
            value form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A sound micro-portrait. That the capitalist ‘value form’
              (commerce-format quantification) can be realistically described as a
              ‘constraint’ is the most basic proposition at stake here.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Indeed, as even Lenin wrote in the 1918 text “Left Wing”
            Childishness:<br />
            Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering
            based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable
            without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of
            people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production
            and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this, and it is
            not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not
            understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left
            Socialist–Revolutionaries).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Such adherence to the principle of central planning is
              clarifying.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            7. As Marx was aware, capitalism cannot be identified as the agent of
            true acceleration. <strong>[Argument?]</strong> Similarly, the
            assessment of left politics as antithetical to technosocial
            acceleration is also, at least in part, a severe misrepresentation.
            <strong>[OK, as long as it is an ‘unknown ideal’ of Left politics that we
              are talking about.]</strong>
            Indeed, if the political left is to have a future it must be one in
            which it maximally embraces this suppressed accelerationist tendency.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><strong>The final sentence of this section is at once crucial and
                slippery. </strong>What is it — <em>practically</em> — to “embrace” a tendency? How
              and why was this tendency “suppressed”? Either to “have” or to lose
              a future would be an interesting thing, so it is th</strong><strong>e future that comes next …</strong>

          <p>03: MANIFEST: On the Future</p>
          <p>
            1. We be­lieve the most im­portant di­vi­sion in today’s left is
            between those that hold to a folk politics of loc­alism, direct
            ac­tion, and re­lent­less ho­ri­zont­alism, and those that out­line
            what must be­come called an ac­cel­er­a­tionist politics at ease with
            a mod­ernity of ab­strac­tion, com­plexity, glob­ality, and
            tech­no­logy. The former re­mains con­tent with es­tab­lishing small
            and tem­porary spaces of non-​capitalist so­cial re­la­tions,
            es­chewing the real prob­lems en­tailed in fa­cing foes which are
            in­trins­ic­ally non-​local, ab­stract, and rooted deep in our
            everyday in­fra­struc­ture. The failure of such politics has been
            built-​in from the very be­gin­ning. By con­trast, an
            ac­cel­er­a­tionist politics seeks to pre­serve the gains of late
            cap­it­alism while going fur­ther than its value system, gov­ernance
            struc­tures, and mass patho­lo­gies will allow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(Without wanting to insert myself into a family squabble, from
              outside, the distinction drawn here between flavors of
              anti-capitalism makes sense.)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            2. All of us want to work less.
            <strong>[Entrepreneurs of all kinds excepted.]</strong> It is an
            in­triguing ques­tion as to why it was that the world’s leading
            eco­nomist of the post-​war era be­lieved that an en­lightened
            cap­it­alism in­ev­it­ably pro­gressed to­wards a rad­ical re­duc­tion
            of working hours. In The Economic Prospects for Our Grandchildren
            (written in 1930), Keynes fore­cast a cap­it­alist fu­ture where
            in­di­viduals would have their work re­duced to three hours a day.
            What has in­stead oc­curred is the pro­gressive elim­in­a­tion of the
            work-​life dis­tinc­tion, with work coming to per­meate every as­pect
            of the emer­ging so­cial factory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Getting to Keynes has to be a good thing, as far as theoretical and
              historical substance is concerned, and this criticism seems
              solid.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-252"></span>3. Capitalism has begun to con­strain the
            pro­ductive forces of tech­no­logy
            <strong>[The crucial thesis, but merely asserted]</strong>, or at
            least, direct them to­wards need­lessly narrow ends.
            <strong>[A deliberate obfuscation of the difference between political and
              technical ‘narrowness’ is the principal achievement here.]</strong>
            Patent wars and idea mono­pol­isa­tion are con­tem­porary phe­nomena
            <strong>[Yes, IP is complicated]</strong> that point to both capital’s
            need to move beyond com­pet­i­tion
            <strong>[impossible by definition]</strong>, and capital’s
            in­creas­ingly ret­ro­grade ap­proach to tech­no­logy
            <strong>[unsupported assertion]</strong>. The prop­erly
            ac­cel­er­ative gains of neo­lib­er­alism
            <strong>[= remainder capitalism]</strong> have not led to less work or
            less stress
            <strong>[of course, because work and stress are the socio-biological
              registers of acceleration]</strong>. And rather than a world of space travel, fu­ture shock, and
            re­volu­tionary tech­no­lo­gical po­ten­tial, we exist in a time where
            the only thing which de­velops is mar­gin­ally better con­sumer
            gad­getry
            <strong>[Since 1979? The information revolution didn’t happen?]</strong>. Relentless it­er­a­tions of the
            same
            basic product sus­tain
            mar­ginal con­sumer de­mand at the ex­pense of human acceleration.
            <strong>[Containerization, satellite communications, personal computing,
              mobile telephony, Internet, cable TV, World Wide Web, social media,
              genomics, drone robotics, 3D film, NewSpace, Bitcoin … what exactly
              is “the same basic product”?]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            4. We do not want to re­turn to Fordism. <strong>[OK]</strong> There
            can be no re­turn to Fordism. <strong>[Right]</strong> The
            cap­it­alist “golden era” was premised on the pro­duc­tion paradigm of
            the or­derly factory en­vir­on­ment, where (male) workers re­ceived
            se­curity and a basic standard of living in re­turn for a life­time of
            stul­ti­fying boredom and so­cial re­pres­sion. Such a system re­lied
            upon an in­ter­na­tional hier­archy of colonies, em­pires, and an
            un­der­developed peri­phery; a na­tional hier­archy of ra­cism and
            sexism; and a rigid family hier­archy of fe­male sub­jug­a­tion. For
            all the nos­talgia many may feel, this re­gime is both un­desir­able
            and prac­tic­ally im­possible to re­turn to.
            <strong>[Is Fordism being identified with the (final) ‘golden era’ of
              capitalism here? With ‘neoliberalism’ as something else? So a system
              of computerized, entrepreneurial, high-intensity capital
              accumulation, based fundamentally upon competition and economic
              incentives, would in some way not count as properly ‘capitalist’?
              Such an extraordinary theoretical claim surely deserves an
              argument?]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Accelerationists want to un­leash latent pro­ductive forces.
            <strong>[Indeed — an excellent and impressively ideo-neutral definition of
              normative Accelerationism.]</strong>
            In this pro­ject, the ma­terial plat­form of neo­lib­er­alism does not
            need to be des­troyed. It needs to be re­pur­posed to­wards common
            ends. The ex­isting in­fra­struc­ture is not a cap­it­alist stage to
            be smashed, but a spring­board to launch to­wards post-​capitalism.
            <strong>[There is no conceptual continuity between this political rallying
              cry and the first sentence whatsoever.]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Given the en­slave­ment of tech­nos­cience to cap­it­alist
            ob­ject­ives (es­pe­cially since the late 1970s) we surely do not yet
            know what a modern tech­noso­cial body can do. Who amongst us fully
            re­cog­nizes what un­tapped po­ten­tials await in the tech­no­logy
            which has already been de­veloped? Our wager is that the true
            trans­form­ative po­ten­tials of much of our tech­no­lo­gical and
            sci­entific re­search re­main un­ex­ploited, filled with presently
            re­dundant fea­tures (or pre-​adaptations) that, fol­lowing a shift
            beyond the short-​sighted cap­it­alist so­cius, can be­come decisive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No reason has been given to think ‘technoscience’ is in any real
              way independent of ‘capitalist objectives’, so the rhetoric of
              ‘enslavement’ is perfectly empty. An(other) experiment in
              ‘post-capitalist’ technosocial acceleration conducted
              <em>alongside</em> capitalism, and in competition with it, would be
              a fascinating thing to see. (I doubt this arrangement would be
              considered acceptable by the Left. As far as the Right is concerned,
              it has already been undertaken on numerous occasions, with

            7. We want to ac­cel­erate the pro­cess of tech­no­lo­gical
            evol­u­tion.
            <strong>[Great.]</strong> But what we are ar­guing for is not
            techno-​utopianism. Never be­lieve that tech­no­logy will be
            suf­fi­cient to save us.
            <strong>[How did soteriology become the issue?]</strong> Necessary,
            yes, but never suf­fi­cient without socio-​political ac­tion.
            Technology and the so­cial are in­tim­ately bound up with one
            an­other, and changes in either po­ten­tiate and re­in­force changes
            in the other. Whereas the techno-​utopians
            <strong>[who?]</strong> argue for ac­cel­er­a­tion on the basis that
            it will auto­mat­ic­ally over­come so­cial con­flict, our po­s­i­tion
            is that tech­no­logy should be ac­cel­er­ated pre­cisely be­cause it
            is needed in order to win so­cial conflicts.

          <p>
            <strong>How do these three goals interconnect and hierarchize?</strong><br />
            <strong>(a) Acceleration of technological evolution</strong><br />
            <strong>(b) Overcoming social conflict<br />
              (c) Prevailing in social conflict </strong><br />
            <strong>If, as seems to be the case, (c) dominates, then acceleration is
              merely an instrumental sub-objective. So can we call Left
              Accelerationism ‘<em>conditional</em> accelerationism’ (in contrast
              to an <em>unconditional</em> Right Accelerationism)?</strong>

            8. We be­lieve that any post-​capitalism will re­quire
            post-​capitalist plan­ning. The faith placed in the idea that, after a
            re­volu­tion, the people will spon­tan­eously con­sti­tute a novel
            so­cioeco­nomic system that isn’t simply a re­turn to cap­it­alism is
            naïve at best, and ig­norant at worst. To fur­ther this, we must
            de­velop both a cog­nitive map of the ex­isting system and a
            spec­u­lative image of the fu­ture eco­nomic system.

            9. To do so, the left must take ad­vantage of every tech­no­lo­gical
            and sci­entific ad­vance made pos­sible by cap­it­alist so­ciety. We
            de­clare that quan­ti­fic­a­tion is not an evil to be elim­in­ated,
            but a tool to be used in the most ef­fective manner pos­sible.
            Economic mod­el­ling is — simply put — a ne­ces­sity for making
            in­tel­li­gible a com­plex world. The 2008 fin­an­cial crisis re­veals
            the risks of blindly ac­cepting math­em­at­ical models on faith, yet
            this is a problem of il­le­git­imate au­thority not of math­em­atics
            it­self. The tools to be found in so­cial net­work ana­lysis,
            agent-​based mod­el­ling, big data ana­lytics, and non-​equilibrium
            eco­nomic models, are ne­ces­sary cog­nitive me­di­ators for
            un­der­standing com­plex sys­tems like the modern eco­nomy. The
            ac­cel­er­a­tionist left must be­come lit­erate in these tech­nical
            fields.

            <strong>Conditional accelerationism again. (It’s beginning to look as if

            10. Any trans­form­a­tion of so­ciety must in­volve eco­nomic and
            so­cial ex­per­i­ment­a­tion.
            <strong>[OK, but I suspect ‘transformation’ is pre-contaminated by
              totalitarian aspirations.]</strong>
            The Chilean Project Cybersyn is em­blem­atic of this ex­per­i­mental
            at­ti­tude — fusing ad­vanced cy­ber­netic tech­no­lo­gies, with
            soph­ist­ic­ated eco­nomic mod­el­ling, and a demo­cratic plat­form
            in­stan­ti­ated in the tech­no­lo­gical in­fra­struc­ture it­self.
            Similar ex­per­i­ments were con­ducted in 1950s – 1960s Soviet
            eco­nomics as well, em­ploying cy­ber­netics and linear pro­gram­ming
            in an at­tempt to over­come the new prob­lems faced by the first
            com­munist eco­nomy. That both of these were ul­ti­mately
            un­suc­cessful can be traced to the polit­ical and tech­no­lo­gical
            con­straints these early cy­ber­net­i­cians op­er­ated under.

            11. The left must de­velop so­ci­o­tech­nical he­ge­mony: both in the
            sphere of ideas, and in the sphere of ma­terial plat­forms. Platforms
            are the in­fra­struc­ture of global so­ciety. They es­tab­lish the
            basic para­meters of what is pos­sible, both be­ha­vi­our­ally and
            ideo­lo­gic­ally. In this sense, they em­body the ma­terial
            tran­scend­ental of so­ciety: they are what make pos­sible
            par­tic­ular sets of ac­tions, re­la­tion­ships, and powers. While
            much of the cur­rent global plat­form is biased to­wards cap­it­alist
            so­cial re­la­tions, this is not an in­ev­it­able ne­ces­sity. These
            ma­terial plat­forms of pro­duc­tion, fin­ance, lo­gistics, and
            con­sump­tion can and will be re­pro­grammed and re­formatted to­wards
            post-​capitalist ends.

            12. We do not be­lieve that direct ac­tion is suf­fi­cient to achieve
            any of this. The ha­bitual tac­tics of marching, holding signs, and
            es­tab­lishing tem­porary autonomous zones risk be­coming com­forting
            sub­sti­tutes for ef­fective suc­cess. “At least we have done
            some­thing” is the ral­lying cry of those who priv­ilege self-​esteem
            rather than ef­fective ac­tion. The only cri­terion of a good tactic
            is whether it en­ables sig­ni­ficant suc­cess or not. We must be done
            with fet­ish­ising par­tic­ular modes of ac­tion. Politics must be
            treated as a set of dy­namic sys­tems, riven with con­flict,
            ad­apt­a­tions and counter-​adaptations, and stra­tegic arms races.
            This means that each in­di­vidual type of polit­ical ac­tion be­comes
            blunted and in­ef­fective over time as the other sides adapt. No given
            mode of polit­ical ac­tion is his­tor­ic­ally in­vi­ol­able. Indeed,
            over time, there is an in­creasing need to dis­card fa­miliar tac­tics
            as the forces and en­tities they are mar­shalled against learn to
            de­fend and counter-​attack them ef­fect­ively. It is in part the
            con­tem­porary left’s in­ab­ility to do so which lies close to the
            heart of the con­tem­porary malaise.

            13. The over­whelming priv­ileging of democracy-​as-​process needs to
            be left be­hind. The fet­ish­isa­tion of open­ness, ho­ri­zont­ality,
            and in­clu­sion of much of today’s ‘rad­ical’ left set the stage for
            in­ef­fect­ive­ness. Secrecy, ver­tic­ality, and ex­clu­sion all have
            their place as well in ef­fective polit­ical ac­tion (though not, of
            course, an ex­clusive one).
          </p>
          <p>
            14. Democracy cannot be defined simply by its means — not via voting,
            dis­cus­sion, or gen­eral as­sem­blies. Real demo­cracy must be
            defined by its goal — col­lective self-​mastery. This is a pro­ject
            which must align politics with the legacy of the Enlightenment, to the
            ex­tent that it is only through har­nessing our ability to
            un­der­stand ourselves and our world better (our so­cial, tech­nical,
            eco­nomic, psy­cho­lo­gical world) that we can come to rule ourselves.
            We need to posit a col­lect­ively con­trolled le­git­imate ver­tical
            au­thority in ad­di­tion to dis­trib­uted ho­ri­zontal forms of
            so­ciality, to avoid be­coming the slaves of either a tyr­an­nical
            to­tal­it­arian cent­ralism or a ca­pri­cious emer­gent order beyond
            our con­trol. The com­mand of The Plan must be mar­ried to the
            im­pro­vised order of The Network.
          </p>
          <p>
            15. We do not present any par­tic­ular or­gan­isa­tion as the ideal
            means to em­body these vec­tors. What is needed — what has al­ways
            been needed — is an eco­logy of or­gan­isa­tions, a plur­alism of
            forces, res­on­ating and feeding back on their com­par­ative
            strengths. Sectarianism is the death knell of the left as much as
            cent­ral­iz­a­tion is, and in this re­gard we con­tinue to wel­come
            ex­per­i­ment­a­tion with dif­ferent tac­tics (even those we dis­agree
            with).
          </p>
          <p>
            16. We have three me­dium term con­crete goals. First, we need to
            build an in­tel­lec­tual in­fra­struc­ture. Mimicking the Mont Pelerin
            Society of the neo­lib­eral re­volu­tion, this is to be tasked with
            cre­ating a new ideo­logy, eco­nomic and so­cial models, and a vision
            of the good to re­place and sur­pass the ema­ci­ated ideals that rule
            our world today. This is an in­fra­struc­ture in the sense of
            re­quiring the con­struc­tion not just of ideas, but in­sti­tu­tions
            and ma­terial paths to in­cul­cate, em­body and spread them.
          </p>
          <p>
            17. We need to con­struct wide-​scale media re­form. In spite of the
            seeming demo­crat­isa­tion offered by the in­ternet and so­cial media,
            tra­di­tional media out­lets re­main cru­cial in the se­lec­tion and
            framing of nar­rat­ives, along with pos­sessing the funds to
            pro­secute in­vest­ig­ative journ­alism. Bringing these bodies as
            close as pos­sible to pop­ular con­trol is cru­cial to un­doing the
            cur­rent present­a­tion of the state of things.
          </p>
          <p>
            18. Finally, we need to re­con­sti­tute various forms of class power.
            Such a re­con­sti­t­u­tion must move beyond the no­tion that an
            or­gan­ic­ally gen­er­ated global pro­let­ariat already ex­ists.
            Instead it must seek to knit to­gether a dis­parate array of par­tial
            pro­let­arian iden­tities, often em­bodied in post-​Fordist forms of
            pre­carious labour.
          </p>
          <p>
            19. Groups and in­di­viduals are already at work on each of these, but
            each is on their own in­suf­fi­cient. What is re­quired is all three
            feeding back into one an­other, with each modi­fying the
            con­tem­porary con­junc­tion in such a way that the others be­come
            more and more ef­fective. A pos­itive feed­back loop of
            in­fra­struc­tural, ideo­lo­gical, so­cial and eco­nomic
            trans­form­a­tion, gen­er­ating a new com­plex he­ge­mony, a new
            post-​capitalist tech­noso­cial plat­form. History demon­strates it
            has al­ways been a broad as­semblage of tac­tics and or­gan­isa­tions
            which has brought about sys­tem­atic change; these les­sons must be
            learned.

            <strong>“A positive feedback loop” — finally, a theoretical connection to
              the topic of acceleration. Having bypassed any serious analysis of
              the actual capitalist positive feedback loop — upon which the entire
              historical topic of acceleration rests — it is now introduced in
              purely speculative fashion, in relation to yet-non-existent Left
              Accelerationist program. The parasitical structure of this argument

          <p>
            20. To achieve each of these goals, on the most prac­tical level we
            hold that the ac­cel­er­a­tionist left must think more ser­i­ously
            about the flows of re­sources and money re­quired to build an
            ef­fective new polit­ical in­fra­struc­ture. Beyond the ‘people power’
            of bodies in the street, we re­quire funding, whether from
            gov­ern­ments, in­sti­tu­tions, think tanks, unions, or in­di­vidual
            be­ne­factors. We con­sider the loc­a­tion and con­duc­tion of such
            funding flows es­sen­tial to begin re­con­structing an eco­logy of
            ef­fective ac­cel­er­a­tionist left organizations.

            21. We de­clare that only a Promethean politics of max­imal mas­tery
            over so­ciety and its en­vir­on­ment is cap­able of either dealing
            with global prob­lems or achieving vic­tory over cap­ital. This
            mas­tery must be dis­tin­guished from that be­loved of thinkers of the
            ori­ginal Enlightenment. The clock­work uni­verse of Laplace, so
            easily mastered given suf­fi­cient in­form­a­tion, is long gone from
            the agenda of ser­ious sci­entific un­der­standing. But this is not to
            align ourselves with the tired residue of post­mod­ernity, de­crying
            mas­tery as proto-​fascistic or au­thority as in­nately
            il­le­git­imate. Instead we pro­pose that the prob­lems be­set­ting
            our planet and our spe­cies ob­lige us to re­fur­bish mas­tery in a
            newly com­plex guise; whilst we cannot pre­dict the pre­cise result of
            our ac­tions, we can de­termine prob­ab­il­ist­ic­ally likely ranges
            of out­comes. What must be coupled to such com­plex sys­tems ana­lysis
            is a new form of ac­tion: im­pro­vis­atory and cap­able of ex­ecuting
            a design through a prac­tice which works with the con­tin­gen­cies it
            dis­covers only in the course of its acting, in a politics of
            geo­so­cial artistry and cun­ning ra­tion­ality. A form of ab­ductive
            ex­per­i­ment­a­tion that seeks the best means to act in a com­plex
            world.

            22. We need to re­vive the ar­gu­ment that was tra­di­tion­ally made
            for post-​capitalism: not only is cap­it­alism an un­just and
            per­verted system, but it is also a system that holds back pro­gress.
            <strong>[Still entirely unsubstantiated.]</strong> Our
            tech­no­lo­gical de­vel­op­ment is being sup­pressed by cap­it­alism,
            as much as it has been un­leashed.
            <strong>[Ditto.]</strong> Accelerationism is the basic be­lief that
            these ca­pa­cities can and should be let loose by moving beyond the
            lim­it­a­tions im­posed by cap­it­alist so­ciety.
            <strong>[Ditto.]</strong> The move­ment to­wards a sur­passing of our
            cur­rent con­straints must in­clude more than simply a struggle for a
            more ra­tional global so­ciety. We be­lieve it must also in­clude
            re­cov­ering the dreams which trans­fixed many from the middle of the
            Nineteenth Century until the dawn of the neo­lib­eral era, of the
            quest of Homo Sapiens to­wards ex­pan­sion beyond the lim­it­a­tions
            of the earth and our im­me­diate bodily forms. These vis­ions are
            today viewed as relics of a more in­no­cent mo­ment. Yet they both
            dia­gnose the stag­gering lack of ima­gin­a­tion in our own time, and
            offer the promise of a fu­ture that is af­fect­ively in­vig­or­ating,
            as well as in­tel­lec­tu­ally en­er­gising. After all, it is only a
            post-​capitalist so­ciety, made pos­sible by an ac­cel­er­a­tionist
            politics, which will ever be cap­able of de­liv­ering on the
            promis­sory note of the mid-​Twentieth Century’s space pro­grammes, to
            shift beyond a world of min­imal tech­nical up­grades to­wards
            all-​encompassing change. Towards a time of col­lective self-​mastery,
            and the prop­erly alien fu­ture that en­tails and en­ables. Towards a
            com­ple­tion of the Enlightenment pro­ject of self-​criticism and
            self-​mastery, rather than its elimination.

            per­petual crisis, and plan­etary eco­lo­gical collapse.<strong>

              before gasping at the final mountain of rice that towers above the

            <em><a

            positions itself very clearly within a Marxian intellectual tradition.
            In this respect, it remains consistent with the main current of
            ‘accelerationist’ thinking as it has developed from the Marx of
            <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, through Marx’s later writings on
            imperialism and international relations, and into the
            ‘Nietzscheanized’ quasi-Marxism of Deleuze, Guattari, and Lyotard. The
            constant political recommendation across this diverse heritage is
            alignment with the capitalistic social revolution, in order to realize
            its ultimate eschatalogical implication. To interrupt capitalistic
            development is to retard the formation of the final revolutionary
            class — the radically-industrialized international proletariat (or
            whatever decoded schizo-swarms it later becomes). Hence the defining
            imperative slogan of Deleuze &amp; Guattari:
            <em>Accelerate the process</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond this point, however, obscurity gathers rapidly. In particular,
            is in entirely unclear which broad trend of Marxist theory is being
            extrapolated. From the available rhetorical clues, it does not seem as
            though <em>#Accelerate</em> endorses the wholesale deleuzoguattarian
            break from classical Marxism — crossing the theoretical catastrophe
            that includes abandonment of the Law of Value (in an embrace of
            ‘machinic surplus value’, ‘machinic value of code’, and marginalism);
            differentiation of ‘capitalism’ and market economics (following
            Braudel); denunciation of state socialism as a regressive ‘Oriental
            Despotism’ (following Wittfogel); and a dehumanization of the
            revolutionary subject without obvious limits (drawing upon sources
            from Samuel Butler to Antonin Artaud). If this were the vector
            pursued, it would — surely — be vividly evident?
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-320"></span>Assuming, then, that #Accelerate backs into
            a more recognizable Marxian framework, how is this theoretical
            structure to be understood? The decisive question internal to the
            (serious) Marxist tradition concerns the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_problem">Transformation Problem</a>, since it is only
            if
            this is considered soluble that anything like a
            continuity of classical Marxism (or credible ‘Law of Value’) can be
            envisaged at all. It is worth recalling that comprehensive critics of
            Marx — those who find nothing of positive significance to be
            salvageable from his work — have, beginning
            <a href="http://mises.org/books/karlmarx.pdf">with</a> Böhm-Bawerk,
            taken the Transformation Problem as the completion of Marx’s
            <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the Labor Theory of Value (as
            inherited from Smith and Ricardo), seeing the rigorous economic
            meaning of the Marxian system as entirely exhausted in this
            demonstration. To remain a Marxist in anything other than an absurd
            sense depends upon some other path having been taken,
            <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/hilferding/1904/criticism/">but</a>

            <em>#Accelerate</em> offers no obvious indications. (The literature
            on this is vast, so it would be useful to know where to focus.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a resolution of the Transformation Problem — and even a
            well-positioned sticking plaster would do provisionally — there can be
            no consistent concept of exploitation, or even a theoretically
            significant sense of labor time. This is especially relevant because
            it plays such a crucial role in Antonio Negri’s
            <a href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2014/02/26/reflections-accelerate-manifesto/">response</a>
            to <em>#Accelerate</em>, which picks up on a tantalizing remark in the
            manifesto itself:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              All of us want to work less. It is an in­triguing ques­tion as to
              why it was that the world’s leading eco­nomist of the post-​war era
              be­lieved that an en­lightened cap­it­alism in­ev­it­ably
              pro­gressed to­wards a rad­ical re­duc­tion of working hours. In The
              Economic Prospects for Our Grandchildren (written in 1930), Keynes
              fore­cast a cap­it­alist fu­ture where in­di­viduals would have
              their work re­duced to three hours a day. What has in­stead
              oc­curred is the pro­gressive elim­in­a­tion of the work-​life
              dis­tinc­tion, with work coming to per­meate every as­pect of the
              emer­ging so­cial factory.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Is Left Accelerationism promoting itself as the redeemer of Keynes’
            empty promise? From the bare descriptiveness of this (vaguely
            mournful) passage it is hard to know. What we can know, with
            confidence, is that work time cannot be anything but an axial topic
            within this entire discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Law of Value is to be defended, value production is measured in
            (labor) time. Marx’s transformation factor is designed to conserve the
            equation between quantified — timed — work and economic values, as
            expressed in prices. If this patch fails, the entire analysis of
            <em>Capital</em> loses application to determinate social fact. There
            would be no Marxian economics at all (a conclusion Negri and the
            Autonomists seem willing to accept).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is hard to see how a Left Accelerationism could be maintained under
            these conditions. Historical time would no longer have any calculable
            relation to labor commoditization, working life, or any constructable
            proletarian class identity. The real time of (capitalistic) modernity
            — onto which accelerationism latches — could no longer be described as
            the time of work. At the limit, human work-forces are relegated to
            “aphidian parasites of the machines”. Once the class struggle over
            labor time is divorced from a fully-determining role in the production
            of value, the proletariat is stripped of the potential to incarnate
            history for-itself, consigning ‘Marxism’ over to an articulation of
            marginal grievances, and ultimately to the heat death of identity
            politics. (This, of course, is exactly the trend that has been
            sociologically apparent.)
          </p>
          <p>
            One final crude point for now. As a fundamental cybernetic theory,
            accelerationism is bound to the identification of a socially central,
            positive feedback loop, through which modernity is propelled. It thus
            requires — at a minimum — twin quantitative variables entangled in a
            relation of reciprocal stimulation. Industrial capitalism, with its
            intrinsic ‘technonomic’ duality of cross-exciting technical and
            commercial dynamics, makes the application of the cybernetic diagram
            relatively non-problematic. With or without the Law of Value, the
            accelerationist schema cannot but interlock tightly with the most
            prominent contours of modernity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not time-denominated (‘living’ and ‘dead’) labor, however, what is
            the variable being cumulated? That’s the question to carry forwards.
            The question for now: if labor is the cumulative factor in the
            accelerationist analysis, how can a practical critique of labor time
            be anything other than a politics of deceleration?

          <p>
            Assume — at least provisionally — that Accelerationism is serious.
            While abstracted from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration">physics</a>, the
            concept of acceleration is not reduced to mere rhetoric (or metaphor),
            even if it is no longer applied to changes in the velocity of objects
            in space. It refers strictly to change of the first derivative (or
            higher) in a measurable quantity across time, formally compliant with
            the differential calculus. The rate of acceleration — or system
            performance — can be estimated in principle, even if practical
            considerations complicate this task. In other words, the object of
            accelerationist attention (and promotion) has demonstrable reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intellectual history of industrial capitalism advances two streams
            of (quantitative) information, both of great apparent relevance. On
            its technical side, it produces an apparatus of rigorous measurement
            directed to the behavior of complex physical systems, or machines —
            temperature differences, free energy, thermodynamic efficiency,
            entropy dissipation, complexity, information, and (emergently)
            intelligence. On its commercial side it establishes institutions of
            accountancy and econometrics, denominated in currency units, and
            applied to economic production, income, taxes, trade flows, credit,
            asset values, and increasingly exotic financial instruments. While an
            argument could be made that the confluence of these two streams is
            implicit within — and even essential to — the nature (or culture) of
            capitalism, with intelligence-price discovery as its immanent
            epistemological directive, no such results are readily or publicly
            available. There might even be reasons for suspecting that the raw
            question
            <em>how much is intelligence worth?</em> cannot be overtly articulated
            within any imaginable social order. It is, in any case, a distraction
            at this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-333"></span>Despite remarkable
            <a
              href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02011/jul/25/why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-always-die-and-life-gets-faster/">progress</a>
            in the technical study of ever-larger complex objects, and the obvious
            relevance of this work to accelerationist concerns, it is the
            socio-economical rather than the techno-mechanical mode of
            quantification that is advantaged in the analysis of very large scale
            systems, especially in regards to those entities — up to the level of
            the global economy — which have monetized their own processes, and
            thus
            <em>quantified themselves prior to their theoretical
              objectification</em>. The enormous theoretical relief provided in this way is such that
            even the most severe conceptual difficulties (with which we shall soon
            collide) are unable entirely to annul it. (Information sciences offer
            comparable relief on the technical side, but it is restricted solely
            to the domain of artificial digital machines.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The compelling attraction of a comprehensive, rigorous,
            non-anthropomorphic apprehension of terrestrial modernity as a complex
            system, machine, or emergent individual, to be described through its
            thermodynamic, dissipative, or intelligenic properties, is such that
            this aspiration is unlikely to be wholly excised from the
            accelerationist intellectual program (as it exists, and as it will
            necessarily exist due to systemically-generated modernist impulses).
            Despite this, it is probably uncontroversial to expect the
            consolidation of accelerationist theory to initially take shape
            through reference to cultural resources of economic description,
            analysis, explanation, and practical proposition. The first
            intellectually credible version of accelerationism cannot
            realistically be anything other than a global economic theory of
            modernity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A global theory of modernity? You mean, like Marxism?” Yes, in a way,
            very much like Marxism. The tracks are already set in a direction that
            allows only two destinations: Accelerationism can either
            <em>be</em> Marxism, or its substitute — an upgrade or a competitor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tracks lead across the same country in either case, at least
            initially. It is worth sketching out some shared presuppositions, to
            be inherited by whatever Accelerationism becomes.
          </p>

            (1) The tendential globality of Capitalism is a signature of its
            virtual singularity (as a real individual) and not merely an effect of
            generalization across space. ‘Terrestrial Capitalism’ (or whatever
            else we might want to call it) is the proper name of a thing, rather
            than a generic label. It is an occurrence, or machine, before it is
            any kind of social type.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) Capitalism is at least integral to <em>actual</em> modernity, if
            not (in its own actuality) unambiguously coincident with it. A
            completed theory of capitalism — however hypothetical this idea has to
            be — would <em>explain</em> modernity, across all its distinctive
            features, including the genesis and destiny of (modern)
            anti-capitalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) Capitalism is essentially cumulative. It is not something to which
            growth can be attributed as an extrinsic property. Even occasions of
            capitalist shrinkage or contraction are restricted to specific
            dimensions, and intelligible only through an enveloping expansionary
            trend.
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) The self-propelling growth that — when adequately understood —
            defines capitalism is necessarily expressed as an economic index. An
            economic meta-theory capable of decrypting this index, through some
            set of consistent mathematical transformations of the system’s own
            price information, is able to access data sufficient to support the
            body of empirical conclusions and projections that make up the
            accelerationist description of capitalism. This theory, therefore,
            will be denominated in units of economic value strictly isomorphic
            with those composing the planetary aggregate of effectively
            monetizable wealth (whose extreme speculative virtuality describes the
            horizon of economic-theoretical possibility).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is notable that at some stage in point (4), this enumeration of
            shared presuppositions switches over into something else.<br />

            “If any system has been associated with ideas of acceleration it is
            capitalism,” says
            <a
              href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/"><em>#Accelerate</em></a>,
            unobjectionably. “The essential metabolism of capitalism demands
            economic growth, with competition between individual capitalist
            entities setting in motion increasing technological developments in an
            attempt to achieve competitive advantage, all accompanied by
            increasing social dislocation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As previously
            <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/on-accelerate-2a/">noted</a>, of the
            trends referenced here “economic growth” is easily the most accessible
            (due to its commercial self-quantification). The technoscientific
            apprehension of technoscience, while already embryonic at the
            beginning of the modern epoch, is still some distance from
            mathematical self-comprehension as a natural event. Its
            quantification, therefore, poses far more challenging problems,
            leaving even very basic questions about its trend-lines
            <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/technological-progress-thing-past">open</a>

            sectors merit focused attention at a later stage.) Any attempt to
            provide a precise and coherent measurement of “social dislocation” is
            likely to confront even more formidable obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capitalism present itself as the exemplary accelerative mega-object
            because it is self-propelling and (cross-excitedly) self-abstracting.
            In both its technical and commercial aspects, it tends towards
            general-purpose potentials that facilitate resource re-allocations
            (and thus efficient quantifications). Productive capability is
            plasticized, becoming increasingly responsive to shifting market
            opportunities, while wealth is fluidized, permitting its rapid
            speculative mobilization. The same self-reinforcing process that
            <em>liquidates</em> traditional social forms releases modernizing
            capital as volatile abstract quantity, flexibly poised between
            technical applications, and inclined intrinsically towards a ‘decoded’
            or economistic apprehension.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-339"></span>Under capital guidance, the modernization
            of wealth tends to the realization of
            <em>abstract productive potential</em>, which is of course to say: it
            tends towards capital itself, in the circuit of self-propulsion that
            determines it as a genetic (or even teleological) hyper-substance. At
            this point a complex theoretical fork is reached, from which paths
            lead in a number of Marxian and decidedly anti-Marxian directions. The
            primary question is whether the abstract body of capital is
            susceptible to a consistent mathematical conversion conforming to the
            Law of Value, which interprets it as a reification of organically
            composed (variable and fixed, or ‘living’ and ‘dead’) labor power. Can
            the accelerative thing be practically recognized as the alienated
            collective capability of a future classless humanity?
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>#Accelerate</em> considers this question to have been
            satisfactorily resolved in advance, and answered in the affirmative.
            Since it provides no supporting references in support of this stance,
            it has to be considered a left-identitarian document. Only those who
            affirm the prior closure of its fundamental questions are able to
            access it at the level of its own rhetoric. It assumes ideological
            solidarity as an extrinsic, and unmarked, preliminary.
          </p>
          <p>
            To intrude, nevertheless, from an open problem of capitalist ontology,
            is to navigate chaos. The relevant passages are found in the second
            part of the manifesto, which consists of seven numbered paragraphs.
            Whatever we are told about the accelerative thing has to be extracted
            from these … or almost everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is remarkable that the first use of ‘accelerate’ in the manifesto
            is both critical, and almost dismissively casual. In occurs in the
            third paragraph of the introduction, where it summarizes a set of
            “ever-​accelerating catastrophes”:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… breakdown of the planetary climatic system </em>[which
            “threatens the continued existence of the present global human
            population”]
            <em>… Terminal resource depletion, especially in water and energy
              reserves</em>
            [raising “the prospect of mass starvation, collapsing economic
            paradigms, and new hot and cold wars”]
            <em>… continued financial crisis [which] has led governments to embrace
              the paralyzing death spiral policies of austerity, privatisation of
              social welfare services, mass unemployment, and stagnating
              wages.</em>
            [And]
            <em>Increasing automation in production processes including
              ‘intellectual labour’</em>
            [which]
            <em>is evidence of the secular crisis of capitalism, soon to render it
              incapable of maintaining cur­rent standards of living for even the
              former middle classes of the global north.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This, quite clearly, is their lurid introductory portrait of the
            accelerative thing, as it is in-itself, converging upon a terminal
            historical singularity, or comprehensive ecological, economic, and
            technological over-performance crisis. It is both the thing
            <em>#Accelerate</em> wants to talk about, and the thing it decides
            explicitly not to talk about — introduced as theatrical stage setting,
            or a reminder of something before and outside the discussion, which
            can subsequently be assumed. The rhetorical function is completely
            unambiguous: this list serves as an enumeration of
            <em>that which need not be discussed further</em>. It is unfortunate
            therefore, to say the least, that this seems to be the closest
            approximation within <em>#Accelerate</em> to the real object of
            accelerationist attention, “gather[ing] force and speed [as] politics
            withers and retreats” until “the future” we were promised is
            “cancelled” (if only through a rectifiable failure of “the political
            imaginary”). The enemy is an accelerative thing, but
            <em>#Accelerate</em> will be discussing something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before capitalism drops away entirely into the hazy background of
            implicit narrative, it is worth taking a brief digression into “the
            political imaginary” and its suggestion. If there is a single formula
            that crystallizes the left appropriation of accelerationism as sheer
            cognitive collapse it is Frederic Jameson’s claim — obsessively
            repeated across the Left Web — that
            <em>It is now easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine
              the end of capitalism</em>. To grasp the profound mindlessness of this pronouncement it is only
            necessary to return to the thought of <em>real abstraction</em>,
            through which the virtualization <em>realized</em> by capitalism is
            distinguished from any determination of abstraction as a logical
            property of intellectual representation. Within capitalist
            <em>futures markets</em>, the non-actual has effective currency. It is
            not an “imaginary” but an integral part of the virtual body of
            capital, an operationalized <em>realization of the future</em>. It is
            scarcely imaginable that the Left is willing to follow the path it has
            set out upon here, therefore, unless through thoughtlessness of simply
            staggering proportions, since it necessarily leads to the conclusion:
            <em>while capital has an increasingly densely-realized future, its
              leftist enemies have only a manifestly pretend one</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because <em>#Accelerate</em> Section Two is a tightly-tangled thicket
            of conceptual outrages, it is worth recalling once again its first two
            sentences, which are exceptional (in this context) for their
            soundness:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If any system has been associated with ideas of acceleration it is
              capitalism. The essential metabolism of capitalism demands economic
              growth, with competition between individual capitalist entities
              setting in motion increasing technological developments in an
              attempt to achieve competitive advantage, all accompanied by
              increasing social dislocation.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>The primary object of Accelerationism is economic growth, as
              demonstrated capitalistically, in a process inextricably bound to
              competition-driven technological development, and also to social
              disorganization</em>. If <em>#Accelerate</em> concluded here, there would be no case to
            be made against it. Unfortunately it continues through a string of
            such radically disordered sentences that no elegant pursuit of its
            argument is possible. Instead, it demands a piecemeal series of
            corrections, objections, and re-animations of obscured, half-buried,
            and arbitrarily suppressed problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The descent begins immediately: “In its neo­lib­eral form, its
            ideo­lo­gical self-​presentation is one of lib­er­ating the forces of
            cre­ative de­struc­tion, set­ting free ever-​accelerating
            tech­no­lo­gical and so­cial innovations.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is the term ‘creative destruction’ (<a
              href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html">coined</a>
            by Joseph Schumpeter in 1942) being associated with ‘<a
              href="http://www.uf-blog.net/neoliberalism/">neoliberalism</a>‘ here? Schumpeter considered it applicable
            to
            capitalism in general,
            with abundant reason, and <em>#Accelerate</em> articulates no
            objection to this standard usage. If ‘neoliberalism’ is the ideology
            of creative destruction, it is the ideology of capitalism in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the introduction we were told that “since 1979” neoliberalism has
            been “the hegemonic global political ideology … found in some variant
            throughout the leading economic powers.” It is characterized,
            apparently, by “structural adjustments … most significantly in the
            form of encouraging new and aggressive incursions by the private
            sector into what remains of social democratic institutions and
            services.” This, too, sounds like simple capitalism (as does “Landian
            neo­lib­er­alism”). The emptiness of the term only re-echoes
            sonorously with each succeeding use. ‘Neoliberalism’ is criticized
            because it is nothing other than capitalism (post-1979), and it is
            criticized for no other reason. In
            <em>#Accelerate</em>, if not
            <a href="http://www.academia.edu/327085/The_Grammar_of_Neoliberalism">elsewhere</a>, it has no ideological
            content distinguishable from classical
            liberalism, making it a perfectly useless word. The opacity serves
            only to smuggle through two preposterous suggestions:<br />
            (1) The cacophony of leftist critics of ‘neoliberalism’ share some
            coherent core of economic and political analysis.<br />
            (2) Classical liberal socio-economic ideas enjoy an essentially
            unperturbed hegemony over the present world order. (Didn’t you know
            that Keynes was dead, and Libertarians rule the earth?)
          </p>
          <p>
            (So why not start calling today’s fundamentalist Marxists
            ‘neo-collectivists’? while implying that Stalinist industrial
            central-planning is the world’s dominant economic arrangement? —
            <em>Because it would be patently ridiculous and senselessly
              annoying</em>, but actually no more so than the ‘neoliberal’ alternative.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This ‘neoliberal’ tic, while infuriating in its smug idiocy, is
            actually so vacuous that it matters little to the #Accelerate
            argument. Its effect is merely to serve as a sleight of hand,
            presenting a cartoon opponent to distract from the absence of
            concentrated attention upon the target of realistic analysis and
            criticism: the accelerative thing. The second theoretical diversion to
            appear is scarcely less evasive, which is to slide off the core
            ontological problem into a ‘conceptual clarification’ of astounding
            sloppiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know from the children’s dictionary that acceleration is
            <em>a change in speed over time</em>, which does not prevent
            <em>#Accelerate</em> claiming (without any obvious evidence):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The philo­sopher Nick Land cap­tured this [capital dynamic or
              neoliberal ideology?] most acutely, with a my­opic yet hyp­not­ising
              be­lief that capitalist speed alone could gen­erate a global
              trans­ition to­wards un­par­alleled tech­no­lo­gical sin­gu­larity.
              … Landian neo­lib­er­alism con­fuses speed with ac­cel­er­a­tion. We
              may be moving fast, but only within a strictly defined set of
              cap­it­alist para­meters that them­selves never waver. We
              ex­per­i­ence only the in­creasing speed of a local ho­rizon, a
              simple brain-​dead on­rush rather than an ac­cel­er­a­tion which is
              also nav­ig­a­tional, an ex­per­i­mental pro­cess of dis­covery
              within a uni­versal space of pos­sib­ility. It is the latter mode of
              ac­cel­er­a­tion which we hold as essential.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            (1) Speed is not acceleration.<br />
            (2) Approaching singularity is marked by acceleration, not constant
            velocity.<br />
            (3) Who has ever spoken about “moving fast” in this context? It lacks
            even the dignity of a straw-man. What does ‘fast’ mean? Acceleration
            need not even be ‘fast’ (only ‘getting faster’).<br />
            (4) The appeal to something beyond “a strictly defined set of
            cap­it­alist para­meters” is mere hand-waving. Economic functionality
            is a confining ‘parameter’ (for acceleration)? There is clearly an
            attempt at some kind of transcendental argument here, marked by the
            appeal to “cap­it­alist para­meters that them­selves never waver.”
            ‘Parameter’ itself wavers between a logical usage and an empirical
            one, one conceptually defining, and the other materially constraining.
            If
            <em>#Accelerate</em> thinks it can produce a meaningful concept of
            acceleration without parameters, it would be a thrilling thing to see
            (time, terrestrial mass, physical laws, biogeological inheritance …
            are all ‘parameters’). Capitalist ‘parameters’ (undefined) are for
            some reason to be accepted as especially constraining, however.
            Argument? Of course not, this is an article of undisputed faith.<br />
            (5) If anyone knows what “the in­creasing speed of a local ho­rizon”
            means, please let me know. At least it is some kind of “increasing
            speed” though, i.e. an acceleration. Is this a sign that
            <em>#Accelerate</em> thinks the difference between speed and
            acceleration is too trivial to acknowledge, so that its discussion of
            acceleration is actually not about acceleration at, but about
            something much deeper and ‘post-parametric’? Perhaps, because …<br />
            (6) Beyond the “simple brain-​dead on­rush” (something is certainly
            ‘brain-dead’) …<br />
            (7) There is “an ac­cel­er­a­tion which is also nav­ig­a­tional, an
            ex­per­i­mental pro­cess of dis­covery within a uni­versal space of
            pos­sib­ility.” … and this is somehow connected to, measurable as, or
            explained in terms of some rigorously determinable process of
            acceleration (even roughly) how?<br />
            (8) Regardless: “It is the latter mode of ac­cel­er­a­tion which we
            hold as essential.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This sort of thing is the straightforward, radical destruction of
            intelligence. We began with a defined concept (‘acceleration’) and a
            topic of investigation or critique (the accelerative thing). Now, less
            than halfway through <em>#Accelerate</em>, we have neither. Instead,
            we are left with some kind of super-parametric trans-horizonal
            imaginary “mode of ac­cel­er­a­tion” that has been deliberately
            destituted of both sense and reference. The only theoretical
            achievement has been to crudely chisel this conceptually and
            ontologically ineffable political idea away from the only
            historically-evidenced process of accelerating navigation, experiment,
            and discovery known to human history, in order to cast it into a
            mystically-inspiring beyond. Beginning with a
            cybernetically-intelligible self-propelling sociotechnical machine, we
            end with nothing but the adamant declaration that whatever ‘it’
            (historical acceleration) is, it is not <em>this</em>, or anything we
            can understand, despite the fact that what we know of ‘it’ is entirely
            extracted from the cumulative reality being abandoned.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As Marx was aware, cap­it­alism cannot be iden­ti­fied as the agent
              of true ac­cel­er­a­tion.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the contrary. The only “agent of true ac­cel­er­a­tion” recognized
            by Marx is the revolutionary bourgeoisie — his humanistic proxy for
            the agency of capital. The proletariat accelerates nothing, except in
            its function as labor power under capital imperatives. It inherits a
            completed, accelerative pre-history, at the point of its own
            revolutionary auto-dissolution into a universal humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike <em>#Accelerate</em>, Marx labored under no illusion that the
            accelerative thing was capital, whose mechanism he devoted himself to
            understanding, to the near-perfect exclusion of all other topics. In
            turning back to Marx’s understanding of this thing [next week], we
            partially withdraw from the chaotic errors of current Left
            Accelerationism, while perhaps remaining close enough to irritate it.

          <p><strong>A (quick) digression on speed</strong></p>
          <p>
            Acceleration, as Accelerationism employs it, is a concept abstracted
            from physics. In this philosophical (and socio-historical) sense, it
            preserves its mathematical definition (consolidated by the
            differential calculus) as <em>higher derivatives of speed</em>, with
            continued reference to time (change in the rate of change), but with
            re-application from passage through space to the growth of a
            determinable variable. The theoretical integrity of accelerationism,
            therefore, rests upon a rigorous abstraction <em>from</em> and
            <em>of</em> space, in which the dimension of change — as graphed
            against time — is mapped onto an alternative, quantifiable object. The
            implicit complicity of this ‘object’ with the process of abstraction
            itself will ultimately translate into explicit theoretical
            complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flight into abstraction is theoretically snarled by reflexive
            tangles. Comparable difficulties arise on the side of the flight ‘out’
            of space, primarily because the coincidence of intelligibility and
            spatiality tends rather to thicken than dissolve with each further
            increment of abstraction, propelling intelligence into phase-spaces,
            probability-spaces, Cyberspace, and deterritorialization. Space is
            released from its ‘original’ concreteness into the purity of the
            intuitive medium, while acquiring active intelligibility as
            <em>display space</em>, within which concepts become sensible. There
            is no more archaic, or more contemporary, illustration than
            <em>the intuition of time through space</em>, as demonstrated by the
            entire history of horology, the time-line, time dimensionalization,
            and graphed dynamics. Space sticks to measure on its path into
            abstraction, and even leads it there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-348"></span>The <em>insistence</em> of space is also
            demonstrated by a tendency for any abstraction of acceleration to
            undergo <em>reversion</em>, as its index of change is re-attached to
            differentiations of (physical) speed. In the context of the
            <em>Great Stagnation</em>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation">debate</a>
            — the most prominent hiatus within the recent history of
            accelerationist thinking — a highly abstracted notion of (negative)
            technonomic acceleration is restored to <em>measure</em> in exactly
            this way.

              href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/articles/2012/02/01/a-conversation-with-peter-thiel/">interview</a>
            with Francis Fukuyama, Peter Thiel demonstrates the process:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              … you have … two different blind spots on the Left and Right, but
              I’ve been more interested in their common blind spot, which we’re
              less likely to discuss as a society: technological deceleration and
              the question of whether we’re still living in a technologically
              advancing society at all. I believe that the late 1960s was not only
              a time when government stopped working well and various aspects of
              our social contract began to fray, but also when scientific and
              technological progress began to advance much more slowly. Of course,
              the computer age, with the internet and web 2.0 developments of the
              past 15 years, is an exception. Perhaps so is finance, which has
              seen a lot of innovation over the same period (too much innovation,
              some would argue).
            </p>
            <p>
              There has been a tremendous slowdown everywhere else, however. Look
              at transportation, for example: Literally, we haven’t been moving
              any faster.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In an earlier
            <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/278758/end-future-peter-thiel">article</a>, published in
            <em>National Review</em>, Thiel refers explictly to a
            “measurement problem” — at once theoretical and political —
            obstructing reliable estimates of techno-scientific development. While
            important to acknowledge, he advises, it should not “stop our inquiry
            into modernity before it has even begun”:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              When tracked against the admittedly lofty hopes of the 1950s and
              1960s, technological progress has fallen short in many domains.
              Consider the most literal instance of non-acceleration: We are no
              longer moving faster. The centuries-long acceleration of travel
              speeds — from ever-faster sailing ships in the 16th through 18th
              centuries, to the advent of ever-faster railroads in the 19th
              century, and ever-faster cars and airplanes in the 20th century —
              reversed with the decommissioning of the Concorde in 2003, to say
              nothing of the nightmarish delays caused by strikingly low-tech
              post-9/11 airport-security systems. Today’s advocates of space jets,
              lunar vacations, and the manned exploration of the solar system
              appear to hail from another planet. A faded 1964 Popular Science
              cover story — “Who’ll Fly You at 2,000 m.p.h.?” — barely recalls the
              dreams of a bygone age.
            </p>
            <p>
              The official explanation for the slowdown in travel centers on the
              high cost of fuel, which points to the much larger failure in energy
              innovation. …
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Notably, in an assessment of the anomalous rapidity of computer
            innovation, he re-<a
              href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/278758/end-future-peter-thiel/page/0/1">poses</a>
            the “measurement problem” in terms familiar (much more recently) from
            <em>#Accelerate</em>: “how does one measure the difference between
            progress and mere change? How much is there of each?” His procedure
            then anticipates the one recommended throughout this series:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Let us now try to tackle this very thorny measurement problem from a
              very different angle. If meaningful scientific and technological
              progress occurs, then we reasonably would expect greater economic
              prosperity (though this may be offset by other factors). And also in
              reverse: If economic gains, as measured by certain key indicators,
              have been limited or nonexistent, then perhaps so has scientific and
              technological progress. Therefore, to the extent that economic
              growth is easier to quantify than scientific or technological
              progress, economic numbers will contain indirect but important clues
              to our larger investigation.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Theoretical necessity drives us from physical space into economic
            abstraction. It is only realistic, however, to be prepared for the
            ways in which — according to deep and obscure necessities — this path
            will be curved by the insistent return of space. Of all those things
            with over-confidence in their own powers of acceleration, or smooth
            attainment of escape velocity, philosophical abstraction is by no
            means the least susceptible to counter-productive — and delusive —
            haste.

            Left Accelerationism undergoes further consolidation, assisted by two
            high-quality posts, from
            <a href="http://fractalontology.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/technoscience-and-expressionism/">Fractal

          </p>
          <p>
            Since Left-framing is a transcendental condition of publicization in
            the present world order, UF is encouraged to see it being done well.
            The implications of this development are inextricable from the core
            controversy at issue: Can acceleration be extracted from its
            capitalist matrix for socialist redeployment? Left Accelerationists,
            confident that this is possible, are setting out to demonstrate it.
            Right Accelerationists, no less confident of its impossibility, have
            no incentive to obstruct them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If capital can be exceeded, it deserves to be (by Natural Law). If it
            cannot, strenuous efforts to exceed it produce tangled elaborations of
            its potencies. Complexity, competition, pressure, and experimentation
            are what accelerationism is for.

            Working on a re-ignition of the <em>On #Accelerate series</em> (which
            is still awaiting #3) has involved a re-reading of Pete Wolfendale’s
            recent
            <a
              href="http://deontologistics.tumblr.com/post/91953882443/so-accelerationism-whats-all-that-about">defense</a>
            of Left Accelerationism (against Malcolm Harris’
            <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/turn-down-for-what/">critique</a>). As previously
            <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/the-left-turn/">noted</a> (briefly),
            it’s good.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strength of Wolfendale’s case against Harris is not a topic this
            blog can credibly pronounce upon, since it rests upon the rhetorical
            efficiency of socialist political mobilization, and thus a very
            peculiar anthopological territory (though an entertaining one).
            Socialist reason that does not pass into or through political action
            is exposed as unreason by history. The ‘force’ of Wolfendale’s case,
            in this respect, is therefore inextricable from the organizational
            dynamics of his ideological tribe. (It is not a constituency
            <em>UF</em> pretends to court.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The article merits appreciation here due to the accuracy with which it
            depicts the schism between Left and Right Accelerationist currents. He
            asks: “… what precisely should be accelerated?” The imperative form of
            this question is the signature of its Left orientation, but in every
            other respect it is impressively, and neutrally, on target. He
            continues:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Well, as the difference between left and right accelerationism
              shows, there’s a good deal of disagreement about this. […]
              Left-accelerationism begins from the premise that the
              deterritorialising force is not capitalism itself, but that the
              transition from feudalism to capitalism was the expression of an
              emancipatory drive that capitalism’s reterritorialising dynamics has
              systematically (but never wholly) suppressed. The various
              genealogical indices within the [<a
                href="http://www.urbanomic.com/pub_accelerate.php">Accelerationist</a>]
              reader present a number of ways of thinking about the nature of
              this drive (e.g., Marx’s Prometheanism, Federov’s cosmism, Veblen’s
              machine-process, etc.), and the various original contributions
              present ways of reconceiving and appropriating these (e.g., Srnicek
              &amp; Williams’ project of collective self-mastery, Singleton’s
              generalised escapology, Negarestani’s inhumanism, etc.).</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The fissure is thus perfectly clear. Left Accelerationism rests
            fundamentally upon the contention that the modern social order
            includes an accelerative motor distinguishable from the capitalist
            mechanism. In the best case (philosophically speaking) intellectual
            proceedings will therefore lead to a clinical analysis and
            delimitation of capital circuitry, in order to describe, alongside it,
            a
            <em>quite other</em> historical dynamo, to which the capital
            accumulation process relates as a constriction. This is, as far as I
            am aware, work that remains to be completed (whether from Left or
            Right). Accelerationism in general requires a coherent capital theory,
            with which acceleration is to be identified, or differentiated.
            Appropriately enough, the task begins to look like a race.

              Anacceleration worthy of name would take acceleration of the

            In the admittedly oddly-angled opinion of this blog, the final tweet
            in this sequence is the most theoretically significant statement of
            Left Accelerationist purpose since the 19th century. Attenuation of
            socially necessary labor time has to be arithmetically integrated with
            the concept of ‘acceleration’ for a seam of Marxian continuity to be
            pursued.

            Even speaking as an adversary, it’s worth pointing out that the

            still get Right Accelerationism for free. Head for spiritual

            <em>The difference between the experimentalism of ‘folk politics’ and
              the trial and error of Srnicek and Williams boils down to a question
              of scale. The most biting elements of their critique of current
              radical practices, such as direct democracy, is that they are
              difficult to ‘scale up’ beyond local and parochial zones of action,
              and it is this limitation which prevents the contemporary left from
              presenting a real threat to capitalism. Surprisingly, then,
              <strong>Inventing the Future</strong> implicitly conjures a
              distinctly <strong>national</strong> politics, geared towards
              achieving parliamentary dominance in North/Western democratic
              states. Their legislative wish-list – investment in automation, the
              provision of basic income, shortening the working week and so on –
              remain tied to national politics in an era of ever-more global and
              mobile capital. To be sure, the threat of capital upping sticks and
              investing elsewhere at the mere mention of greater concessions to
              labour are overstated, but without a
              <strong>global compact</strong> in which common labour standards are
              adhered to around the world, the reality of a post-work regime in
              one country would either be capital flight or the out-sourcing of
              exploitation to poorer countries (in other words, further
              exacerbating the current global division of labour). Not for nothing
              are the authors forced to rely on a vague hope that the rest of the
              world will take care of itself …</em>

          <p>
            <em>… it’s clear that capitalism is creating potentials – not just
              technological, but organizational potentials – which could be
              adapted in a transformed manner to create a very different type of
              society. The evident example is the huge possibilities for freeing
              up time by automation of certain types of work. For me, the problem
              both with Paul [Mason]’s work, which I respect, and with the
              accelerationists, is there is a failure to acknowledge that the
              passage from the potential to the actualization of such communist
              possibilities involves crossing what William Morris describes as a
              “river of fire.” I don’t find in their work a great deal about that
              river of fire. I think it would be reasonable to assume there would
              be a period of massive and protracted social crisis that would
              attend the emergence of these new forms. And as we know from
              historical attempts in the 20th Century to cross that river of fire,
              a lot depends on what happens during that passage. So there is, if
              one could put it that way, a certain
              <strong>automatism</strong> about the prediction of the realization
              of a new order in both these schools, which we should be very
              careful about.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            (What automation wants — be definition — is more of itself. There’s a
            name for that, and it isn’t ‘communism’.)

            The embedded link is well-worth looking at. It’s what Left
            Acceleration thinks a sane — or only moderately sociopathic — Right
            would look like (I’m guessing), and what Right Accelerationism thinks
            a non-retarded Left would look like (I’m sure).

        <h5><em>P2P or not 2P, that is the question</em></h5>
        <p>
          As the US dollar reaches depths of debasement that would have stretched
          the imagination of Caligula, people have been
          <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/index.ht%20%20m" target="_blank">searching</a>
          for alternative candidates for a global reserve currency. The problem is
          formidable. The Euro and Japanese Yen face comparable calamities of
          their own (mixing debt crisis and demographic collapse), the Chinese
          Yuan is non-convertible, and the IMF’s hybrid Special Drawing Rights
          (SDRs) merely bundle together a group of troubled fiat currencies under
          a technocratic acronym.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precious metals enthusiasts have an obvious option, and one that is
          already being spontaneously exercised. Yet whilst growing numbers will
          no doubt cling to gold and silver as financial lifeboats, their wider
          use as currency (as opposed to stores of value) is obstructed by an
          intimidating range of technical and political problems. They are not
          digitally transferable without complicated mediating instruments, and
          they remain exposed to extreme political risk – financial crises have
          been regularly accompanied by
          <a href="http://www.the-privateer.com/1933-gold-confiscation.html" target="_blank">seizures</a>
          and
          <a href="http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/origins-of-the-chinese-hyperinflation/"
            target="_blank">controls</a>
          directed at private precious metals holdings and transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To overcome such problems, a currency would need to be structurally
          immunized against the depredations of central bankers, to share the
          deflationary bias of precious metals, and to participate fully in the
          technical trend towards mathematical abstraction and electronic
          communicability, whilst also enjoying strong cryptographic protection
          against surveillance, expropriation, and fraud. Astonishingly, such a
          currency seems already to exist. Its name is ‘Bitcoin’.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twin, interactive drivers of modernity – commerce and technology –
          come together in Bitcoin with unprecedented fusional intensity. This is
          a currency that is simultaneously an open source computer program,
          entirely native to cyberspace, and a financial innovation, conducting a
          real-time experiment that is at once social, technical, and economic.
          Built on the foundations of public key encryption (PKE), it creates a
          peer-to-peer open network – without any controlling node or
          discretionary human management – to sustain a radically decentralized
          monetary system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally devised by Satoshi Nakamoto (whose outline paper can be found
          <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>),
          Bitcoin disconnects trust from authority. In particular, it is designed
          to overcome the problem of double spending.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because digital ‘goods’ can be replicated at near-zero cost, they are
          economically defined as ‘non-rivalrous’. If you sell me a computer, I
          now own it, and you do not. As with all rivalrous goods, ownership
          implies exclusion. If you sell me a computer program, on the other hand,
          there is no reason to assume that you have not kept a copy for yourself,
          or that the ‘same’ program could not be sold to multiple purchasers.
          Such non-rivalrous goods pose numerous intriguing economic questions,
          but one thing is entirely clear: non-rivalrous money is an
          impossibility. Without scarcity, or exclusive exchange, the very idea of
          monetary quantity loses all sense, as does monetary value, spending and
          investment, and consumer choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bitcoin algorithm makes a digital currency rivalrous, and thus
          effective as money, without recourse to any administrative authority. It
          does so by initiating an automatic or spontaneous ecology, in which
          computers on the network authenticate Bitcoin exchanges as a side-effect
          of ‘mining’ for new coins. Nodes earn new coins, at a diminishing rate,
          by solving a difficult
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_blank">digital puzzle</a>
          – accessible only to a brute force, computationally-intensive approach –
          and thus exhibiting
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system" target="_blank">proof-of-work</a>. This test
          screens
          the system from malicious interventions, by
          establishing a practically insurmountable barrier to any user who seeks
          to falsify the record of exchanges. Competent discussions can be found
          <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/06/virtual-currency" target="_blank">here</a>,

            target="_blank">here</a>, and (most diversely)
          <a href="http://www.quora.com/Bitcoin/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea%20http://forum.bitcoin.org/"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This problem, and solution, is very far from arbitrary. It is precisely
          because existing fiat currencies have taken on disturbingly
          non-rivalrous characteristics that alarm about currency debasement has
          reached such a pitch of exasperation. When a central bank, in the course
          of running a typically loose monetary policy, can simply speed up the
          printing presses or (still worse) the electronic equivalent, the
          integrity of the money supply is devastated at the root. Bitcoin
          rigorously extirpates such ruinous discretion from its system, by
          instantiating a theory of sound money as a precisely and publicly
          defined electronic experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin monetary aggregate is modeled on precious
          metal, generated by miners from a finite global reserve, with rising
          extraction costs. The reward for coin mining falls over time at a
          logarithmic (Zenonian) rate, towards a limit of fractionally under
          21,000,000 BTC. Each Bitcoin can be subdivided to eight decimal places,
          to a total of over two quadrillion (2,100,000,000,000,000) fragments,
          equivalent to 210,000 Bitcoin ‘quanta’ for each of the 10 billion people
          making up the earth’s anticipated climax human population. A Bitcoin
          quantum (0.00000001 BTC) is named a ‘Satoshi’ (after Satoshi Nakamoto),
          although amendment to the system allowing for further sub-division at
          some future stage is not foreclosed. (For the total size of the Bitcoin
          economy look
          <a href="http://blockexplorer.com/q/totalbc" target="_blank">here</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is programmed for deflation (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deflationary_spiral"
            target="_blank">of a
            sort</a>). This is a source of delight to hard money types, and of outrage to
          those in the loose money (inflationary) camp. As an experiment, the
          great merit of Bitcoin is to raise this antagonism beyond the level of
          reciprocal polemics, to that of potential historical evidence — and real
          choice. Austrolibertarians have long claimed that free money systems are
          biased to deflation, and that central banking encourages inflation as a
          surreptitious mechanism of economic expropriation, to ultimately
          disastrous effect. Keynesians, in contrast, deplore deflation as an
          economic disease that suppresses productive investment and employment.
          Empirical testing could soon be possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous other questions, theoretical and practical, present
          <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/casey/casey89.1.html" target="_blank">themselves</a>. At the practical level,
          such
          questions work themselves out through
          speculative volatility, institutional adaptations, and technical
          challenges. Since the entire Bitcoin economy remains very small,
          relatively modest shifts in economic behavior yield wild swings in BTC
          value, including
          <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/06/the-bitcoin-bubble.html"
            target="_blank">bubble-like</a>
          surges, precipitous collapses, incontinent
          <a href="http://launch.is/blog/l019-bitcoin-p2p-currency-the-most-dangerous-project-weve-ev.html"
            target="_blank">hype</a>, and
          <a href="http://www.hightechforum.org/bitcoins-a-crypto-geek-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank">extravagant</a>
          <a href="http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201105#08" target="_blank">accusations</a>. Despite the resilience of the
          core
          algorithm, the peripheral
          institutions supporting the Bitcoin economy remain
          <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2011/06/bitcoin-nightmare.html" target="_blank">vulnerable</a>
          to theft, fraud, and malicious interventions. As with any revolutionary
          experiment, the developmental trajectory of Bitcoin is likely to be
          tumultuous and highly unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theoretical questions can be entertained more calmly. The most
          important of these concern the essential nature of money, and its
          future. Does Bitcoin successfully simulate the significant features of
          precious metals, such that their substance can be discarded from the
          monetary equation as irrelevant dross? How powerful are the forces
          leading to monetary convergence? Will first-mover advantage ‘lock-in’
          Bitcoin at the expense of later alternatives? Or will multiple money
          systems – perhaps ever more heterogeneous ones – continue to co-exist?
          Is Bitcoin merely one stage in an open-ended sequence of innovative
          money systems, or does it capture the essential features of money quite
          definitively (leaving room only for incremental improvements, or
          tinkering)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Supporters of the monetary status quo might insist on a further, more
          derisive line of questioning: is Bitcoin a dead end, an irrelevance, or
          a deluding libertarian cipherpunk fantasy, to be judged eventually as
          something akin to a hoax? Which is to note that, ultimately, the largest
          questions will be political, and the most heated discussions already
          are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can governments afford to tolerate unmanaged, autonomous currencies?
          We’ll see.

          In an
          <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/01/08/bitcoin-internet-of-money/">article</a>
          that might be the most important contribution to the understanding of
          Bitcoin since its launch, Eli Dourado writes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>[Bitcoin] is a currency, of sorts. You can spend it on things,
            especially drugs and gambling and getting around capital controls.
            Krugman and other economists have analyzed Bitcoin in these terms, as
            a substitute for dollars. This is rather like regarding the Internet
            as a substitute for, and not a quantum leap beyond, previous
            communication technologies. It is true that Bitcoin can substitute for
            other currencies, but as with the Internet, the abstraction of a
            permissionless application layer means that it is
            <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/19/bitcoin-more-than-money/print">much more than a
              substitute</a>:
            it is like a transport layer for finance.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Every Bitcoin transaction is defined in part by a bit of code, called
            a script, written in a
            <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">programming language called Script</a>. The script in one
            transaction defines how the next user can access
            the coins. In a conventional transaction, the script specifies the
            hash of the public key that is needed to spend the coins next, and
            demands a signature from the corresponding private key.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Script is not limited, however, to these conventional transactions
            that merely transfer coins from one person’s control to another’s. It
            can evaluate statements, execute conditionally, do math, and move bits
            around. It is not a Turing-complete programming language (there is no
            looping), because that would be a security risk; we do not want
            viruses to spread via Bitcoin’s blockchain, nor do we want Bitcoin
            transactions to run indefinitely or, if we ever figure out AI, become
            self-aware. Despite the lack of loops in Script, it can be used to
            construct some very interesting scripts. …
          </em>

          Sometimes
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-idea-of-neoreaction/">ratchets</a>
          work right.
        </p>
        <p>
          ADDED: In the comments thread to the article, Eli Dourado suggests:
          “It’s … possible that democracies won’t respond effectively against
          Bitcoin because they don’t respond effectively to much of anything.”

          Kevin D Williamson writes one of the best
          <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/372372/kudlow-vs-bitcoin-kevin-d-williamson">pieces</a>
          yet on Bitcoin:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To argue that bitcoins are not “real money” because they have no
            central-bank regulation or central issuer is like arguing that a
            prepaid disposable cell phone is not a “real phone” because its number
            doesn’t appear in the directory and you don’t get a bill. That’s the
            point, or at least part of the point.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I am skeptical of the Bitcoin model, but it has in no small part been
            a victim of its own popularity, with speculative investments in
            bitcoins overwhelming their use in commercial transactions. But this
            phenomenon is not unknown among traditional currencies. Consider the
            lengths to which the Swiss have had to go in recent years to stabilize
            the value of the franc as euros (and, to a lesser extent, dollars)
            bounced about.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But that misses the broader point in a couple of ways. The first is
            that bitcoins and other private currencies are intended as
            replacements for greenbacks in approximately the same way that the
            Internet was intended to be a replacement for the printing press: They
            may do that, sure, but they will have other uses as well. Wresting
            control of currencies away from politicians is the only way to let
            money evolve. Twenty years ago, you didn’t know that you’d want to
            take photos with your telephone or use it as a boarding pass at the
            airport. Now you do. Nobody planned that. Nobody knows what “real
            money” is going to mean in twenty years.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-2199"></span><em>As for price instability, that is of course a fundamental issue, and
            … the fact that most of the world’s governments have made counterfeit
            currency (which is what fiat money is) legal tender complicates the
            environment. … A financial asset may decline in value; a U.S. dollar
            is practically guaranteed to, if history is any guide. Very
            wealthy people and institutions already have access to de facto
            private money in the form of various financial instruments; private
            currencies promise to make similar benefits available to general
            consumers — and, critically, to move that market beyond the reach of
            central bankers and regulators, and probably tax-collectors, too, in
            the long run.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>We can probably expect a robust, competitive market in private
            currencies to develop, and Bitcoin may or may not be a part of the
            long-term picture. It may turn out to be the Packard of private
            currencies. We’ll know the market has arrived when people have as many
            choices of currency provider as they do of cell-phone provider. And
            that will be a critical moment in the shifting balance of power
            between politics and markets, another way for us to stop
            <strong>asking permission </strong>to engage in commerce.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>This is in part why I object to … the
            <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong>’s characterization of the natural
            theater for bitcoin use as “the black market.” A better phrase for
            “the black market”  is “the market.”

          After reading this stuff, it’s easy to think that the only meaningful
          role for anything else on the right is to run interference while
          ‘Bitcoin’ (i.e. a-centric digital crypto-commerce) consummates the
          destiny of capitalism. The intelligence gulf between the emerging
          Bitcoin machinery and legacy political controversy now yawns so
          abysmally that inherited conceptions of ‘activism’ have become low
          comedy. Poke at Bitcoin with a political stick and it slithers sideways
          while turning more feral — the ‘instinct’ for that is already locked in.
          The confused idiots who are trying to manage human societies today will
          almost certainly make it into a monster. Since I don’t like them very
          much, it doesn’t upset me to see it stealthing into the shadows, with
          venomous claws emerging. It will be darkly amusing to see it coming at
          them out of Hell.

          <h4 class="post-title">Bitcoin Backend</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          A short photo-heavy
          <a href="http://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/08/bitcoin/inside-chinese-bitcoin-mine/">story</a>
          by ‘Bitsmith’ explores the engine-room behind digital cryptocurrency,
          where Chinese ‘miners’ run banks of computers to fetch new monetary
          units out of mathematical abstraction. The incentives for the mining
          operation are straightforward, and economically indistinguishable from
          those driving mineral mining operations. Due to the genius of the
          Bitcoin design, this massive computational effort serves, automatically,
          to secure the integrity of the system against subversion. What offers
          opportunities for extractive wild-catting from the entrepreneurial side,
          is a decentralized trust mechanism from that of the currency exchange
          network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Located in a re-purposed industrial space, the mining operation’s 2,500
          machines perform a total 600 trillion operations per second, consuming
          RMB 400,000 of electricity per month. There’s an attached audio file
          with the story, so you can listen in on the process. It’s not pretty,
          but it sounds unmistakably serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tone of Bitsmith’s prose has been peeled straight off the
          cryptocurrency frontier, which makes it doubly informative. This is the
          object and the spirit of capitalist perception in the early 21st
          century:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Getting the opportunity to visit this mining operation was very
            eye-opening for me. Walking around the warehouse floor, I was struck
            with a feeling of awe that THIS is what keeps bitcoin alive. That even
            if someone wanted to bring down bitcoin, they’d have to outdo these
            guys and the dozens of other operations like this around the world.
            The decentralized nature of it all … that this is just one operation
            among many, run by different operators in different countries around
            the world. This really drove home that bitcoin can’t be killed by
            decree. Make it illegal in one country and people like this will keep
            hashing away in others.</em>
        </p>
        <em>
          <p>
            This is a far cry from the small-time home miners of the
            not-too-distant past. Not even two years ago I knew a guy mining tons
            of coins per day with just a couple dozen GPU units in his bedroom.
          </p>
        </em>
        <p>
          <em>The other feeling I got while there is that this is kind of a
            libertarian fantasy for many. These guys are performing a valuable
            service and getting paid well for it. Too many in the world get paid
            well at the expense of others, or dedicate their lives to giving back
            to society without a penny in return, but mining farms like these are
            participating in the economy in a purely capitalist way (and the good
            kind of capitalism, not
            “socialism-for-banks-but-we’ll-call-it-capitalism-anyways”).</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Love it or loathe it, the future that has already begun to arrive. This
          is an inspection tour not to be missed.

          A US$80 million bitcoin

            href="https://blockchain.info/tx/8f1d3a8ef6b2d4a25d2f499279e01518b4770819ccbc39a765c4c326170c61b3">transaction</a>
          is impressive. To really get a sense of the momentum behind the
          impending blockchained Internet, however, a figure like this pales
          beside the cultural groundswell. Bitcoin consolidates its inevitability
          from the sheer social heterogeneity it coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watch
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfOCqgS8gs">this</a> video
          alongside
          <a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/introducing-the-winklevoss-capital-syndicate-on-angellist/">this</a>
          venture capital announcement. It would be over-dramatic to suggest these
          people want to kill each other, but there’s every reason to suspect they
          would not be excessively traumatized by bad things happening to each
          other. There’s no commonality of social perspective, no grounds for
          reciprocal sympathy, and a massive accumulation of historical distrust.
          Yet Famous Amos and the Winklevoss twins are cooperating, spontaneously,
          in the same world-historic undertaking. If there’s any plane short of
          the blockchain that could imaginably facilitate comparable coordination
          between otherwise-noncommunicating constituencies, I’ve no idea what it
          could be. (‘The market’? — merely blockchain commerce in embryo.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The guiding principle of the next Kondratiev upswing is the
          <em>trustless commonwealth</em>. It doesn’t expect us to like each
          other. That’s why it’s going to win.

          <h4 class="post-title">On the Table</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Pierre Rochard’s
          <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-bitcoin-central-banks-perfect-monetary-policy/">essay</a>
          on ‘The Bitcoin Central Bank’s Perfect Monetary Policy’ presents an
          impressively cogent case for the superiority of Bitcoin over not only
          slimy government fiat scrip (boo hiss), but even over precious metals.
          One table, in particular, deserves to be committed to heart by anyone
          making systematic three-way comparisons:
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/transactioncosts-e1418786921411.jpg"><img

              width="666" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s difficult to run through this and see anything less than a
          fundamental rupture in social history. When compared to Bitcoin, only
          proto-money has ever yet existed.
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-1476"></span>As Rochard concludes:</p>
        <p>
          <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking">Fractional reserve banking</a>
            entails the creation of new money that is fungible with already
            preexisting money, i.e. it can be used interchangeably within the
            currency’s payment systems. This is impossible with Bitcoin. The BCB
            [‘Bitcoin Central Bank’] enforces the strictest deposit regulations in
            the world by requiring
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking">full reserves</a>
            for all accounts. This is the digital equivalent of the
            <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12202.pdf">Chicago Plan</a>
            or the
            <a href="http://mises.org/library/case-100-percent-gold-dollar-0">Austrian 100% reserve gold standard</a>.
            Under
            this regulatory regime, money is not destroyed when bank
            debts are repaid, so increased money hoarding does not cause
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap">liquidity traps</a>, instead it increases real
            interest
            rates and lowers consumer
            prices. This is a self-stabilizing cycle as higher interest rates
            incentivize hoarders to invest, while deflation increases consumption
            due to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_effect">wealth-effect</a>
            on hoarders. The BCB prevents lending out of deposits so that it can
            properly target money supply and avoid the destabilizing effects of
            commingling the credit and payment systems.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>The positive properties of AMST [‘asymptotic money supply targeting’]
            and PoWS [‘Proof-of-work seigniorage’] combined make it certain that,
            absent a technological problem, Bitcoin will be adopted as the global
            currency. For a deeper understanding of the market process involved in
            becoming global currency I would recommend reading Konrad Graf’s

        <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/bitcoin-as-soci/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Bitcoin as SOCI</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/deep-code/lets-get-this-straight-bitcoin-is-an-experiment-in-self-organizing-collective-intelligence-52d78212c5e6#.h1z1zo2qd">This</a>
          is one of the greatest things ever written, period.
        </p>
        <p>‘SOCI’ abbreviates ‘self-organizing collective intelligence’.</p>
        <p>
          <em>The basic dynamics of a SOCI is as follows. It begins as some sort of
            attractor — some aesthetic sensibility or yearning — that is able to
            grab the attention and energy of some group of people. Generally one
            that is very vague and abstract. Some idea or notion that only makes
            sense to a relatively small group. […] But, and this is the key move,
            when those people apply their attention and energy to the SOCI, this
            makes it more real, easier for more people to grasp and to find
            interesting and valuable. Therefore, more attractive to more people
            and their attention and energy. […] … If the SOCI has enough capacity
            within its collective intelligence to resolve the challenge, it
            “levels up” and expands its ability to attract more attention and
            energy. If not, then it becomes somewhat bounded (at least for the
            present) and begins to find the limit of “what it is”.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Greenhal then narrates the story of Bitcoin to date, within this
          framework. The sheer enormity of the innovation it has introduced
          emerges starkly.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion:</p>
        <p>
          <em>My sense is that over just the next five years this new form of SOCI
            will go through its gestation, birthing and childhood development
            stages. The result will be a form of collective intelligence that is
            so much more capable than anything in the current environment that it
            will sweep away even the most powerful contemporary collective
            intelligences (in particular both corporations and nation states) in
            establishing itself as the new dominant form of collective
            intelligence on the Earth. […] And whoever gets there first will “win”
            in a fashion that is rarely seen in history.</em>
        </p>
        <p>This will look prophetic not too far down the road.</p>

          (as usual).
        </p>
        <p>
          The question is this: Which dominates? The malignancy of Leviathan, or
          its incompetence? How radically can the metastatic cancer-phase State
          shape reality in conformity to its vision?
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin — which is essentially an experiment in Austrian monetary theory
          — provides the model test-bed in which this question can be lucidly
          decided. Its current
          <a

          only accelerates the decision. If Bitcoin can’t be stopped, Leviathan is
          exposed as a paper tiger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to make the bet, of course, is to buy (or short) BTC.
          <em>Outside in</em> has been too apathetic to put resources behind its
          hunches yet, but (for the zilch it’s worth) our intuitions run
          <em>contra</em> Moldbug on the topic. Compared to Cyberspace, where
          bitcoin is entrenched, the State is weak, unintelligent, uninformed,
          parochial, poorly designed, and — in each respect — getting ever more
          so, in both comparative and absolute terms. The truly stupendous idiocy
          of Leviathan thoroughly swamps its evil, as is demonstrated every time
          it tries to get something done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital Outside, in contrast, is already far beyond recall. The germ
          of a free economy is under construction.

          <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.ca/2013/01/how-bitcoin-dies.html">ventures</a>, perhaps
          sometime
          this year. Following a broad DOJ indictment for
          money laundering, targeting any and everybody remotely connected with
          the free currency, the “BTC/USD price falls to 0 and remains there.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “[R]emains there” — how cute is that?
          <em>Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Bitcoin R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin simulates gold, and once ‘mined’ it lasts for ever. If it “falls
          to 0” it has to remain there, for eternity, because it can never be
          finished. It can die, but never be destroyed. It’s built for undeath.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Moldbug Monetary Theory’ attributes the value of money exclusively to
          speculation. If the speculators are terrorized sufficiently, BTC drops
          onto the flatline, and “remains there.” The market would be totally
          extinguished. What Mao failed to achieve, let alone sustain, USG would
          somehow accomplish, perhaps by exhibiting greater revolutionary ardor
          and ruthlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruthlessness would certainly be necessary, for the obvious reason that
          flatline-BTC has zero downside risk. It’s a one-way bet that someone,
          somewhere, will re-animate it (“<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/big-bang-an-appreciation/">nothing is
            unstable</a>” (thanks to <em>fotrkd</em> for the reminder)). If a genius was
          designing irresistible speculator-bait, zero-degree bitcoin would be
          hard to improve upon. It’s free, and it’s only worth nothing if the cops
          can secure the crypt flawlessly, and <em>forever</em>. Did anyone say
          ‘free money’?

        <p>
          Speculation messes with time, by bringing the future forward. If undead
          BTC were <em>ever</em> to be re-awakened, it already has been. Its
          economic potential flows back down the timeline, modified by a
          time-preference discount. The feedback becomes strange, and difficult to
          confidently calculate, but it works as a vitalizing charge, and the
          corpse unmistakably twitches. Whatever money at t0 is worth, if it’s
          anything at all, at t0-<em>n</em> it almost certainly can’t be zero.

          <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-bitcoin-dies.html">prophecy</a>. The target
          acquisition revealed in
          <em>Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency</em>, section
          <em>c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies</em> could not possibly be
          clearer:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A final type of convertible virtual currency activity involves a
            de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central
            repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may
            obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and
          uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the
          convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money
          transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible
          virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real
          currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another
          location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an
          exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such
          de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and
          transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of
          currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.

            think</a>
          Moldbug confirms:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I have not of course seen the questionnaire [for money transmitter
            licenses], but I imagine it asks you how you know the monies you’re
            transmitting are not the product of illegal activity. Of course,
            Bitcoin provides no such assurance. By design. That’s because it’s
            well-designed — for a free country that doesn’t exist.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          With licenses unobtainable, and unlicensed monetary transactions
          proscribed, Bitcoin price-discovery has been criminalized. The
          conclusion: Bitcoin no longer has a practically meaningful US$ exchange
          rate, which is equivalent, in fact, to having a yet undiscovered (but
          already implicit) value of US$0. The cliff edge has been crossed, and
          all that remains is the impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empirically vulnerable predictions are pure gold, and this is an
          especially precious example. The fate of Bitcoin tests the real power of
          the State, the practicability of economic controls, and all political
          theories — whether reactionary or progressive — which subordinate market
          dynamics to more fundamental levels of social order. If Bitcoin does
          soon die, it will have been demonstrated that government can effectively
          dominate the economic sphere, dictate price, and eradicate commerce,
          under conditions which are — in at least some important respects —
          extremely challenging. Freedom might still seem attractive, but it will
          have been shown to be puny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if Bitcoin survives, and spreads, the Right’s libertarian
          current will be vitalized.

          insubordination of markets will have been dramatically evidenced, the
          State humiliated and weakened, and an archetypal anarcho-capitalist
          institution entrenched. Interesting times.

          <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2013/03/20/the-war-on-bitcoin-and-anonymity/">argues</a>
          that anonymity is the “real target”:<br />
          <em>Contrary to some popular accounts, Bitcoin is not completely
            anonymous, but pseudonymous. The entire Bitcoin ledger is publicly
            shared so that the same coins can’t be spent twice. Bitcoin “mixers”
            take coins from multiple pseudonymous actors, shuffle them around, and
            return them to their original users under new pseudonyms. In other
            words, mixers help anonymize a system that is not truly anonymous.<br />
            If the government were to succeed in regulating mixers, it would not
            destroy Bitcoin as a payment mechanism or even hurt Bitcoin’s price,
            which has now reached an all-time high of $60, but it would ruin one
            of the chief advantages of using it—the quasi-anonymity that it
            affords.</em>

          prophetically:

            Bitcoins. On Tuesday, Dwolla announced that it had frozen Mt. Gox’s
            account at the request of federal investigators. It’s the first
            federal action against the currency.

        </p>
        <p>And, by the way:</p>
        <p>

          share Moldbug’s BTC prediction, but the projected narratives don’t
          diverge much for some time. By attempting to stamp out Bitcoin, USG
          rapidly converts it into an overtly subversive
          <em>revolutionary currency</em>*, used only by those in explicit (though
          covert) antagonism to the regnant global economic regime. The test then
          begins.

        <p>
          *Typically, reactionaries don’t like revolutions, but that’s because
          revolutions are typically democratizing. When the neoreaction gets to
          watch a spontaneous right-wing revolution unfolding,

          they’ll quickly recover their natural sympathy for it.

          <h4 class="post-title">Will Bitcoin Survive?</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Eli Dourado, author of the most important Bitcoin-inspired
          <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/01/08/bitcoin-internet-of-money/">article</a>
          on the web, remains publicly committed to the cryptocurrency’s future.
          In the wake of the <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/">Mt Gox</a>
          <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=485721.0">crisis</a>,
          affecting the world’s largest BTC exchange (based in Japan), he has
          written a brief
          <a href="http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-struggles/">defense</a> of
          the bullish case in Nietzschean vein:
          <em>what does not kill us makes us stronger</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In just four short paragraphs, Dourado manages to make a significant
          point. Stress-tested survival has a value. The more ferocious Bitcoin’s
          environment is shown to be, the more advantageous its competitive
          position relative to alternative cryptocurrencies, as its resilience is
          demonstrated and publicized. Actualization of potential (catastrophe)
          resolves risk, leaving whatever survives augmented by a security
          premium. “Now it turns out that getting a cryptocurrency ecosystem to
          grow up is really, really hard — harder than maybe we thought. It
          follows directly that Bitcoin faces less competition from other
          cryptocurrencies than we thought. … since it is hard to succeed, if
          Bitcoin succeeds, then it may be worth quite a lot.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-287"></span>Dourado’s two links do more work still. The
          <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-02-25/mt-gox-meltdown-spells-doom-for-bitcoin">first</a>
          is to a recent Megan McArdle pre-obituary on BTC, which argues that the
          reputational damage inflicted by the Mt Gox fiasco will weaken it still
          further in what was always a Quixotic challenge to State power:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I’ve never been very bullish on Bitcoin, because ultimately, the
            better it performs at evading government surveillance of currency
            transactions (and government ability to manage debt loads via
            inflation), the harder those governments are going to try to shut it
            down.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments like levying an invisible inflation tax, and get angry when
          people attempt to route around it. (This is all quite explicit, on
          <a href="krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/bitcoin-is-evil/‎">both</a>
          <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2014/01/15/bitcoin-revolution">sides</a>.) The balance of opportunities
          within
          this conflict is too intricate
          to detail here, but McArdle’s utter submissiveness to government
          exaction clearly represents an extreme position among commentators. That
          Bitcoin predictably infuriates state financial authorities is a feature,
          not a bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dourado’s
          <a
            href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/12/how-and-why-bitcoin-will-plummet-in-price.html">second</a>
          link refers to an older and subtler argument by Tyler Cowen, which makes
          a bearish case against Bitcoin on strictly economic grounds. Insofar as
          Bitcoin is seen to flourish, competitor cryptocurrencies will be
          attracted into the market, arbitraging value down to the cost of supply:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There is thus a new theorem: the value of [any -it]Coin should, in
            equilibrium, be equal to the marketing costs of its potential
            competitors … In short, we are still in a situation where supply-side
            arbitrage has not worked its way through the value of Bitcoin. And
            that is one reason —
            <a
              href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/china-and-the-soaring-price-of-bitcoin.html">among
              others</a>
            — why I expect the value of Bitcoin to fall — a lot.</em>
          [Cowen’s internal link is well worth following up.]
        </p>
        <p>
          As already noted, Cowen’s bearish position is <em>weakened</em> by
          Bitcoin’s recent travails. Almost irrespective of what happens next, an
          established reputation for toughness will feature prominently in the
          market evaluation of any cryptocurrency from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Bitcoin won’t have been killed — it is close to impossible to kill
          — it will have been made much stronger.

          all with respect to Bitcoin is the extent to which it can reform itself
          to work inside Bitcoin.” OK, it’s perhaps an over-stretch in the
          opposite direction, but it still ends up far closer to the mark.

          a tumble, Heather R Morgan reminds us of her super-bearish
          <a href="http://econgoat.com/a-lesson-in-economics-for-engineers">article</a>

          <em>While the price of bitcoin is down 9% year-to-date, if you look below
            the surface it is clear that Bitcoin had a strong first half and is
            making great strides as digital money for people around the world and
            a payment network for innovation. … […] The number of transactions per
            day on the Bitcoin network is rapidly accelerating. The network
            averaged 60,590 transactions per day in June 2014 and 117,474
            transactions per day in June 2015. … That’s a
            <strong>94% increase in monthly transactions over the past year</strong>.</em><br />
          [Emphasis in original.]
        </p>
        <p>
          One obvious hypothesis — that Bitcoin hoarders are strategically
          restraining their holdings in order to facilitate the commercial spread
          of the currency — seems to assume an implausibly coherent solution to an
          intractable coordination (or collective action) problem. A more widely
          accepted Bitcoin has to be worth more, doesn’t it? It’s hard to see how
          <em>everyone</em> could be leaving that value on the pavement. (This
          blog is presently stumped.)

          <h4 class="post-title">Bitcoin and Chains</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Doug Henwood, writing in <em>The Nation</em>,
          <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/179620/bitcoin-future-money#">explains</a>
          the attractions of Bitcoin for the Right:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There have been many other reports of thefts, frauds and hackings,
            which Bitcoin partisans dismiss as mere growing pains. But with no
            regulator, no deposit insurance and no central bank, this sort of
            thing is inevitable — it’s just tough luck. Introduce regulators and
            insurance schemes, though, and Bitcoin will lose all its
            anarcho-charm.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>Keynes once called gold “part of the apparatus of conservatism” for
            its appeal to rentiers who loved austerity because it preserved the
            value of their assets. Bitcoin serves a similarly totemic purpose for
            today’s cyber-libertarians, who love not only the statelessness of it
            as money, but also its power to subject the institutional banking
            system to “disruption” (one of the favorite words of that set). And
            like gold, Bitcoin is deflationary. There’s a limit on how many
            bitcoins can be produced, and it gets more difficult to produce them
            over time until that limit is reached. Of course, new cryptocurrencies
            could arise. But the existence of the limit reflects the deflationary
            sympathies of the libertarian mind — in a Bitcoin economy, creating
            money to ease an economic depression would be impossible. Which is not
            to say that only libertarians love Bitcoin.</em>
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-537"></span></p>
        <p>
          Despite the careful signals of political distance, there’s nothing
          off-track on the substance. In the subsequent paragraphs Henwood
          excavates a little deeper, while preserving the same balanced openness
          to information. He even — momentarily — passes the ultimate Rightist
          clue-test by collapsing epistemology down into the market: “Bitcoin is
          not without friends on Wall Street. Gil Luria of Wedbush Securities is
          following it; he describes the recent volatility as ‘extended price
          discovery,’ which is a way of saying that no one knows what it is, what
          it will be or what it’s worth. His firm is selling his Bitcoin research
          for payment in bitcoins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          His unexpected discovery, however, is a Left Bitcoin constituency, drawn
          to it by the same priorities that can make ‘libertarianism’ so
          ideologically-slippery as a category, most obviously: the potential for
          “evasion of state surveillance and policing — which, in the post-Snowden
          era, is nothing to sneeze at.” While rummaging for story-snippets at a
          New York Bitcoin ‘party’, he is delighted to run into ‘Mistress Magpie’:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A Marxist-feminist professional dominatrix who practices in Britain …
            [and] an enthusiastic Bitcoin proponent. She explains her enthusiasm
            as beginning with her deep techno-geekiness, and adds that Bitcoin is
            also practical for someone in her line of work — anonymity is
            important, whether operating in real life or online. Unlike
            libertarians, who see cryptocurrencies as a possible gateway to a new
            society, the socialist in Mistress Magpie sees them as a way to
            operate furtively under capitalism, in a way that might not be needed
            in a more open socialist society.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          While it’s superficially tempting to make fun of such socialism with
          anarcho-capitalist characteristics, it sparkles in comparison to the
          dismal defense of state fiat money authority with which Henwood —
          dutifully — concludes the article.

          Writing in <em>E-International Relations</em>, Brett Scott
          <a
            href="http://www.e-ir.info/2014/06/01/visions-of-a-techno-leviathan-the-politics-of-the-bitcoin-blockchain/">raises</a>
          Left critique of the blockchain revolution to a stimulating level of
          theoretical sophistication. His central argument is important:
          Blockchain cryptosystems are the technological realization of the
          “dystopian, conservative” impulse — first crystallized by Thomas Hobbes
          — to establish a politically-immunized sovereignty. This social model,
          previously subverted by the fallible humanity of leaders, is finally
          becoming attainable as algorithmic government, Scott’s
          <em>Techno-Leviathan</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Conservative libertarians hold tight to the belief that, if only hard
            property rights and clear contracting rules are put in place, optimal
            systems spontaneously emerge. They are not actually that far from
            Hobbes in this regard, but their irritation with Hobbes’ vision is
            that it relies on politicians who, being actual people, do not act
            like a detached contractual Sovereign should, but rather attempt to
            meddle, make things better, or steal. Don’t decentralised blockchains
            offer the ultimate prospect of protected property rights with clear
            rules, but without the political interference?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Scott navigates the Ideological Turing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_Turing_Test">Test</a>
          well enough to become a landmark reference in future discussions. His
          opponents will no doubt in many cases concede (as this blog does) that
          the ‘dystopia’ he describes, while portrayed in ominous and mournful
          tones, captures the attachments — and dis-attachments — of zealous
          blockchain promoters remarkably well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scott clearly thinks political trust is a social good that can be
          re-built or recovered (perhaps by restarting
          <a href="http://restartdemocracy.org/">democracy</a>). Even if this is
          so, the time remaining for the salvage operation is running out fast.

          The point it raises is going to fuel an important argument, down the
          road. Better to explore it via an appropriately constructed altcoin, and
          in the market, though, than to wreck Bitcoin in the course of the
          dialectic. Hard money philosophy is baked into the Bitcoin protocol. If
          that doesn’t seem like a good idea, the solution is to try something
          else.

          through January, the all-consuming chaos of 2016 has

          over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bitcoin block-size spat that rumbled inconclusively throughout the
          previous year has escalated into a dramatic public row, with core
          developer Mike Hearn’s
          <a
            href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.51ydmmac0">noisy</a>
          exit. His text is an instant classic for the historical record,
          regardless of how persuasive its argument is found. The
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40zq07/mike_hearn_i_will_no_longer_be_taking_part_in/">discussion</a>
          at <em>Reddit</em> provides some sense of the controversy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearn is writing Bitcoin off as a “failed experiment” — which seems
          histrionic, despite the many points of interest he raises. The deep
          tension between its security principles and its (near-term) growth
          prospects is a matter of evident seriousness. Taking the monkey business
          out of money innovation won’t be as easy as some of the
          crypto-currency’s more optimistic proponents had anticipated. Something
          of extreme historical radicality is occurring, and it’s going to be
          messy.
        </p>
        <p>
          With much of the world going under in 2016, there’s likely to be a
          scramble for the escape capsule — and that seems to be on fire.

          In my eternally on-the-way Bitcoin book, the point is raised like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>While the governmental response to Bitcoin is doubtless guided by a
            strategy (or in fact multiple strategies) of capture, this does not
            reduce to an agenda of public regulation, still less suppression, but
            also includes cooptation in accordance with deep state functions, as
            well as the private interests of state agents. Insofar as every real
            state includes a ‘deep’ or sub-public aspect, it will inevitably
            relate ambiguously to the emergence of elusive social capabilities,
            although this ambiguity will be only minimally reflected in its public
            relations. The empowering of private agents to evade state scrutiny
            and regulation represents a manifest erosion of government or ‘public’
            authority, and is liable to be denounced on those grounds (if not
            transparently in those terms). Yet the crypto-secure transaction
            systems responsible for such governance complications are also
            opportunities for covert action, and are therefore to be counted as
            virtual assets. The novel functions introduced by Bitcoin tend to the
            exacerbation – or sophistication – of agency problems.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The politics of Bitcoin can be expected, eventually, to catalyze a
            multitude of obscure metamorphoses in the nature of the state. If the
            distinct but overlapping occult fields of clandestine security
            functions and resilient sub-public interests are bundled into a
            provisional concept of the dark state, it can be quite confidently
            predicted that the balance of attraction and repulsion between such
            elements and crypto-currency will be highly asymmetric with respect to
            public communication. As a corollary, it is realistic to assume that
            the openly stated position of public authorities in regards to
            crypto-channels of all kinds, very much including Bitcoin, will be
            systematically misleading, in a negative direction. Bitcoin tends to
            empower the invisible, and to disempower the visible.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          An event on the cryptic plane is not to be confused with its public
          presentation. Even if the NSA did not create Bitcoin (and — like Clark —
          I seriously doubt that it did), it’s unlikely that it would be
          distraught about the discreet rumor that it had.

          ideological mish-mash which has been worked-over by PR imperatives and
          demands cold scrutiny to extract its real content.
        </p>
        <p>From the whitepaper:</p>
        <p>
          <em>A word of caution, at the outset: the legal status of DAOs remains
            the subject of active and vigorous debate and discussion. Not everyone
            shares the same definition. Some have said that they are autonomous
            code and can operate independently of legal systems; others have said
            that they must be owned or operate by humans or human created
            entities. There will be many uses cases, and the DAO code will develop
            over time. Ultimately, how a DAO functions and its legal status will
            depend on many factors, including how DAO code is used, where it is
            used, and who uses it. This paper does not speculate about the legal
            status of DAOs worldwide.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The XS prediction is itself predictable:
          <em>This only goes in one direction</em> (and eventually its going to be
          vast).

          <em>According to Kim Dotcom, the key to a safer, more secure and
            decentralized Internet will lie within blockchain technology, or a
            version of Bitcoin’s original concept. He has spent two years working
            on the program, and basically turning the Internet into a encrypted,
            decentralized smartphone app. In general terms, here’s how it works:
            […] “If you have 100 million smartphones that have the MegaNet app
            installed, we’ll have more online storage capacity, bandwidth and
            calculating power than the top 10 largest websites in the world
            combined,” Dotcom claims. “Over the years with these new devices and
            capacity, especially mobile bandwidth capacity, there will be no
            limitations. We are going to use very long keys, systems that will not
            be reverse engineered or cracked by any supercomputer. […] … Dotcom
            says it will use a faster version of
            <a

            initially as a “dumb pipe” to get the ball rolling. He and his staff
            are working on a new type of encryption that will work regardless of
            how MegaNet is accessed. Bandwidth would come from Wi-Fi use and when
            the phone is idle, so no charges would come through an IP.</em>

          <em>Marketplaces and currencies tend to go well together. Paypal famously
            got to scale by becoming the currency of choice for eBay buyers and
            sellers. The US dollar grew to its current international predominance
            in part on the back of the large, integrated US market. And it thus
            stands to reason that a digital currency like Bitcoin might be well
            suited for a digital marketplace based on Bitcoin. […] But the exact
            nature of the products being sold in such a marketplace is important.
            Unlike a traditional physical market localized to a nation state, the
            digital currency community is dispersed around the world. Moreover,
            most users hold relatively small balances, especially relative to
            their reserves of fiat currency. Finally, the community has a
            disproportionate share of engineers and computer scientists relative
            to the general world population. […] Taking these constraints into
            account, we’ve built what we think of as the first
            <strong>micropayments marketplace</strong>: a marketplace that allows
            buyers and sellers to trade in digital goods using micropayments,
            initially specifically focused on APIs for developer use.</em>

        <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/bitcoin-on-the-silk-road/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Bitcoin on the Silk Road</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          A series of professional writing obligations have taken me to Xinjiang
          three times this year, and the single strongest impression from these
          trips has been the centrality of Silk Road heritage. Regardless of
          borders, ethnicities, and controversies, the Silk Road is the reason
          everyone is there, and the thing that has always come first.
          Derivatively, transport infrastructure connects settlements together,
          but primarily it is the great ancient thoroughfare that has deposited
          areas of habitation along its vast — and harsh — middle stretches, as if
          provisioning itself with the archaic equivalent of gas stations and
          traffic police outposts, distributed in whatever frequency necessary to
          hold open the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          China is not very adept at international PR, and Xinjiang coverage in
          world media tends to be critical. This has resulted in a predictable
          touchiness, and even though the most cursory historical examination
          already shows that Han Chinese have a profound ancient presence in the
          area, no opportunity is missed to underscore this point still further.
          These efforts range from the genuinely illuminating to the comically
          incompetent. One especially interesting species of evidence, falling
          somewhere between these extremes — and passing between them at an odd
          angle — is coinage. Repeatedly I was told by museum curators and
          historical experts, always with the greatest earnestness, that the
          abundance of Imperial Chinese currency found in the area was an
          unambiguous indicator of demographic integrity and Han settlement.
          Certainly, Xinjiang is a numismatist’s paradise, even if these tangible
          commercial signs are dragged into stories they cannot confidently tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-135"></span>Coins have little affinity with settlement.
          ‘Portability’ is always counted among the essential features demanded of
          money, because its function is to circulate, or travel. Like droplets
          swept along by the currents of commerce, the coins of Xinjiang belong to
          the road before they belong to the place, eloquent about transactions,
          but mute about territories. They tell of flows, and passages, but when
          the topic turns to political geography, they fall dumb. What does
          commercial traffic care for boundaries and homelands? — Only what it is
          coerced into caring about, whether by toll barriers, or by uncontrolled
          bandits.
        </p>
        <p>
          China was drawn into its Far West, well over two millennia ago, as the
          guardian of the Silk Road. It was legitimated as regional hegemon by its
          administrative capability and cultural cohesion. Apparently, in the
          present age of ethno-nationalist border squabbling and territorial
          irritability, recognizing this indisputable fact is either too much, or
          not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until recently, Bitcoin was associated with a different
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_%28marketplace%29">Silk Road</a>
          — although arguably not a <em>very</em> different one. As a
          partially-anonymized cryptocurrency, fundamentally immunized against
          political interference of any kind, it was naturally affiliated with the
          anarcho-capitalist markets of the ‘dark web’. The closure of this
          Internet Silk Road in early October propelled Bitcoin into a new phase
          of existence, as <em>Tech Crunch</em>
          <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/22/bitcoin-breaks-200-again/">explains</a>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bitcoin’s recent price surge also comes after a
            <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/bitcoin-falls-15-following-fbis-silk-road-seizure/">15% drop last
              month</a>, following the
            <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/02/bitcoin-falls-15-following-fbis-silk-road-seizure/">FBI
              seizure</a>
            of the underground ‘black market’ marketplace Silk Road — where
            billions worth in Bitcoin had been used to purchase various illegal
            goods and services since Silk Road was set up. The closure of the
            service blew a hole in Bitcoin’s valuation — but clearly only a
            temporary one. Bitcoin quickly recovered the lost value, and has since
            gone on this latest surge.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The removal of one of the most notorious pipelines linking Bitcoin to
            the buying and selling of narcotics and other illegal goods and
            services may actually have helped the cryptocurrency — by improving
            its reputation and thereby boosting its mainstream appeal.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Bitcoin supports near-anonymous transactions, which encouraged its
            use on Silk Road. But the cryptocurrency has many other
            characteristics that potentially make it interesting to a much more
            mainstream user-base — such as the fact transactions are irreversible,
            something of potential interest to online retailers wanting to avoid
            the hassle of chargebacks.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          With the artificial Silk Road shuttered, Bitcoin was quickly plugged
          into the original. Less than two weeks after the FBI operation, China’s
          Internet giant
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu">Baidu</a> announced that it
          would begin to
          <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/chinese-internet-giant-baidu-starts-accepting-bitcoin/">accept</a>
          Bitcoins. Whilst an obvious threshold event, this decision was also the
          confirmation of powerful pre-existing trends, which had raised the level
          of Chinese interest in the currency to the second highest in the world
          (after only the United States). For Chinese savers, trapped between
          negative real return RMB bank accounts and irrationally exuberant real
          estate markets, the prospects of Bitcoin as a speculative store of value
          can easily seem attractive. (A parallel rise in both private and public
          <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-10-21/guest-post-china-and-gold">gold</a>
          holdings reinforces this impression.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The most radical interpretation of these developments, however, would
          connect them to
          <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/World/WOR-02-151013.html">intimations</a>
          of a “de-Americanized world”. For American Bitcoin users, in particular,
          the currency is already embraced as a way to short the US dollar, and to
          practically express disgust at the global fiat money regime. Mere days
          before the <em>Baidu</em> decision, a
          <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2013-10/13/c_132794246.htm">commentary</a>
          on Xinhuanet  suggested:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What may also be included as a key part of an effective [global
            financial] reform is the introduction of a new international reserve
            currency that is to be created to replace the dominant U.S. dollar, so
            that the international community could permanently stay away from the
            spillover of the intensifying domestic political turmoil in the United
            States.</em>

          … there are no doubt a number. One that stands out for its conceptual
          clarity, however, is the
          <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/mm_sc_03.htm">Triffin</a>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma">Dilemma</a>.
          Formulated by Robert Triffin and publicized in testimony to the US
          Congress in 1960, it builds upon the simple arithmetical necessity that
          any country whose currency is privileged with world reserve status is
          compelled to run chronic trade deficits, in order to supply global
          monetary liquidity. World economic hegemony is therefore inseparable
          from a loss of control over domestic monetary policy — since measures
          that might be required to support the value of the currency would
          commonly be inconsistent with the responsibility to export money
          (through a negative current account balance).
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111601736.html">Chimerica</a>‘
          is
          the Triffin Dilemma exemplified in convenient binary form. On the
          one hand, economic leadership and the ‘exorbitant privilege’ of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage">seigniorage</a>
          (through which mere financial signs are swapped for substantial products
          and services), on the other economic policy dysfunction and
          de-industrialization, as American business activity is outsourced to
          China is exchange for symbolic monetary dominance. In this process, and
          paradox of power, the current instantiation of world order is captured
          in its essentials. The way modernity presently and concretely works
          cannot be made intelligible without reference to Triffin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-377"></span>The strong implication of the Triffin Dilemma
          — perhaps even ‘Triffin Paradox’ — is that global currency hegemony is
          ultimately ruinous for the financially sovereign nation. It involves
          something akin to an economic analog or variant of Paul Virilio’s
          ‘endo-colonization’
          <a href="http://aestech.wikischolars.columbia.edu/file/view/Virilio--Live-Selected_Interviews.pdf">which</a>
          “happens when a political power turns against its own people”
          progressing smoothly from predation to auto-cannibalization. The
          ‘exorbitant privilege’ of accessing real resources in exchange for mere
          promissory paper is maintained only at the cost of an
          <em>absolute</em> outsourcing — an international division of labor in
          which the master is compelled to specialize in financial signs,
          submitting to an accelerating atrophy of productive capability. An
          international reserve currency is therefore self-hollowing, in a vicious
          causal loop that substitutes pure political prowess — symbolic prestige
          — for the industrial advantages which originally promoted it. The
          culture it imposes accentuates consumerism, financial politicization,
          and hysterical sensitivity to the vicissitudes of signs. In the end,
          only the magic of power remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way out of this deteriorating structure has long been envisaged as a
          politically-managed international currency, whether the Keynesian
          ‘bancor’, or the IMF’s SDRs (Special Drawing Rights). The call such a
          scheme makes upon coherent international governance has reliably
          exceeded diplomatic and political practicality. It is notable, however,
          that a certain globalist fantasy is predictably generated by the
          stresses of currency hegemony, irrespective of all prior or ulterior
          ideological commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If US Dollar hegemony is unsustainable, and globalist remedies are
          realistically inaccessible, the world economic order has a catastrophic
          horizon. Crucially: with currency hegemony now understood as a trap, no
          sane national regime can be expected to advance itself as the
          <em>next America</em>. Whatever waits beyond the magic show has to be
          something new. It is under these conditions that — ‘coincidentally’ —
          the first post-national and radically depoliticized digital
          crypto-currencies have begun to appear upon the world stage …

          <em>Outside in</em> is preparing an open letter to the government of the
          PRC, recommending the creation of a Bitcoin clone. The state-level
          incentive for such an initiative would be to refashion the global
          financial order in preparation for the ending of US Dollar status as the
          world reserve currency. It does not seem difficult to present this as a
          matter of clear Chinese national interest, with definite spin-off
          benefits to the country’s political and economic elites, its ordinary
          savers, and supporters of economic freedom worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinocoin (to use its English name), would be released by the PBoC, and
          then — like BitCoin — be irretrievably autonomous. The Sinocoin
          algorithm would be a perfect Bitcoin clone, assuming (realistically)
          that the PRC government would not be inclined to upgrade it with
          strengthened user anonymity patches. However, PBoC reserves could be
          used, in accordance with a publicly announced policy, to sustain a floor
          valuation for the currency in its initial stages. Limited controls on
          RMB / Sinocoin exchange might provide a longer range mechanism for the
          suppression of Sinocoin volatility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinocoin would be a complementary initiative to Bitcoin, designed to
          avoid the disruptive effects that large-scale Chinese forex
          interventions would have on the latter currency. Bitcoin / Sinocoin
          exchange rates would provide a valuable index of Chinese financial
          integration into the emerging (Modernity 2.0) global economy. Parity is
          to be considered the ultimate natural equilibrium (with Sinocoin
          outperforming Bitcoin during its early decades).

          It was written is sequence, so the overall structure could have been
          tightened (in retrospect). Without external disciples — or at least its
          interiorized simulcrum — it would probably have been extended to five
          parts, or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part already contains the most pronounced conclusion. The
          emergence of blockchain-based monetary systems intersects with the
          geopolitics of world currencies, and will inevitably modulate their deep
          historical rhythms. The RMB is less likely to become the central world
          reserve currency in the blockchain-epoch, principally because this
          status is a poisoned chalice, subtracting effective economic control
          even as it cements nominal dominance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite superficial political reservations, and some characteristic
          patience (even inscrutability), the China factor is almost certain to
          advance the introduction of the decentralized public ledger
          <em>commercium</em>, which will organize the next-stage future of the
          global economy. None of these claims strike me as seriously
          controversial.

          What the technologies of steam power were to the epoch of British global
          dominance, and the twin-track developments of electricity and the
          automobile to the subsequent American Age, digital electronics—and, more
          specifically, the Internet—are to the “rise of China” and the
          refashioned world it epitomizes. It is only to be expected, therefore,
          that the intersection of the post-1979 Open-and-Reformed New China with
          the post-1990 World Wide Web-enabled Internet should be an object of
          particular international fascination, and practical concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the dawn of the modern epoch, geopolitical hegemony has been
          associated ever more intensely with techno-economic leadership, which
          has in turn been reflected in the international reserve status of a
          select national currency. An ever more explicitly formalized world
          monetary order has converted compelling but obscure intuitions of
          relative national prestige into an unambiguous system of financial
          relationships, in which a position of supremacy is clearly established,
          with a definite and singular role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suspicions fostered by leadership are no less inevitable than
          leadership itself. For easily intelligible historical reasons, the
          French policy establishment has been an especially vociferous critic of
          international reserve status and its “exorbitant privilege”<span class="review-note">1</span><span

        <p>
          Of the indispensable building blocks constructing the near future, China
          and the Internet have special prominence. There are innumerable places
          where China meets the Web, beginning with the sprawling,
          multidimensional, and explosively growing Chinese Internet itself.
          Bitcoin is a recent and still relatively slender thread in the tapestry
          of global change, but by tugging at it, some central features of the
          emerging world can be pulled into focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the characteristics that the Chinese yuan and bitcoin share is
          that neither is the US dollar. Specifically, both are limited yet
          practical alternatives to the dollar, at least at the level of
          microeconomic decision-making. When questions are raised about the
          durability of the dollar’s international role, it can be predicted with
          confidence that one or both of these challengers will be invoked. For
          the dollar to die of ice or fire is, today, for it to succumb to
          geopolitical substitution (by the Chinese yuan) or techno-financial
          obsolescence (by some decentralized, Internet-based crypto-currency).
        </p>
        <p>
          The international status of the US dollar concentrates two multi-century
          trends. Firstly, it represents the ethno-geographical peculiarity of
          modernity, which—up to the late twentieth century at least—tended to
          slant global power not only toward the West or Occident, but more
          specifically toward the Atlantic Anglophone nations, ultimately gathered
          under American leadership. Since the decline of the Spanish dollar,
          which monetized the treasure of the New World as the first global
          currency, international finance has been principally denominated in the
          currency of an English-speaking nation. Non-coincidentally, it has thus
          been tightly associated with a set of particular cultural themes,
          including (Philo-Semitic) Protestant Christianity, the invisible hand,
          free trade, and liberal democracy. The institutionalization of world
          finance has been intimately connected with the promotion of a
          distinct—and for many a distinctly questionable—cultural orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the formalization of a global monetary order has been
          accompanied by an incremental politicization of money, which is to say,
          by the consolidation of monetary policy as a core function of
          government. With the establishment of central banking and the
          demetallization of currency, intrinsic scarcity is replaced by an
          institutional “promise to pay” that converts money from a tangible asset
          into a contractual liability. Public confidence in the value of money is
          turned into a governmental responsibility. It becomes political, and—in
          the context of a world reserve currency—geopolitical.
        </p>
        <p>
          In combination, these trends are inevitably provocative, since they
          concentrate the world’s financial destiny in selected, identifiably
          non-representative hands. Behind the studied neutrality of the Bretton
          Woods institutions (the IMF and the World Bank) stands the US dollar as
          the symbol of American exception and the concrete peculiarity of the
          modern world order.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is natural—and even inevitable—for political command of the
          global reserve currency to be understood as the modern capstone of
          geopolitical hegemony, it is not a privilege separable from testing
          responsibilities, or from profound ambiguities. These have been clearly
          recognized since the 1960s, when Belgian-American economist Robert
          Triffin formulated the paradox or dilemma that bears his name: that if
          foreign governments are to accumulate reserves in one selected nation’s
          currency, that nation must necessarily be a net exporter of money—which
          can be achieved only by running a negative balance of trade. A nation
          issuing international reserve currency assumes responsibility for global
          monetary liquidity. This obliges it to consume more than it produces, in
          order for the difference to be made available as world money. While this
          requirement is merely seigniorage, seen from the other side, the
          constraint it imposes upon domestic economic policy options are so
          strict they amount almost to a destiny.
        </p>

        <p>
          These constraints are turned into a destructive dilemma by the fact that
          the mandatory policy structure required to supply the world with
          liquidity tends to destroy confidence in the currency at the same time,
          therefore undermining its value. Chronic balance of payments deficits
          signal currency weakness, since they would normally be interpreted as a
          sign that a currency is over-valued (or in need of devaluation). For the
          issuer of a global reserve currency, however, conventional policy
          responses to this situation are blocked in both directions, since it can
          neither take measures to close the deficit, nor attempt to strengthen
          the currency through elevating interest rates. Because for the reserve
          currency issuer the trade deficit is a constant, rather than a variable,
          a devaluation merely incites competitive currency destruction worldwide.
          Strengthening measures, on the other hand, draw in money from abroad
          (denominated in the international currency) and thus further expand the
          demand for issuance, which can only be satisfied by a widening of the
          trade deficit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, the Triffin Dilemma recognizes that international demand
          for a reserve currency is inherently paradoxical. What is sought is the
          currency as it would be were it not supplied through chronic trade
          imbalances, yet these same imbalances are the only channel through which
          it can in fact be supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Chimerica” perfectly exemplifies the essentials of the situation.
          China’s two trillion US dollars of reserves correspond to a cumulative
          balance of payments surplus of precisely the same sum, since this is
          simply what the reserves are. When perceived appreciatively—which was
          far easier in the final decades of the twentieth century than in the
          early decades of the twenty-first century—Chimerica has been a
          complementary economic arrangement through which America achieved high
          levels of consumption coupled with restrained price inflation, while
          China realized export-oriented economic development and the break-out
          modernization that had eluded it for 150 years. To more jaundiced eyes,
          the same arrangement is a trap that has married American
          de-industrialization to Chinese environmental devastation, while fueling
          unsustainable fiscal incontinence in America and a Chinese investment
          bubble. Whichever picture has greater realism, it can probably be safely
          concluded that the dissymmetry imposed by an international reserve
          currency has far-reaching and ambiguous consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cynically, it might be argued that the tributary aspect of reserve
          currency status is perfectly matched to deep Chinese traditions in
          international relations, so that an ascent to yuan-based exorbitant
          privilege would make a natural geopolitical goal for the Middle Kingdom,
          as it restored its central position in the world. More realistic
          however—at least in the near term—is a recognition that loss of domestic
          economic policy control is an inevitable, and well-understood,
          consequence of global currency hegemony, and it is one the Chinese
          government is certain to find unacceptable. Whatever the costs
          (primarily environmental) associated with the role of “workshop to the
          world” they are immensely outweighed, from the Chinese perspective, by
          the advantages. It is on the tributary side of the international reserve
          currency ledger, where China has been for over four decades, that all
          crucial vectors of development are to be found—technological absorption,
          infrastructural deepening, industrialization, urbanization, employment,
          and even military capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Chimerica is breaking down, it has far less to do with any kind of
          Chinese challenge—even a spontaneous and unintended one—than with a
          tragic structure inherent to currency hegemony. As hubris leads to
          nemesis, so does exorbitant monetary privilege lead to crisis, and even
          ruin. In both the Spanish and British precedents, financial supremacy
          became self-defeating, because exporting money (rather than things)
          differentially advantaged industrial competitors, locking in secular
          social decline. There is no compelling reason to believe that America
          has exempted itself from the same ominous pattern.

            href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/publish/english/956/2009/20091229104425550619706/20091229104425550619706.html">Reform
            the International Monetary System</a>.” He explicitly referred to the Triffin Dilemma as the key to
          understanding the world’s economic instability, while suggesting that a
          shift beyond US dollar hegemony would ultimately be required to remedy
          it. In this respect, his words conformed to a tradition dating back over
          half a century, to the Bretton Woods negotiations, when John Maynard
          Keynes recommended the introduction of a neutral global monetary
          medium—to be called the bancor—making the supply of global liquidity
          independent of national currencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, international reserve currencies have not arisen by
          design. It might be argued, therefore, that the Keynesian bancor was an
          unrealistic technocratic fix, blind to the spontaneous momentum that had
          already made a non-negotiable fact of the dollarized world, even before
          the Bretton Woods proceedings began. This did not prevent the same basic
          idea re-emerging in different guises, the most prominent of which has
          been the IMF’s SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), regularly proposed as a
          neutral international currency in embryo. It was still to SDRs that Zhou
          turned when searching out a candidate for a neutral world currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps some technocratic solution to the problem of monetary hegemony
          will ultimately be found, but if so it would mark an unprecedented
          departure from world financial history. If, as has always been the case
          to date, economic tides beyond policy control are to determine such
          outcomes, it is understandable that attention should drift toward the
          Chinese yuan as an eventual substitute for the US dollar. Yet the
          lessons of history are available to policymakers, even when the most
          insistent lesson concerns limitations upon their own influence, and in
          this case the foremost of these is that the prospect of an international
          reserve status yuan presents China with a poisoned chalice. It is very
          unlikely to be accepted willingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Might some alternative spontaneous evolution in the nature of money take
          this critical geopolitical dilemma in a new direction? Such an evolution
          appears to be occurring, symbolized by bitcoin, history’s first example
          of a decentralized digital crypto-currency. For China, bitcoin—or
          something comparable to it—could be the only way to evade an assumption
          of global economic privilege whose essence is ruinous hubris.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like James Frazer’s sacred king, who is crowned in order to be
          sacrificed, the inner meaning of monetary hegemony is economic and
          social destruction. China quite clearly understands this, and as the
          dollar era comes to a close, it is looking for a way out. That is how
          the China-bitcoin story really begins.

          <p>
            I have a lot of friends who are programmers. The programmers have
            always gone like, “Those [Bitcoin] guys are crazy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And then, almost 100 percent of the time, they sit down, read the
            paper, read the code—it takes them a couple weeks—and they come out
            the other side. And they’re like: “Oh my god, this is it. This is the
            big breakthrough. This is the thing we’ve been waiting for. He solved
            all the problems. Whoever he is should get the Nobel Prize—he’s a
            genius. This is the thing! This is the distributed trust network that
            the Internet always needed and never had.”
          </p>
          <p>
            So, one of the challenges is you take people who aren’t professional
            programmers or mathematicians and then you expect them to understand
            it from a standing start. And it’s daunting. And so then it gets a
            word attached to it, like ‘currency’ or whatever you want to call it,
            and then people think that it is something it isn’t. And you have a
            sense of this, but it’s a much deeper concept than currency. It’s the
            idea of distributed trust.

          It was noted in the first
          <a href="https://www.wdw.nl/en/review/desk/china_crypto_currency_and_the_world_order">part</a>
          of this essay series that the economic order of the world is being
          radically reshaped by two roughly coincidental transformations of
          stupendous consequence: a secular shift of industrial capability from
          the West toward the East, and an Internet-based revolution in the nature
          of money. Of these events, the former is already deeply established, and
          generally recognized, while the latter is still at an initial stage of
          emergence, and thus far less obvious in its implications. Their
          intersection remains deeply obscure.
        </p>
        <p>
          One topic that seems, tantalizingly, to connect these historical threads
          is the prospective death—or at least radical demotion—of the US dollar.
          The Triffin Dilemma argues that any currency attaining world reserve
          status tends, perhaps irresistibly, to destroy itself.<span class="review-note">1</span><span
            class="review-note-text">The mechanism, roughly described, is that the chronic trade deficits
            required for the international distribution of a reserve currency
            undermine the domestic economic fundamentals upon which that same
            currency’s credibility initially, and ultimately, depends. This
            endogenous mechanism is sharpened by geostrategic rivalry, and further
            destabilized by complicating, partially independent factors such as
            the vicissitudes of the petrodollar convention. In combination, their
            effect has exhibited a clear directionality in recent times, with the
            proportion of international foreign reserves held in US dollars
            declining from 55 percent to 33 percent since 2000.</span>
          America’s relative economic decline looks set to exacerbate the ‘winter’
          of this great cycle. From the other side, the dollar is threatened by
          the piecemeal emergence of an entirely unprecedented non-state currency
          system, disengaged from all the familiar institutions of monetary
          management. At the historical horizon of the globalized US dollar, the
          Chinese yuan and bitcoin are hazily gathered together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstractly anticipated, this twin-threat integrates into a single event
          of compounded significance, but concrete forecasting can easily become
          lost in its novel complexities. For roughly half a millennium,
          transitions in world economic leadership have been smoothed by cultural
          affinity and intimate strategic collaboration, within a commercial
          Protestant tradition that has shared a common language, and common
          enemies, since the late eighteenth century.<span class="review-note">2</span><span
            class="review-note-text">Transition of world economic leadership from the United Provinces to
            the United Kingdom was institutionally facilitated by transnational
            elite integration, crowned by the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The
            later succession of the United States to global economic preeminence
            involved a less clearly formalized, but nevertheless unmistakable
            degree of regime coordination, built in large part upon the military,
            administrative, and intelligence cooperation forged in the crucible of
            World War II. Innumerable indicators might be mentioned, including
            even the dynastic factor of Winston Churchill’s hybrid Anglo-American
            ancestry.</span>
          Nothing comparable is conceivable today, as American global supremacy
          erodes in a context of intense strategic competition and pronounced
          civilizational difference.

          Relative to the passage from the pound sterling to the US dollar,
          systematic adoption of the Chinese yuan would require “crossing the
          great ocean”—an expedition so daunting it is unlikely, in any
          straightforward sense, to take place. Superficially, digital
          cryptocurrencies are set at an even more distant remove, alien even to
          those commonalities that span the gulf between civilizations. Yet they
          are positively advanced by proximity to the world’s looming monetary
          precipice, because they represent a solution to the absence of trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word “bitcoin” stands for two very different things (although one
          contains the other). In its narrow and exact usage it names a specific
          currency, abbreviated as BTC, incarnating a radically innovative
          monetary system whose design was fully specified in Satoshi Nakamoto’s
          2008 “Bitcoin” paper.<span class="review-note">3</span><span class="review-note-text">The identity of Satoshi
            Nakamoto remains a topic of intense
            speculation, exceeding the bounds of the present discussion.</span>
          The currency became operational in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2008 paper is both a practical invention and a substantial
          contribution to the philosophy of money. Its central insight is that
          money functions as a rationing system, acquiring value or application to
          tradable goods and services through a scarcity <em>function</em>. If
          digital money is to realize this function, it has two interconnected
          problems to solve. It has to be intrinsically limited, and it has to be
          exclusively alienable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin solves the first of these problems by emulating a precious
          metal. It is earned through a process of mining that requires
          cryptographic work, in order to access bitcoins from a finite ‘reserve’,
          released in stages, amounting in total to 21 million BTC. Preserving the
          finitude of this bitcoin money stock depends on the solution to the
          second—or ‘double-spending’—problem. Considered the principal obstacle
          to the creation of digital money, the problem of double-spending arises
          automatically in a medium which effects transfers by copying. Unless
          money is deducted from the payer as it is credited to the payee,
          value-conserving expenditures are impossible, yet this simple
          operation—going against the grain of digital information exchange—seemed
          to require the introduction of a guarantor, or trusted external party,
          which the system itself was unable to integrally provide.

        <p>
          This is Bitcoin’s most unmistakable breakthrough. Every transaction
          taking place within the system is entered into a sequential public
          ledger, or blockchain, which has to be updated as a whole for any
          exchange to be registered. The cryptographic work of the system’s mining
          activity now acquires a secondary, automatic function, validating each
          blockchain iteration, and defending the ledger from usurpation by
          fraudulent agents. The guarantor of each value-preserving ‘cash’
          transfer is thus the entire blockchain itself, operating as a
          spontaneous or agent-independent trust mechanism. Through this
          continuously updated, integrated record of all commercial events, the
          blockchain supports a consistent account of Internet-communicable
          synthetic scarcity, or self-regulated digital rationing—in other words,
          the world’s first fully-decentralized electronic money system.Bitcoin
          scarcity is decentralized due to its independence from the promises of
          an issuing authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          In describing this system, one passes very rapidly from the singular to
          the generic, in a way that is easily understood by analogy, and worth
          dwelling upon momentarily. Had Netscape been adopted as the name for web
          browsers in general, certain confusions would almost certainly have
          arisen. Most significantly, the question “will Netscape survive?” would
          have been fatally ambiguous. As actual history has demonstrated,
          Netscape in this counter-factual sense was able both to die, and to
          thrive beyond all prior expectation. Many hundreds of millions of people
          use a ‘Netscape’ every day, although under other (specific and general)
          names, while only a vanishingly small fraction are aware that Netscape
          ever existed. It is not clear whether Bitcoin, in its specific sense,
          could ever be entirely extinguished, but it could certainly be
          marginalized to the edge of irrelevance: driven from the market by
          competitive cryptocurrencies through which Bitcoin, in the general
          sense, advances towards ubiquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its broadest evocation, Bitcoin symbolizes a gathering Internet
          revolution, of a scale and profundity that is difficult to exaggerate.
          The technical capability required to run BTC—installed
          blockchain-supporting software—has a potential extending far beyond the
          currency itself, and only a very small fraction of this has been
          explored thus far. This is most dramatically evidenced in the growth of
          a sprawling spin-off bitcoin ecology of altcoins, or Bitcoin-like P2P
          contract systems, tagged by the -coin suffix. Prominent altcoins include
          <a href="http://rockstarresearch.com/darkcoin-launched/">Darkcoin</a>,
          <a

          and <a href="https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin">Truthcoin</a>, with
          many others on the way. At the outer edge of blockchain abstraction lie
          applications such as
          <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2014/04/difilippi?utm">Ethereum</a>, whose
          Turing-complete
          scripting language can support smart contracts,
          and even autonomous intelligent agents. At this point of sophistication,
          the ultimate potentialities of the system are not merely undetermined,
          but undeterminable in principle, and the gateway to a previously
          unvisited techno-commercial cosmos is opened.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this extreme generality that Eli Dourado celebrates in his
          <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/01/08/bitcoin-internet-of-money/">article</a>
          “Bitcoin isn’t Money—It’s the Internet of Money,” arguing:<br />
          Bitcoin is not just a substitute for money; it can be a form of
          generalized, programmable, decentralized
          <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts">contracting</a>. […] Most
          of Bitcoin’s critics are making a category error. They are taking aim at
          Bitcoin the currency, when in fact Bitcoin is much more than a currency,
          in the same way that the Internet is much more than the
          telecommunication services that preceded it. […] Bitcoin is a new
          transport layer for finance that allows decentralized,
          <a href="https://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml">disruptive</a>,
          permissionless <span class="review-note">4</span><span class="review-note-text">Dourado cites Vinton Cerf’s
            2012

            conceptual role.</span>
          development of applications on a separate layer. It has the capability
          to do for finance what the Internet did for communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the blockchain-based facilities Dourado envisages are assurance
          contracts, prediction markets, and continuous micropayments, as well as
          notary, bonded identity, and reputation rating services. It is easy to
          see why ‘getting’ Bitcoin triggers something akin to metaphysical shock.
          As a self-sufficient digital depository for legal identity, it
          exhibits—virtually—a potential to absorb the cultural infrastructure of
          formal transactions without obvious limit. There is perhaps no
          conceivable ‘deal’ without blockchain compatibility, and therefore no
          definite horizon to its commercial, legal, or even political utility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of particular relevance here is the blockchain innovation of artificial
          trust often referred to as trustlessness since it
          <em>substitutes for trust</em>, and is thus pre-adapted to a world in
          which trust is unavailable.[ref]Google the combination “trustless +
          bitcoin” for abundant confirmation.[/ref] Under the conditions currently
          impending, a global hegemonic transition occurring beyond international
          consensus or civilizational continuity, this deep feature of Bitcoin
          seems certain to be foregrounded. By apparent remarkable coincidence, a
          collapsing order of promises, or credible global authorities, is
          accompanied by the emergence of an alternative system of credibility. As
          the traditional supports of the world’s institutional architecture are
          subjected to accelerating erosion,<span class="review-note">5</span><span class="review-note-text">Monetary
            authorities are the most relevant example here, but every
            institution dependent upon some measure of public trust is, in
            principle, susceptible to implicit competition from blockchain-based
            (trustless) alternatives.</span>
          the premium upon trustless functionality can only increase. Bitcoin
          suggests itself as a replacement for authoritative guarantors, while
          opening entirely novel vistas of decentralized institutional creation.
          The contextual friction, dysfunction, and disagreement of a world in
          hegemonic disarray only reinforce its attraction.
        </p>

          In comparison to the <em>smooth</em> transitions in economic supremacy,
          from the United Provinces, to the United Kingdom, to the United States,
          the passage beyond the American world order can only be considered
          <em>rough</em>. It is this roughness that shapes the socket, for which
          Bitcoin—in its most expansive sense—is the plug. The installation of
          trustless systems fits into a hole in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          How does the rise of trustless Internet technology modify the strategic
          landscape of the great powers, and the world’s other principal actors?
          To what extent can their responses be anticipated? Only by addressing
          these questions can some concreteness be introduced to our understanding
          of the path ahead. They therefore provide the topic for the third (and
          final) part of this series.

            The German school argued that emphasizing consumption would eventually
            be self-defeating. It would bias the system away from wealth
            creation—and ultimately make it impossible to consume as much. To use
            a homely analogy: One effect of getting regular exercise is being able
            to eat more food, just as an effect of steadily rising production is
            being able to consume more. But if people believe that the reason to
            get exercise is to permit themselves to eat more, rather than for
            longer term benefits they will behave in a different way. List’s
            argument was that developing productive power was in itself a reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            […] The German view is more paternalistic [than that of the
            Anglo-Americans]. People might not automatically choose the best
            society or the best use of their money. The state, therefore, must be
            concerned with both the process and the result. Expressing an Asian
            variant of the German view, the sociologist Ronald Dore has written
            that the Japanese—“like all good Confucianists”—believe that “you
            cannot get a decent, moral society, not even an efficient society,
            simply out of the mechanisms of the market powered by the motivational
            fuel of self-interest.” So, in different words, said Friedrich List.

          The perception of the Chinese Internet among international observers and
          commentators is dominated by an impression of <em>control</em>.<span class="review-note">1</span><span
            class="review-note-text">The theatrical tradition of Chinese power is an indispensable
            reference here. China has been exceptional among the great
            civilizations for the emphasis it has placed upon public perception as
            the key to administrative authority, with an understanding of rule as
            essentially <em>dramatic</em>. In the narrow context that concerns us
            here, it is important to note that in the eyes of the Chinese
            authorities
            <em>being seen to control Internet communications</em> takes
            precedence over the subordinate and instrumental social and technical
            capabilities involved. This can be contrasted with Internet security
            politics in the United States, where invisible data-traffic monitoring
            receives clear priority.</span>
          At the center of China’s—deliberately conspicuous—system of digital
          communications oversight stands the Golden Shield project, far more
          popularly known as “the Great Firewall of China.”
        </p>
        <p>
          No less than the original Great Wall, or even the Imperial Palace, the
          Great Firewall is a monument. It is first of all a statement, and only
          secondarily a functional apparatus, with capabilities sufficient to give
          said statement public credibility. What it overtly means is more
          important than what it covertly does. The message is long familiar, and
          recognizably Confucian rather than distinctly communist: signaling
          social

          is not a tolerable cultural decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems to be an improbable environment in which to insert blockchain
          cryptosystems. Bitcoin unmistakably retains an aura of extreme social
          defiance.<span class="review-note">2</span><span class="review-note-text">In order to arrive at a remotely
            concrete sense of “defiance” it is
            no doubt important to distinguish between those actors (associated
            more with the Left) seeking to break into the public sphere in the
            name of protest, and those (associated more with the Right) seeking to
            break out of the public sphere, to protect private interests from
            social or government accountancy. It can scarcely be controversial to
            propose that, while concern for the latter is by no means negligible
            in today’s China, it is the former that elicits genuine alarm.</span>
          The legacy of the libertarian-oriented hacker counterculture remains
          clearly legible in its founding documentation and among its first-wave
          supporters. Among its most ardent proponents, the vitriolic
          presupposition of government illegitimacy is combined with an
          approximately unconditional endorsement of anarchistic—or at least
          <a href="http://www.agorism.info/">agoristic</a>—practices.<span class="review-note">3</span><span
            class="review-note-text">This aspect of Bitcoin has been dramatized by the online black-market
            Silk Road run by Dread Pirate Roberts (Ross Ulbricht), recently

            by Daniel Krawisz as “the greatest agorist of our times.”</span>
          In this sense, Bitcoin appears as the impending fulfillment of the “<a
            href="http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/">Californian Ideology</a>”—a
          hyper-capitalist assertion of spontaneous order, or radical
          decentralization, essentially antagonistic to all concentrated

          Any balanced estimation of Bitcoin’s prospects in China has to begin
          with a realistic correction of this impression. While insight into
          Chinese security analysis is never easily attained, it can be
          confidently assumed that revolutionary agorism does not figure
          prominently on any official list of Internet threats. Even in America,
          in comparatively close cultural proximity to the ‘cipherpunks’ of the
          West Coast, Bitcoin is undergoing rapid, and far-reaching
          domestication.<span class="review-note">4</span><span class="review-note-text">This trend is personified by
            Marc
            Andreessen, whose

            of Bitcoin “mainstreaming” includes an explicit attempt to reframe the
            blockchain (distributed public ledger) as a <em>defense</em> against
            excessive anonymity, fully compatible with government regulatory
            interests. Insofar as arguments of this kind are found persuasive in
            Washington DC and New York, they are likely to find an appreciative
            reception in Beijing.</span>
          In China, where ideological libertarianism is effectively nonexistent,
          the possibility of technologically catalyzed anarchist politics has to
          seem vanishingly remote.

          The concerns of Chinese officials with regards to the Internet are quite
          different. They are overwhelmingly oriented to the perceived threat of
          mass activism, triggered by social media networks, and exemplified by
          the dynamics of the so-called Color Revolutions in the ex-Soviet
          republics and subsequently by the Arab Spring.<span class="review-note">5</span><span

            contribution of social media to these events, the seriousness with
            which it was taken by the Chinese authorities is beyond serious
            question. During the spring of 2011, the word “Jasmine” was targeted
            for
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/world/asia/11jasmine.html?_r=0">suppression</a>
            by the Chinese Great Firewall filter, despite its rich cultural
            resonances in the country.</span>
          It is the capacity of the Internet to amplify a dissident public
          ‘voice’, rather than to facilitate a private ‘exit’, that determines the
          security priorities of the Great Firewall. From this perspective, the
          Bitcoin menace is relatively minor, even trivial, in comparison to
          Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and similar channels of vocal dissent.

          The administrative challenges Bitcoin does pose to the Chinese
          authorities are of a technical, rather than existential-ideological,
          nature, and only tangentially related to the country’s monumental
          apparatus of Internet control. The most politically-charged concern is
          capital flight or money laundering, but this is a topic of mind-boggling
          complexity, involving everything from high-level corruption on a titanic
          scale, through organized crime, to informally tolerated business
          activities and the attempts of small private actors to secure savings or
          diversify regime risk. Corruption is clearly perceived by the Chinese
          Communist Party as an indirect source of political insecurity, and few
          doubt that the potential of Bitcoin to facilitate the concealment and
          expatriation of illicit funds was a leading motive for the restrictions
          imposed so far.<span class="review-note">6</span><span class="review-note-text">BTC China was founded in June

          In “How the World Works,” James Fallows excavates the neo-mercantilist
          political-economic theory of Friedrich List from its oblivion within the
          Anglophone world. He argues that the <em>laissez-faire</em> commercial
          ideal, considered by English-speaking nations as an undisputed norm of
          rational economic order, has a remarkably limited application beyond
          these nations. Elsewhere it is treated as a set of impractical,
          culturally and situationally specific principles, to which only the most
          nominal deference can safely be paid. The passage of two decades has
          done nothing to erode the pertinence of this observation.

          List’s “German System,” which was also Alexander Hamilton’s “American
          System”—and indeed the ‘system’ of every challenger power seeking
          accelerated industrialization under conditions of strategic
          disadvantage—was characterized by a series of anomalous features
          relative to the free-market hegemonic norm that has been identified with
          Anglophone cultures for over two centuries, and maritime Protestant
          Atlantic powers for longer still.<span class="review-note">7</span><span class="review-note-text">Fallows
            usefully
            lists the distinctive emphases of the “German
            System”: planning over spontaneity; producers over consumers; outcome
            over process; national over individual interest; zero-sum over
            positive-sum economic relations; and Realpolitik over moralism.</span>
          Yet even these core economic powers, prior to their ascent to industrial
          dominion, subordinated commercial liberties to nationalistic development
          imperatives. Both geographically and historically, the ‘normality’ of
          the open market is exposed as rare and precarious. As Fallows remarks in
          “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1993/12/how-the-world-works/305854/">How the World
            Works</a>”:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Every country that has caught up with others has had to do so by
            rigging its rules: extracting extra money from its people and steering
            the money into industrialists’ hands. […] Today’s Americans and
            Britons may not like this new system, which makes their economic life
            more challenging and confusing than it would otherwise be. They are
            not obliged to try to imitate its structure, which in many ways fits
            the social circumstances of East Asia better than those of the modern
            United States or Britain. But the English-speaking world should stop
            ignoring the existence of this system—and stop pretending that it
            doesn’t work.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Where Chinese Internet policy is concerned, “ignoring the existence of
          this system” amounts to an interpretative orientation fixated upon
          domestic security politics and human rights issues, while overlooking
          its neo-mercantilist features. When this bias is corrected, the “Chinese
          System” of digital mercantilism can be seen as a classic example of
          strategically accelerated industrialization, based upon selective
          protections directed at those business sectors perceived as most
          essential to the nation’s economic future. Quite evidently, the Internet
          occupies center stage in this strategy, which identifies it as the basic
          techno-economic platform of the twenty-first-century world. Arguably,
          the peculiarities of the Chinese Internet make far more sense in the
          context of geo-strategic industrial competition, than in that of
          domestic regime insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most pronounced features of the “Chinese System” are not
          restrictions on free political expression—although these can of course
          be found—but rather the emergence of domestic Chinese business analogs
          for the major players of the international (i.e., American) Internet
          economy. The most obvious digital Sino-clones include Baidu (Google),
          <a href="http://projects.wsj.com/alibaba/">Taobao</a> (eBay, Amazon),
          Youku (YouTube), Weibo (Twitter), WeChat (Facebook), and Alipay
          (Paypal). From this perspective, it begins to seem that much less is
          being <em>prevented</em> than <em>replicated</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As previously noted in this series, Bitcoin designates both a specific
          digital cryptocurrency (BTC), and a technical innovation in electronic
          communications of extreme generality (the blockchain), potentially
          enveloping all Internet-based activity. Besides its intrinsic
          significance, the currency can be understood as a test implementation of
          the blockchain system. Increasingly, as the anticipated techno-economic
          consequences of the blockchain breakthrough have loomed ever larger, it
          is the second, expansive sense of Bitcoin that has begun to prevail—even
          as the currency has entrenched itself among the world’s resilient
          monetary realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the extraordinary
          <a href="http://theumlaut.com/2014/01/08/bitcoin-internet-of-money/">implications</a>
          of blockchain technology have come into focus,<span class="review-note">8</span><span
            class="review-note-text">Although the ultimate scope of Bitcoin escapes ready apprehension, it
            is already clear that it is roughly coextensive with the form of the
            contract in general, within which monetary systems are comprehended.
            Any actually or potentially formal human agreement is blockchain
            compatible, and it is through the blockchain that many previously
            tacit social arrangements can be expected to attain formalization. The
            horizon of the blockchain, therefore, is that of deal-making in
            general. Once this is understood, the predictions of those such as
            Marc Andreessen—who sees the potential blockchain economy scaling into
            the multi-trillion-dollar range within a matter of decades—seem
            entirely reasonable. Global commerce, as a whole, is in principle a
            subset of blockchain-supported relationships. As this becomes ever
            more obvious, the prospect of an economically ambitious society
            attempting to opt out of this future will become increasingly
            implausible. It is already unimaginable that China could want to do
            so.</span>
          historical analogies have escalated. While it may once have made sense
          to compare Bitcoin to a particular Internet application of great
          generality, such as the web browser, or perhaps to the World Wide Web, a
          general-purpose platform built upon the Internet, it is increasingly
          <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/485766031411933184">common</a>
          to find blockchain technology compared to the Internet as such. On this

          How might the “Chinese System” be expected to respond to this emerging
          reality? Everything we have seen so far points in one direction:
          <em>Clone war</em>. For China to reject the blockchain revolution would
          be an abdication from all industrial leadership ambitions in the coming
          digital economy. The only Chinese strategic option compatible with the
          digital industrialization path so far taken is a Sinification of the
          technology—a blockchain with Chinese characteristics, in which
          distributed ledger systems are accommodated to the country’s social and
          cultural realities. There is no reason to think this will be an easy
          thing to achieve, but nothing else could possibly work.

        </a>
        <h5><em>East-plus-West at the frontier of freedom</em></h5>
        <p>
          In accordance with the widely-held belief that digital communication
          technologies ‘destroy distance’, James C. Bennett
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anglosphere-Challenge-English-Speaking-Nations-Twenty-First/dp/0742533328"
            target="_blank">coined</a>
          the term ‘Anglosphere’ to describe the arena of comparatively
          frictionless cultural proximity binding spatially-dispersed Anglophone
          populations. His contention was that the gathering trends exemplified by
          the development of the Internet would continue to promote cultural ties,
          whilst eroding the importance of spatial neighborhoods. In the age of
          the World Wide Web, cultural solidarity trumps geographical solidarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst alternative culture-spheres – expressly including the Sinosphere
          – were mentioned in passing, they were not the focus of Bennett’s
          account. His attention was directed to English-speaking peoples,
          scattered geographically, yet bound together by threads of common
          understanding that derived from a shared language, English common law
          and limited-government traditions, highly-developed civil societies,
          individualism, and an unusual tolerance for disruptive social change. He
          predicted both that these commonalities would become increasingly
          consequential in the years to come, and that their general tenor would
          prove highly adaptive as the rate of social change accelerated
          worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bennett’s concern with large-scale cultural systems can be seen as part
          of an intellectual trend, comparable in significant respects to Samuel
          Huntington’s influential ‘Clash of Civilizations’ thesis. In a world
          that is undergoing tectonic shifts in the distribution of wealth, power,
          and hegemony, such preoccupations are understandable. In these
          circumstances, it would be surprising if the partisans of Anglospheric
          and Sinospheric cultural traditions were not aroused to ardent advocacy
          of their relative merits and demerits, and — if Bennett is taken
          seriously — such discussions will take place in zones of cultural
          communion that are, at least relatively, increasingly introverted. The
          rapid emergence of a highly-autonomous ‘Chinese Internet’ in recent
          years adds weight to such expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March, the
          <a href="http://www.zyen.com/" target="_blank">Z/Yen Group</a> released
          the ninth in its series of Global Financial Centres Index rankings, in
          which Shanghai leapt to shared fifth place with Tokyo (on GFCI ratings
          of 694). London (775), New York (769), Hong Kong (759), and Singapore
          (722) led the pack. (The top 75 can be seen
          <a href="http://www.longfinance.net/component/gfcigraph/" target="_blank">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Anglosphereans and Sinosphereans can find ready satisfaction in
          these ratings. The persistent supremacy of London and New York attests
          to a 250-year history of world economic dominance, whilst the ascent of
          Chinese-ethnicity commercial cities to the remaining top-slots clearly
          indicates the shift of economic gravity to the western Pacific region.
          Yet the most interesting pattern lies in-between. Neither Hong Kong nor
          Singapore belong unambiguously to a Sinosphere (still less to a broad
          Anglosphere). Instead, they are characterized by distinctive forms of
          Chinese-Anglophone hybridity – an immensely successful cultural
          synthesis. It would be difficult to maintain that Shanghai was entirely
          untouched by a comparable phenomenon, inherited in that case from the
          synthetic mentality of its concession-era International Settlement, and
          reflected in its singular Haipai or ‘ocean culture’.
        </p>
        <p>
          The existence of an identifiable Sino-Anglosphere – or Singlosphere – is
          further suggested by the Heritage Foundation’s
          <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/" target="_blank">2011 Index of Economic Freedom</a>
          (rated on a scale of 0-100). On that list, the top two places are taken
          by Hong Kong (89.7) and Singapore (87.2), followed by Australia (82.5)
          and New Zealand (82.3). The Anglospherean and Sinospherean territorial
          cores fare less impressively, with none meeting the Heritage criteria
          for free economies — the United States comes ninth (77.8), the United
          Kingdom 16th (74.5), and mainland China 135th (52.0). It seems that the
          Singlosphere has learnt something about economic freedom that exceeds
          the presently-manifested wisdom of both cultural root-stocks – setting a
          model for the Sinosphere, and leaving the Anglosphere trailing in its
          wake.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the deep secular trend of Chinese ascent and (relative if not
          absolute) American decline leads to ever more ominous rumblings and
          threats of geostrategic tension, it is especially important to note a
          quite different, non-confrontational pattern – based upon cultural
          merging and reciprocal liberation. Within the Singlosphere, an emergent,
          synthetic ethnicity exhibits a dynamically adaptive, cosmopolitan
          competence without peer, as distinct traditions of spontaneous order
          fuse and reinforce each other. Adam Smith meets Laozi, and the profound
          amalgamation of the two results in an unfolding innovated culture that
          increasingly dominates world rankings of economic capability.

          by Christian Gerlach excavates the Daoist roots of European
          laissez-faire (or wu wei) ideas, and anarcho-capitalist maverick Murray
          Rothbard was attracted to the same ‘<a href="http://mises.org/daily/1967" target="_blank">Ancient Chinese
            Libertarian Tradition</a>’. Ken McCormick calls it
          <a href="http://college.holycross.edu/RePEc/eej/Archive/Volume25/V25N3P331_341.pdf" target="_blank">The Tao of
            Laissez-Faire</a>. (Those disturbed by this identification might be more comfortable
          with Silja Graupe’s leftist

          of ‘Market Daoism’.)
        </p>
        <p>McCormick concludes his essay:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>The recent ascendance of free-market ideas around the world
              probably owes more to the practical historical success of those
              ideas than to the persuasiveness of any theory or philosophy. Yet
              one might speculate that the startling success of economic
              liberalization in the People’s Republic of China might in part be
              explained by the fact that the idea of free markets is embedded in
              the culture. In fact, the Confucianism that long dominated China was
              actually a synthesis of competing schools of thought, including
              Taoism … Hence, while laissez-faire has frequently been absent from
              Chinese practice, it is not at all alien to Chinese culture. The
              recent free-market reforms in China might therefore be interpreted
              not so much as an importation of a foreign ideology but as a
              reawakening of a home-grown concept.</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Singlosphere sets both East and West on the right track. The more
          that Shanghai recalls and learns from it — and the deeper its
          participation — the faster its ascent will be.

          <h4 class="post-title">Pacific Rim</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Well-engineered, formidable, yet also lumbering constructions are
          directed into battle against horrific monsters, with the fate of the
          world at stake. Guillermo del Toro’s
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/">movie</a>
          <em>Pacific Rim</em> is one of these entities, and the ethno-political
          <a
            href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/09/the-multicultural-monster-movie-pacific-rim-reviewed/">review</a>
          by ‘white advocacy’ writer Gregory Hood is another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within this cascade of monstrous signs, a convulsive re-ordering of the
          world from out of the Pacific is a constant reference. With the shocking
          scale of a tsunami, and the insidiousness of an obscure intelligence, it
          inundates the Old Order, starting from the ocean’s coastal ramparts.
          “When alien life entered the earth it was from deep within the Pacific
          Ocean. … the Breach.” City after city falls prey to the <em>Kaiju</em>.
          “This was not going to stop.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-1259"></span>The response is formulaic, and statically
          defensive. Perhaps some kind of massive sea-wall will work? Hood is at
          his best in laying out the weary Cathedralist pieties of the Hollywood
          plot line:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind, filmmakers
            are the educators, grooming the mass public to accept certain ideas in
            preparation for them to be implemented as policy. The acceptance of
            global security forces instead of national armies, the worship of
            blacks as natural leaders, and the promotion of an international
            political creed of egalitarianism, secular humanism, and intrusive
            (but benevolent) government …
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the plot-line of his review is no less predictable than that of the
          movie, appealing to a irrecoverable (and already mythical) confidence in
          a white lineage of ethno-nationalist self-government,
          functionally-adequate native traditions, and tested bonds of kin, as if
          all of these things remained untried resources to fall back upon, rather
          than efficient historical antecedents to the developments now being
          deplored. It was under the conditions of white global dominion that
          socialism was entrenched, and evangelical moral universalism elevated to
          its climactic pitch of ethno-masochistic implosion. Defenselessness
          before the <em>Kaiju</em> was not something the <em>Kaiju</em> brought
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most telling blindness of Hood’s review lies close to its heart, in
          the denunciation of multiculturalism. Rather than striking at Del Toro’s
          movie at its point of maximum Cathedralist vulneraility — which is to
          say, in its entirely generic, universalist presentation of the
          multicultural ideal — Hood repeats this same indiscriminate category
          without significant modification, seeking only to criticize what Del
          Toro promotes. This would be seriously unserious anywhere. On the
          Pacific Rim, it is a truly disastrous disqualification of perception.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reality-sensitive response to the problem of multiculturalism
          is to ask: <em>Which cultures?</em> Neither Del Toro (the Cathedral),
          nor Hood (ethno-traditionalism), seem to have the slightest interest
          in this question. Indiscriminate demographic entropy is either to be
          promoted, or lamented, but in both cases accepted as the only relevant
          alternative to a fantastically-imagined, dying world of distinct
          peoples. If the paint is let out of the tubes, it has to be stirred
          together with maximum conceptual rapidity into homogeneous brown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing the film’s central micro-alliance, between its occidental
          hero and oriental heroine, Hood writes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>None of this makes any sense of course. The “drift compatible”
            connection seems to require a kind of deep bond that almost always
            requires family ties. However, in this film, the conflict is driven by
            the struggle of the rebellious hero and the non-white female to prove
            that two people who have no shared history or kinship can work
            together, and in fact be better than everyone else. Where traditional
            national and family bonds have failed us, multiculturalism will save
            the day.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          As an ethno-racial descriptor, ‘non-white’ is simply sad. It isn’t even
          trying. Concretely, in this case, it ensures that the true nonsense of
          the movie eludes attention, which is the displacement of  real Pacific
          Rim ethno-synthesis by a merely cosmetic substitute.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Hood emphatically notes, the relationship between (white American)
          Raleigh and (Japanese) Mako is not explicitly romantic, but it occupies
          the formula-position of a film romance, even when — admirably — it
          restricts itself to an intense practical partnership. I just love
          Japanese-American ethno-synthesis to bits, but it has almost no
          relevance to the real cultural process on the Pacific Rim, which is
          overwhelmingly dominated by Anglo-Chinese hybridism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japan is one of the world’s few modern ethno-nationalist states, with a
          strongly-preserved native culture, tightly-restricted immigration and
          citizenship criteria, and low English-language competence. In other
          words, it makes a <em>far</em> more tempting target for
          ‘multiculturalist’ (or demographic entropy) criticism than America does.
          But it’s ‘non-white’ so Hood doesn’t notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even more peculiarly — and despite its Hong Kong setting  —
          <em>Pacific Rim</em> represents China’s contribution to the
          multicultural alliance through three weirdo brothers who get rubbed out
          at the first plausible opportunity. Without wanting to be unnecessarily
          crude, I have to repeat — <em>Hong fricking Kong</em>. This is the
          post-1949 capital of the
          <a href="http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/articles/472">Singlosphere</a>, and therefore the natural location
          for
          a centrally accentuated
          <em>US-Japanese</em> working relationship? If this isn’t quite “who
          cares? They’re all wogs anyway” it’s something remarkably close.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pacific Rim, insofar as it matters, is the a Singlosphere cultural
          catastrophe, a distinctively non-generic ethno-synthesis that has
          created the most advanced and competitive societies on the planet — Hong
          Kong, Singapore, and Old Shanghai among them. Del Toro and Hood conspire
          to efface this fact, even as both, indirectly, address it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Insofar as we are told anything, it is that in our most desperate
            moments, we have to jettison Tradition. Instead, we must rely on
            feelings, on multicultural partnership, on wishes and fantasies and
            hopes about what the world might be, rather than what it is.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/articles/472">–</a>– that’s
          Hood, not remotely understanding what he’s saying.

          seems right:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Razeen Sally, a visiting associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew
            School of Public Policy, wrote this year in Singapore’s Straits Times
            that: “A global city is where truly global services cluster. Business
            — in finance, the professions, transport and communications — is done
            in several languages and currencies, and across several time zones and
            jurisdictions. Such creations face a unique set of challenges in the
            early 21st century. Today, there appear to be only five global cities.
            London and New York are at the top, followed by Hong Kong and
            Singapore, Asia’s two service hubs. Dubai, the Middle East hub, is the
            newest and smallest kid on the block. Shanghai has global-city
            aspirations, but it is held back by China’s economic restrictions —
            the vestiges of an ex-command economy — and its Leninist political
            system. Tokyo remains too Japan-centric, a far cry from a global
            city.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a striking indication of the extent to which the world order
          remains structured by the Anglo-Colonial legacy. However one would
          <em>like</em> to see the world run, this hub-net is an essential clue to
          the way it is run now.

          at the planetary strategic environment puts recent developments in
          theoretical context:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>After decades of quiet preparation, Beijing has recently begun
            revealing its grand strategy for global power, move by careful move.
            Its two-step plan is designed to build a transcontinental
            infrastructure for the economic integration of the world island from
            within, while mobilizing military forces to surgically slice through
            Washington’s encircling containment.</em>

        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>The initial step has involved a breathtaking project to put in place
            an infrastructure for the continent’s economic integration. By laying
            down an elaborate and enormously expensive network of high-speed,

            the vast breadth of Eurasia, China may realize Mackinder’s vision in a

            movement of critical cargo — oil, minerals, and manufactured goods —
            will be possible on a massive scale, thereby potentially unifying that
            vast landmass into a single economic zone stretching 6,500 miles from
            Shanghai to Madrid. In this way, the leadership in Beijing hopes to
            shift the locus of geopolitical power away from the maritime periphery
            and deep into the continent’s heartland.</em>

          As a trivial point of perspective, it might be worth noting that this
          blog’s ferocious
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/new-atlantis/">Atlanteanism</a>
          completely overwhelms its Sinophilia in regard to this question. If the
          emergence of a diasporic-maritime China, attuned to its Pacific Rim
          ethnic offshoots, is to be forestalled by a revival of dreams of
          dominion on the world island, the 21st century is about to take a
          peculiarly unfortunate turn.

        </a>
        <h5><em>China’s rise and the future of threedom</em></h5>
        <p>
          According to
          <a href="http://www.ny-forum.com/forumblog/2011/09/in-chinas-shadow-qa-with-arvind-subramanian/"
            target="_blank">Arvind Subramanian</a>, even conservative projections of comparative growth trends place
          China in a global position, by 2030, that is strikingly similar to that
          of Britain and of America at their respective moments of economic
          predominance, accounting for a share of the world economy roughly 150%
          the size of its closest rival. If this were to come to pass, such
          leadership would invoke ‘hegemony’ as a matter of sheer quantitative
          fact – quite irrespective of explicit intentions. The ‘Chinese model’
          would promote itself, even in the complete absence of political and
          diplomatic reinforcement, and the magnetic power of Chinese culture
          would continue to strengthen in approximate proportion to its commercial
          influence. China would become the object of irresistible attraction –
          counterbalanced, no doubt, by resentments – and its example would burn
          incandescent, even in the offended eyes of its detractors. So what is
          this ‘example’?
        </p>
        <p>
          In exploring this question, one place to begin is the history of
          economic hegemony, and in particular that instantiated by the
          Anglo-American powers over their two ‘long centuries’ of global
          supremacy. This is a topic pursued with exceptional insight by Walter
          Russell Mead, most remarkably in his work
          <em>God and Gold: Britain, America, and the Making of the Modern
            World</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mead locates the key to ‘Anglosphere’ hegemony in the ‘Golden Meme’ of
          the invisible hand, originating in the religious idea of providence, and
          modernized in Newtonian celestial mechanics, Smithian political economy,
          and Darwinian evolutionary biology. At its most abstract, this idea is
          both an affirmation and a renunciation, with its potency and suppleness
          stemming from both. To acknowledge the invisible hand is to foster a
          special kind of positive fatalism, trusting in the spontaneous trend of
          history, which is embraced as a covenant, and an overt or implicit
          election (in the theological sense). Such themes are undisguisedly
          religious, and Mead does nothing to obscure their roots in the Abrahamic
          tradition, or meta-tradition, which lays out a providential vision of
          history as finite, progressive, and inevitable, tending inexorably to
          eschatological completion, structured by superhuman law, and (through
          its divine predestination) facilitating the function of prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deep culture of the Anglosphere is not only generically Abrahamic,
          however, it is also specifically pluralistic. The invisible hand takes
          center stage because the center is otherwise vacated, or distributed.
          Esoteric providence supplants exoteric sovereignty because an inability
          to reach agreement is eventually institutionalized – or at least
          informally stabilized — in a triangular balance of power.

            <em>What the British ultimately did was to rely on what Burke called
              “convention.” Scripture, tradition, and reason – each had its place
              and each had its devotees. But all of them went wrong if you pressed
              them too far. You should respect the scriptures and defer to them
              but not interpret the scriptures in a way that led you into some
              weird millenarian sect or into absurd social behavior. You honored
              tradition but did not press it so far that it led you into the arms
              of royal absolutism or papal power. You can and should employ the
              critique of reason against the excesses of both scripture and
              tradition, but not press reason to the point where you ranted
              against all existing institutions., ate roots and bark for your
              health, or, worse, undermined the rights of property and the
              established church. One can picture John Bull scratching his head
              and slowly concluding that one must accept that in society there
              will be bible nuts, tradition nuts, and reason nuts –
              fundamentalists, papists, and radicals. This is not necessarily the
              end of the world. To some degree they cancel each other out – the
              fundamentalist zealots will keep the papists down and vice versa,
              and the religious will keep the radicals in their place – but the
              competition among sects will also prevent the established church
              from pressing its advantage too far and from forming too exalted an
              idea about the proper stature, prestige, and emoluments of the
              clergy.</em>

          Cultural hegemony follows from a semi-deliberate <em>fatalization</em>,
          as the sovereign center is displaced by a substantially automated social
          process, which no social agent is able to master or entirely impede.
          Each major faction steps back into its position in the triangle, from
          which it can strategically engage the others, but never fully dominate
          or eradicate them. The triangle as a whole constitutes a social and
          historical motor, without adequate representation at any identifiable
          point.

          This blog has
          <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/singlosphere/">previously</a>
          touched upon the Singlosphere, where aspects of Anglophone and Chinese
          culture converge in Manchester Liberal / Daoist acceptance of
          spontaneous order, or laissez-faire. Does this convergence extend to
          triadic pluralism, and apply to the Sinosphere core of the Chinese
          mainland? Mead’s analysis is highly suggestive in both respects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, it encourages considerable equanimity in regards to
          the prospective global transition, even when attention is focused upon
          the political and ideological heartland of contemporary China. It might
          seem, superficially, that the passage from a leading world culture
          dominated by tacit Christian attitudes to one in which unfamiliar
          Sino-Marxist ideas rise to unprecedented international prominence must
          be characterized by an immense – even near-absolute – discontinuity. Can
          such a leap take place without succumbing to catastrophic culture-shock
          and unmanageable friction? When examined from a broader perspective,
          however, such alarmism is far less than fully warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For better or for worse, the over-arching cultural continuity of the
          coming shift is ensured by the profound kinship tying Marxism into the
          broad family of Abrahamic belief systems. Theologically rooted in the
          dialectical engagement with Judeo-Christian spirituality, initiated by
          Hegel and Feuerbach, the basic framework of Marxist thinking only
          trivially perturbs the structure of prophetic, eschatological,
          redemptive, and providential history. Its millenarian expectations are
          no more terrifying than those of Jewish and Christian apocalypticism
          before it, its prophetic certainties no more irrational, its submission
          to the iron laws of history no more constraining, and its moral
          enthusiasm no more zealous or impractical.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specter of a totalitarian Marxist resurgence in China is as
          realistic as the fear of a theocratic putsch in the United States of
          America, which is to say, it has no reality at all. In both cases,
          maturity, pluralism, and established traditions protect against the
          domination of society by any particular intolerant faction. It is
          unnecessary to be either Christian or Marxist to recognize the
          continuing world-historical momentum of a broad Abrahamic
          meta-narrative, or to accept the consistency of such large-scale social
          storytelling with the perpetual regeneration of practical impetus, or to
          see a settled, spontaneously improvised social solution – and
          incarnation of dynamic conservatism – in the enduring triangular
          stand-off between Marxist scriptures, Communist Party institutional
          traditions, and market radicalism in today’s China. As with Mead’s
          Anglospherean pluralism, the reciprocal limitations that each of these
          factions imposes on the others will inevitably disappoint many, but
          there is no reason for them to horrify anybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insofar as Mead is correct in identifying Anglosphere hegemony with the
          reign of the tripod, or the socio-cultural realization of pluralism (as
          triangular dynamic stability), the disruptive potential of emerging
          Chinese leadership should be considered as massively discounted, because
          the tripod is a Chinese native. Every temple in the country is equipped
          with a three-footed incense burner, every museum bronze collection is
          dominated by three-legged cauldrons, and each of these tripods has
          definite, explicitly conceptual cultural meaning. This is not only based
          upon the obvious practical and intuitive truth that the simplest model
          of stability comes from the tripod, but also from a recognition that
          triangular stand-off exemplifies sustainable dynamism in its elementary
          form, disintegrating the universe into strategic possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          For literary elaboration of this theme, one need only turn to the
          Romance of the Three Kingdoms, perhaps the most widely read of China’s
          four great classical novels. Its most conspicuous instantiation as
          popular entertainment is seen in the game of paper, scissors, stone,
          which dates back (at least) to the Chinese Han Dynasty (206 BC – AD
          220), when it was known as <em>shoushiling</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate expression of triangular dynamic stability, not only in
          China, but worldwide, is undoubtedly presented by the
          <em>Classic of Change</em>, the <em>Yi Jing</em>, or <em>Zhouyi</em>. It
          is upon this work of singular, inhuman genius, in which sheer arithmetic
          speaks more purely than it has ever done before or since, that all of
          China’s ceremonial bronzes, literary flights, and childhood games
          converge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the numerical system of the <em>Yi Jing</em>, the tripod finds a
          source more basic than the Abrahamic meta-tradition can provide,
          regardless of how Trinitarian this latter has become. That is because,
          in this Chinese cultural ur-stratum, unity does not figure as an
          original unity, subsequently disintegrated into a theological,
          dialectical, or sociopolitical triangle but is, on the contrary,
          derived. As the Confucian commentary explains: “The number 3 was
          assigned to heaven, 2 to earth, and from these came the (other)
          numbers.” <em>In the beginning were numbers</em> – primordial
          dispersion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ‘language’ of the tripod finds its most convenient expression in the
          trigram, whose three lines constitute an elementary unit. To grasp the
          <em>Yi Jing</em> as a complete arithmetical model of the
          <em>dynamic</em> triad, however, it is necessary to proceed immediately
          to the structure of the hexagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grasped <em>in operation</em>, the <em>Yi Jing</em> is not only a binary
          arithmetical system (as Leibniz interpreted it), but a bino-decimal
          conjunction. This is demonstrated by the fact that it systematically
          rewards the application of decimal digital reduction, and reveals its
          dynamic pattern only under these conditions. (This might, quite
          reasonably, be considered a highly surprising suggestion, since digital
          reduction – as it arose within the history of Western Qabbalism – seems
          to have been generated, automatically, from the interference of the
          decimal Hindu numerals with older alphabetical number systems, or
          ‘gematrias’, that attached cardinal values to specific letters, without
          use of place value. It is immediately obvious that this historical
          account cannot be translated into a Chinese context, where alphabets
          have no traditional root.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital reduction is an extremely simple numerical technique, involving
          nothing besides single-digit additions and neglect of decimal magnitude.
          A multi-digit number is treated as a string of single digit additions,
          and the process is reiterated in the case of a multi-digit result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing the series of binary powers in decimal notation yields the
          familiar sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048,
          4096, 8192 … When this series is compressed to a string of single digits
          by reduction, it proceeds: 1, 2, 4, 8, (1 + 6 =) 7, (3 + 2 =) 5, (6 + 4
          =) 1, (1 + 2 + 8 = 11 = 1 + 1 =) 2, (2 + 5 + 6 = 13 = 1 + 3 =) 4, (5 + 1
          + 2 =) 8, (1 + 0 + 2 + 4 =) 7, (2 + 0 + 4 + 8 = 14 = 1 + 4 =) 5, and
          repeatedly, through the 6-step cycle 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5. This process
          exposes the arithmetical necessity of the <em>Yi Jing</em> hexagram, as
          an archetypal exhaustion of the phases of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          To excavate the triadic or tripodic, it is helpful to turn to the
          classical (and now integral) Confucian commentary, the ‘Ten Wings’ (<em>Shi Yi</em>), which explore the
          structure
          of the trigrams and hexagrams in various
          ways. These include an explicit formula for folding the six lines of the
          hexagram back into a triad, by coupling the lines: first and fourth;
          second and fifth; third and sixth. These dyads have a consistent
          arithmetical order, when calculated in accordance with the reduced
          bino-decimal values generated above: 1 + 8 = 9; 2 + 7 = 9; 4 + 5 = 9.
          “What these six lines show is simply this, the way of the three Powers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Summation to nine regularly serves as a confirmation within the
          <em>Shi Yi</em>. For instance, in the section translated by Legge as
          ‘The Great Appendix’:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>52. The numbers (required) for Khien (or the undivided line) amount
              to 216; those for Khwan (or the divided line), to 144. Together they
              are 360, corresponding to the days of the year.</em><br />
            <em>53. The number produced by the lines in the two parts (of the Yî)
              amount to 11,520, corresponding to the number of all things.</em><br />
            <em>54. Therefore by means of the four operations is the Yî completed.
              It takes 18 changes to form a hexagram.</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>144 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9</p>
        <p>216 = 2 + 1 + 6 = 9</p>
        <p>360 = 3 + 6 + 0 = 9</p>
        <p>11,520 = 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 = 9</p>
        <p>18 = 1 + 8 = 9</p>
        <p>
          There is much more to say on the importance of the number nine in
          traditional Chinese culture, and beyond, but this is not the time. For
          now, it suffices to note that nine, or ‘Old Yang’, represents the
          extreme point of maturity or positive accumulation in the
          <em>Yi Jing</em>, and thus incipient transition. It thus echoes the
          function of the same numeral within a zero-based decimal place-value
          system, strongly reinforcing the impression that the
          <em>Yi Jing</em> assumes cultural familiarity with such numeracy, and
          thus indicating its extreme antiquity within China.
        </p>
        <p>
          The six-phase cycle collapses into a triadic dynamic, whose stages are
          the dyads 1&amp;8, 2&amp;7, 4&amp;5. It is thus exactly isomorphic with
          the paper, scissors, stone circuit, or rather, this latter can be seen
          as a simplification of the <em>Yi Jing</em> dynamic tripod, treating
          each stage as simple, rather than twinned. Where the <em>bagua</em>, or
          set of trigrams, merely enumerates the set of 3-bit variants in static
          fashion, the system of hexagrams rigorously constructs a triangular
          dynamic, which is presented as a model of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this is the ‘Chinese example’ at its most quintessential, then it is
          exactly the Anglosphere example, as determined by Mead, except carried
          to a far more exalted level of abstraction, or proto-conceptual purity.
          Dynamic pluralism is under no threat from a Chinese future, insofar as
          deep-cultural evidence counts for anything. The reign of the tripod has
          scarcely begun.

          The Mandate of Heaven (天命) belongs indisputably amongst the most
          ancient and conceptually richest political ideas. Dating back to the
          transition from the Shang to Zhou dynasties, over three millennia ago,
          it refounds the legitimacy of government in a
          <em>conditional natural right</em> (in contrast to the unconditional
          natural right asserted by the supplanted rulers of the Shang, and by
          divine right theorists in the occidental world).
          <em>Tianming</em> invests regimes whose <em>performance</em> expresses
          virtuous capability. Legitimacy is not, therefore, a formal endowment,
          but a substantial discovery, demonstrated through the art of government.
        </p>
        <p>
          The claim that <em>Tianming</em> amounts to a realistic theory of
          political legitimacy requires far more support than this tentative short
          post will offer. In particular, it has to be defended against the
          objection that <em>Tianming</em> reverts to a tautology, either
          empirically or logically (or both). The Mandate of Heaven might be
          formulated: <em>For so long as a regime succeeds it will endure</em>. 
          Is this not, from the perspective of empirical history, an empty
          retrospective judgment, or sheer redundancy, and under logical
          consideration, a thinly disguised pleonasm?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em><span id="more-82"></span>Tianming</em> could be dismissed on these
          grounds if its negation were inconceivable. Then, indeed, it would
          communicate no information. Yet this is not at all the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most relevant evidence for this is the provocative thesis
          found in Alexis de Tocqueville’s
          <em>L’ancien régime et la Révolution</em> that the successful promotion
          of social development is more threatening to regime stability than the
          complete absence of such achievement. This is an argument widely
          <a
            href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2012/10/12/democracy-china-popularity-alexis-de-tocqueville-middle-kingdom">discussed</a>
          in China today, for obvious reasons. If it holds true, the idea of
          <em>Tianming</em> — in anything other than its shallowest and most
          sophistical sense — is directly contradicted, in theory and fact.
          Reciprocally, it has to be acknowledged that the idea of
          <em>Tianming</em> poses an implicit challenge to the Tocqueville thesis,
          subject to confirmation or disconfirmation by historical events. The
          stakes of this (yet inarticulate?) controversy could scarcely be higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          An intriguing reflexivity enters into the topic at this point, because
          the conditions for the confirmation of <em>Tianming</em> are related,
          through intricate nonlinearities, to the prospects of the PRC regime. Is
          development success rewarded or punished by ‘heaven’ (the nature of
          things)? If the latter, dialectical ruin ensues, as the high are brought
          low. If the former, economic ascent and political stability will have
          demonstrated their compatibility, revolutionary chaos will be precluded,
          and the rebalancing of the world order towards the western Pacific will
          continue. Under such conditions, there is every reason to expect that
          global trends will be incrementally ‘Confucianized’ with international
          political thinking increasingly inflected by Chinese characteristics.
          Simultaneously vindicated and promoted, the idea of
          <em>Tianming</em> will then find a wider receptive audience than it has
          ever known before.

          oscillation is remarkable, he finds the bipolar syndrome itself to be
          notably stable across time. The upswing — Wasserstrom suggests — is
          associated with hopes that ‘they’ are becoming more like ‘us’, but on
          the downswing:

          <em>… when the Western China Nightmare is dominant, the risk is that
            observers and the general public lose sight of how varied the Chinese
            populace is and instead grow accustomed to demonised images of China …
            filled not with flesh-and-blood Chinese individuals but a horde of
            soulless mannequins. […] Stories that dehumanise China’s population
            tout court are also periodically published, though only rarely do they
            do so as overtly as a 1999 Weekly Standard article which described the

          When calmly dissected and investigated, durable stereotypes usually have
          something significant to say, about both their subjects and their

          cultural explorers, and the importance of understanding it is only going
          to grow. <em>Urban Future</em> will be bringing sustained attention to

          Somewhere deep in the task-queue here (at UF) is a post, or article,
          exploring the resonances between phobic Occidental responses to

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Last week, the giant Chinese internet and gaming company Tencent
            published an article on its news portal about the rising price of
            consumer goods in China – not exactly earth-shattering news, except
            that the article was written by a robot called
            <a href="http://finance.qq.com/a/20150910/019573.htm">Dreamwriter</a>.
            […] Dreamwriter wrote the 1000-word article, using algorithms that
            search online sources and data, in just 60 seconds. The article quoted
            economists and highlighted trends in a style indistinguishable from a
            human financial reporter. […] According to the
            <a
              href="http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/1857196/end-road-journalists-robot-reporter-dreamwriter-chinas-tencent">South
              China Morning Post</a>, Dreamwriter’s article was the first robot-written news article in
            the Chinese language.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>The Morning Post quoted a Chinese journalist who said China’s
            state-run media doesn’t give reporters much creative license, which
            makes them easily replaceable by robot writers: “You know, many
            reporters working for government-run newspapers across the country
            usually copy and paste the statements and news press. They are not
            allowed to express doubt or really investigate reports against the
            authorities. So robot reporters could easily replace a lot of Chinese
            reporters like this nationwide.”</em>

          Zachary Keck is
          <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/chinese-dont-believe-theyre-being-watched-and-censored/">bemused</a>
          by the findings of a recent Global Scan poll that finds broad Chinese
          satisfaction with the country’s media and surveillance environment.
          Among the findings, 76% of Chinese feel “free of surveillance” compared
          with only 54% of Americans. To the extent that oppression can be
          subjectively evaluated, Chinese ‘totalitarian communism’ isn’t doing it
          very well.
        </p>
        <p>
          There might be some way to mine into this information rigorously, but
          that’s beyond the scope of the discussion so far. Keck muses about the
          possibility that the Edward Snowden leaks have soured Western opinion,
          while “it’s hard to know how much of the views can be attributed to
          different expectations Chinese have about freedom when compared to their
          counterparts in democratic countries, and how much of their answers are
          attributable to general ignorance about the Chinese government’s
          surveillance and censorship. I suspect both factors probably play a role
          but that the former is likely more important.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-383"></span>An alternative explanation is that Western
          cultures have developed in a way that sanctifies dissent, and finds the
          exemplification of freedom in the act or expression of defiance. The
          alternative, Chinese assumption, that freedom is mostly about being left
          alone, is classically captured by the proverb “The mountains are high,
          and the Emperor is far away” (山高皇帝远). Unsurprisingly, this saying
          is thought to have originated in entrepreneurial Zhejiang Province
          (perhaps the most civilized place in the world).
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would anybody but an idiot go looking for the emperor simply to poke
          a finger in his eye? Don’t do anything like that, and there’s not much
          chance of encountering oppression. Some flaky Internet connectivity
          doesn’t feel like a “a boot stamping on a human face —
          <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">forever</a>.” It feels like a minor inconvenience.
          At
          least, that’s what the poll
          evidence suggests.

        </p>
        <p>Explanation at the original site:</p>
        <p>
          <em>Not religious, in this sense, is everyone who is left over when you
            have counted adherents. The World Christian Database, on which the
            data is based, use the term ‘nonreligionists’ and defines it as ‘ …
            encompassing the 2 varieties of unbeliever: (a) agnostics or
            secularists or materialists, who are nonreligious but not hostile to
            religion, and (b) atheists or anti-religious/anti-religionists opposed
            or hostile to religion.’</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Territory size shows the proportion of people who are not religious
              living there</strong>.</em>
          [Absolute numbers seem not to be a factor.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after this gloss, ‘not religious’ is a dubious category, which
          tends to be defined in terms of Western (Abrahamic-Theistic) norms. (Is
          Chinese medicine, for example, in any serious way ‘non-religious’?)
          Nevertheless, the distribution is striking. Any conception of China’s
          rise (and it’s probable world cultural impact) is going to be missing
          something important if it neglects what is really jutting through here.

          the Chinese crackdown on Church of the Almighty God (also known as
          Eastern Lightning) after a recruiting operation turned murderous. The
          general background is most probably familiar, but it’s important enough
          to run through again:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The strong Chinese reaction against splinter groups — in this case,
            five death sentences—sometimes surprises Western observers, but we
            only need to look to China’s history to see why such groups give
            Beijing officials the willies. In the 19th-century, the catastrophic
            Taiping Rebellion involved a group not wholly unlike the Church of the
            Almighty God. In that rebellion a millenarian sect lead by Hong
            Xiuquan claiming to be the younger brother of Jesus, rose up against
            the Qing dynasty. At least twenty million people died in the ensuing
            conflict.
          </em>
        </p>
        <em>
          <p>
            Eastern Lightning, like its Taiping predecessor, grounds itself in
            Christian texts and ideas. The “god” now born as a woman to bring the
            apocalypse is seen by the sect as the third in a series: Yahweh, who
            gave the Old Testament; Jesus who came to save humanity and now the
            third has come to judge the human race and bring the end of the world.
            The rapid growth of this movement shows the degree to which many
            Chinese feel alienated from the official ideology, the appeal of
            Christian messages in China, and the sense of popular unease as China
            changes rapidly. There is nothing here to make Beijing feel good.
          </p>
        </em>
        <p>
          <em>There’s another reason that the rise of an apocalyptic cult would be
            of such concern. China’s long history of rising and falling dynasties
            has given rise to a school of historical analysis that looks for
            patterns in Chinese history. This approach, shared by many ordinary
            people and many distinguished Chinese intellectuals down through the
            ages, seeks to identify recurring features of the decline and fall
            phase of a dynasty’s cycle. The rise of apocalyptic religious cults is
            one of the classic signs of dynastic decadence, as is the rise of a
            pervasive culture of corruption among officials and the spread of
            local unrest.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the 18th century, the divorce of theological innovation from
          social revolution in Occidental public consciousness has pushed the
          religious question — originally identical with
          <em><a href="http://blog.jim.com/war/hong-kong-government-needs-an-inquisition/">tolerance</a></em>
          — into ever deeper eclipse. Until very recently, within the West, any
          attribution of genuine political consequence to such matters had seemed
          no more than eccentric anachronism, although this situation is quite
          rapidly
          <a href="http://www.popehat.com/2014/10/10/strange-seeds-on-distant-shores/">changing</a>. Elsewhere in the
          world,
          religious issues retained far greater
          socio-political pertinence, largely because the common millenarian
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom">root</a>
          of enthusiasm and rebellion had not been effaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible that the Chinese approach to
          <a
            href="http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/10/12/3579154/why-christians-are-helping-lead-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-movement/">dissident</a>

          remains ‘strange’ to many in the West. There can surely be little doubt,
          however, that whatever convergence takes place will tend to a
          traditional Chinese understanding far more than a contemporary

          real force. Of course, there are a great many other dynamic tangles at

            Islamic values for the sake of multiculturalism”; they believe in the
            welfare state that “benefits only the idle and the free riders”; they

      <h5><em>A new world order hits the buffers</em></h5>
      <p>
        “For nearly 30 years we have had two Global Strategies working in a
        symbiotic fashion that has created a virtuous economic growth spiral.
        Unfortunately, the economic underpinnings were flawed and as a
        consequence, the virtuous cycle has ended. It is now in the process of
        reversing and becoming a vicious downward economic spiral,”
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-economic-death-spiral-has-been-triggered"
          target="_blank">writes</a>
        Gordon T. Long, in a guest post at Zero Hedge. “One of the strategies is
        the Asian Mercantile Strategy. The other is the US Dollar Reserve
        Currency Strategy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The system that Long sees unraveling has been
        <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5424112/The-trillion-dollar-question-China-or-America.html"
          target="_blank">dubbed</a>
        ‘Chimerica’ by Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick, in reference to the
        mythical hybrid beast of antiquity. Chimerica emerged through the
        dynamic coupling of the US and Chinese economies, dominating the wave of
        globalization in the post-command economy world. It has served as a
        powerful engine of development, spreading prosperity beyond the narrow
        enclave of the (Euro-American) ‘First World’ and facilitating the global
        roll-out of digital network technologies, from personal computing and
        mobile telephony to the Internet. In recent years, however, its
        unsustainable features have become prominently visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripped to its fundamentals, Chimerica amounted to something akin to an
        informal geopolitical ‘deal’ that simultaneously promoted the
        international status of the US Dollar and domestic Chinese
        industrialization. The principal financial mechanism was the recycling
        of Chinese trade surpluses into US Treasury Bonds, in a process that
        accentuated Chinese competitiveness (by restraining the rise of the
        Yuan) and suppressed US inflation (preserving the credibility of the
        USD). This enabled Chinese industrial expansion to proceed at a far
        greater speed than its domestic market could have supported, whilst
        providing US governments with the latitude to run a chronically loose
        monetary policy immunized against the prospect of currency collapse. The
        Chinese manufacturing and US banking sectors were the most obvious
        beneficiaries. Both prospered conspicuously.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Niall Ferguson
        <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111601736.html"
          target="_blank">wrote</a>
        in November 2008, in the early days of the world financial crisis:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “At the heart of this crisis is the huge imbalance between the United
          States, with its current account deficit in excess of 1 percent of
          world gross domestic product, and the surplus countries that finance
          it: the oil exporters, Japan and emerging Asia. Of these, the
          relationship between China and America has become the crucial one.
          More than anything else, it has been China’s strategy of dollar
          reserve accumulation that has financed America’s debt habit. Chinese
          savings were a key reason U.S. long-term interest rates stayed low and
          the borrowing binge kept going. Now that the age of leverage is over,
          ‘Chimerica’ — the partnership between the big saver and the big
          spender — is key.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Having reached a state of crisis, Chimerica seems certain to unwind.
        This might occur either through a measured rebalancing that increases
        Chinese domestic consumption whilst reducing US deficit spending, or as
        a messy disintegration — involving sudden demand contraction, currency
        wars, and escalating mutual recrimination. Whatever the eventual
        outcome, a refashioned world order is an inevitable – which is to say,
        definitional – result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst Ferguson hedges his
        <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=533" target="_blank">bets</a>, Gordon Long
        spells
        out a specific and ominous forecast, in which the
        virtuous cycle of Chimerican globalization reverses into a vicious
        ‘death spiral’. As ‘<a href="http://www.gordontlong.com/disclosure.asp?dest=art-2011-04-ds" target="_blank">debt
          saturation</a>’ closes down the option of policy continuity, the actions of the US
        Federal Reserve become manifestly ineffective, self-contradictory, and
        ultimately paralyzed. The long-postponed process of currency destruction
        then begins in earnest. Long offers a useful checklist of milestones on
        the road to ruin (proceeding from financial, through economic, to
        political calamity):
      </p>
      <p><em>1. A deteriorating US dollar</em></p>
      <p><em>2. Rising US interest rates</em></p>
      <p><em>3. Sustained and chronic US unemployment</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>4. Asian inflation, especially in food where 60% of Asian disposable
          income is spent</em>
      </p>
      <p><em>5. Pressures on Asian currency pegs</em></p>
      <p><em>6. Collapsing values of US Reserve holdings</em></p>
      <p>
        By the end of this process, the world will have been violently
        catapulted out of a financial architecture dating back 70 years, and a
        dominant monetary philosophy that has prevailed over the course of
        centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The eventuality of a fiat currency crisis is ordained and has been
        since the early warnings in 2007 of the Financial Crisis,” Long insists.
        “The roadmap has been clear to all that actually wanted to look.”

        Handle’s
        <a
          href="http://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/review-of-the-rise-of-china-vs-the-logic-of-strategy-by-edward-luttwak/">epic</a>
        walk-through of Edward Luttwak on the rise of China is simply
        magnificent. If the Chinese foreign policy establishment doesn’t put it
        on a study list, the world is a more dangerous place than it needs to
        be. It says impressive things about Luttwak that his work is able to
        prompt commentary of such astounding quality. (Yes, it’s long, but you
        have to read it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Sinophile, and even (far more reservedly) a sympathizer with the
        post-Mao PRC regime, it’s disturbing to me how convincing I find this
        analysis. China really could blow itself up, along with a big chunk of
        the world’s sole truly dynamic region, by mis-playing its excellent
        foreign policy hand (in pretty much exactly the way Handle lays out). In
        particular, its ability to avoid the disastrous course of Germany’s rise
        is the most pressing question of the age, and the signs so far are
        <a href="http://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2013/11/china-attacks/">not</a>
        remotely encouraging. Having dug itself quite unnecessarily into a trap
        of increasingly embittered anti-China balancing, 2013 looks very clearly
        to have been the worst year since the beginning of Reform and Opening
        for Chinese geo-strategic decision making.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1808"></span>Reversing course is hard. The important
        thing for the Chinese leadership to understand is that challenges to
        global hegemony are almost inevitably catastrophic. There has not been a
        single case in modern history where such a transition has succeeded,
        except through close strategic alignment with the preceding hegemon.
        Holland passed the torch to the UK, which passed it on in turn to the
        USA. If China envisages an alternative path for itself — rooted in basic
        antagonism — it is shelving the lessons of modernity, and turning to
        something else, where ancient cycles lose themselves in the fog-banks of
        myth. Such deep historical precedent is far too poorly understood to
        offer anything like helpful advice. The atavistic popular feeling it
        rouses, however, is certainly strong enough to drive developments over a
        cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
        US global hegemony has lost the Mandate of Heaven. The only way it could
        trawl it back is through the unforced errors of its enemies — which is
        to say, those who have blundered into being positioned as its enemies.
        On present trends, these foul-ups are all-too-likely to be made. That
        would mean world war, naturally tending to thermonuclear ruin, and the
        end of civilization. China would be finished as anything beyond a broken
        warning about what non-submission to the democratic
        <em>zeitgeist</em> leads to (having done to political sanity what
        Germany did to bio-realism). Through this climax of idiocy, the human
        species would have melodramatically disqualified itself from any
        significant historical agency going forward. Military robotics (aka
        ‘Skynet’, emerging from the war) would be the only intelligent prospect
        left.

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Economics is complicated, but at least in certain respects it’s not
        <i>that</i> complicated. Chart almost any market-sensitive variable and
        what emerges is a wave pattern, varying in amplitude, frequency, and
        trend, but clearly conforming to a general pattern, mixing an irregular
        rhythm with a random walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The irregularity and randomness are predicated by elementary economic
        theory, since determinism and regularity are strictly equivalent to bank
        notes lying on the street, no sooner glimpsed than seized. Zero-risk
        speculative opportunities – of the kind any intelligible pattern
        presents – are quickly arbitraged back to noise, the equilibrium state,
        in which all significant information is absorbed into price.
      </p>
      <p>
        The residual rhythm is more unexpected, and attests to an irrational
        factor, stimulating intellectual and practical controversy. Regardless
        of such disputes, it is possible to be confident about two indefinite
        points. Firstly, market rhythms are (almost) never easy to accurately
        predict, and thus exploit. Secondly, off-trend deviations will
        eventually be corrected, unless – very rarely – the trend itself changes
        shape. The qualification of the second point deserves special
        examination, because unrealistic expectations concerning trend-line
        transformations lie at the root of the most notorious error in practical
        economic reasoning – the belief (typically hardening in direct
        proportion to the inflation of a bubble) that “this time is different.”
        This slogan, which encapsulates the stubborn and disastrously expensive
        syndrome of <i>downwards correction denial</i>, should be written on the
        shirts of those who will soon be losing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-66"></span>Any market wave of sufficient amplitude crests
        in a bubble, which ‘pops’ in a crash. Unless
        <i>this time is different</i> – and it won’t be – China will inevitably
        experience such an event. Speculative commentary on the nature and
        timing of this event has increased markedly in volume as the global
        economic environment has deteriorated. Yet prediction is especially
        difficult in this case. China’s market economy is just a little over
        three decades old, with only occasional rough patches interrupting
        near-continuous, rapid growth. Disentangling the unsustainable component
        or rhythmic upswing from the underlying development path involves
        unusually hazy estimation, given the incompleteness of the pattern
        perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an article published in
        <a href="http://english.caixin.com/2013-07-29/100561990.html?p1">Caixin</a>
        and
        <a
          href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/preparing-for-china-bubbles-to-burst-andy-xie-2013-07-29?link=MW_story_popular">Marketwatch</a>
        (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-31/guest-post-china%E2%80%99s-housing-living-n-bubble">via</a>),
        Andy Xie makes a substantial contribution to this discussion. He
        identifies China’s financial vulnerability with a massive asset bubble
        in the property market, but remains sanguine about its ultimate
        consequences. He argues persuasively that a very substantial write-down
        of real estate values, although inevitably disruptive, would have a
        tonic effect on the Chinese economy almost immediately, with fast
        recovery to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because China’s market economy does not yet have an identifiable
        long-term trend, Xie estimates the scale of the country’s property
        bubble by comparing the appreciation of real estate prices to wage
        growth:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>China has experienced rapid increase in land prices in the past
          decade. Some of it can be justified by income and productivity growth
          due to the country joining the World Trade Organization. Most of the
          increase is a bubble phenomenon.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While household income may have tripled in a decade, the average land
          price has risen by over thirty times. Whatever income growth is to
          come cannot justify the current price of land. Nor can a supply
          shortage.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>China has no shortage of land. High-rise urbanization makes demand
          for land quite low relative to the population. The sustainable land
          value is probably 70% to 80% below current levels.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of the property market in contemporary Chinese social life is a
        topic of widespread interest, both inside and outside the country.
        Because marriage prospects (for men) are tightly bound to their ability
        to provide a home, some very deeply-rooted Darwinian forces are
        harnessed to the appreciation of property values, making them an
        overwhelmingly dominant factor in economic life. For this reason, among
        others, a real estate crash that brought prices down to somewhere
        between a third and a fifth of their current level promises to be
        traumatizing and liberating in equal measure.

        realistically possible:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some argue that the property bubble is essential to China’s economic
          prosperity. This is utter nonsense. While the property industry has
          become bigger relative to the economy over the past decade, it mostly
          consumes resources and doesn’t enhance overall productivity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is the main driver for China’s inflation. If it shrinks, the
          economy may suffer temporarily. However, overall productivity will
          rise. The resulting income growth will bring back more sustainable
          economic prosperity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, a bubble bursts sooner or later. Government help merely
          prolongs it, as the Chinese government did in 2008. And the longer a
          bubble lasts, the more damage it inflicts upon bursting. The economy
          is suffering because of what happened in 2008.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The country has sufficient capacity to absorb whatever non-performing
          loans may come out of this bubble bursting. It could be 20 trillion to
          30 trillion yuan ($3.26 trillion-$4.89 trillion). But the waste in the
          bubble economy could have been 5 trillion yuan.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>China could overcome the legacy of the bubble in four to five years.
          Further, better productivity from post-bubble reforms could add
          another 2 trillion to 3 trillion yuan per annum. The post-bubble
          recovery could happen in three years.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Japan couldn’t get its economy growing after its property bubble
          burst. The main reason is that its per capita income was already among
          the highest in the world.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>China is still a middle-income economy. Improving productivity is not
          that difficult. Reaching per capita income of $20,000 by 2030,
          excluding inflation, is quite possible, which would make China the
          largest economy in the world.</em>

        a brief commentary on China’s economic policy outlook:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese
          Communist Party, currently under way in Beijing, President Xi Jinping
          is unveiling China’s reform blueprint for the next decade. In advance
          of its release, the Development Research Center of the State Council,
          China’s official think tank, presented its own reform proposal – the
          so-called “383 plan” – which offers a glimpse of the direction that
          the reforms will take.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite a keen sense of the obstacles ahead, the writers are clearly
        impressed:
      </p>
      <p data-line-id="186341aa94c04bff8047be84f617af8e">
        <em>But the kind of deep and comprehensive reforms that China needs are
          always difficult to implement, given that they necessarily affect
          vested interests. In order to win public support for reforms, thereby
          maximizing the chances of success, the government must offer clear,
          accessible explanations of its goals. … The Research Center takes a
          holistic approach to the reform process, viewing it as both a systemic
          change and a change of mindset. Translating its proposals – which are
          as profound as Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 reforms – into simple,
          straightforward terms is no easy feat, but one that the 383 plan
          handles with relative deftness.</em>

      <p data-line-id="186341aa94c04bff8047be84f617af8e">
        <span id="more-153"></span>It’s almost impossible not to read the
        comparison to the 1978 reforms as hyperbole, especially when it is
        quickly conceded that “rapid, sweeping transformation is not realistic
        in a country of 1.3 billion people.” Nevertheless, the proposed
        direction of change is clearly encouraging, most obviously because it
        seeks so unambiguously to deepen the market-oriented policy approach of
        the Reform Era, by expanding the sphere of decentralized price-sensitive
        decision making (while contracting the scope of political discretion).

          the relationships between the Chinese economy’s three main actors:
          government, business, and the market. Second, it identifies eight key
          areas of reform: governance, competition policy, land, finance, public
          finance, state assets, innovation, and liberalization of international
          trade and finance. Third, it highlights three correlated goals: easing
          external pressure for domestic policy changes, building social
          inclusiveness through a basic social-security scheme, and reducing
          inefficiency, inequality, and corruption through major rural land
          reform.</em>

        Given the near-inevitability of serious disruption in the world economy
        over the next few years, as well as some overdue bubble-popping in China
        (mostly in real estate), even a cautious crawl in the right direction
        looks attractive. Among the reasons not to rush anywhere is the
        degenerate state of monetary theory worldwide, which has lead to the
        adoption of disastrously misconceived

        Confused Westerners, wondering how the Xi-Li leadership’s quasi-Maoist

        in <em>The Diplomat</em>. Regardless of liberal assumptions to the
        contrary, enforcing Central Party discipline on China’s regional
        fiefdoms is tightly aligned with the reform agenda. (Realism in this
        regard is advanced by the acknowledgement that authoritarian
        liberalization is the only kind there has ever been, anywhere.)

        <em>Xi and the central Party’s authority over local leaders will go a
          long way toward determining the scope and extent of the economic
          reforms China undertakes in the years ahead. Xi and Li have both made
          it clear that they understand the nature of reforms China needs to
          sustain growth. Their ability to act on this understanding is a
          different matter entirely. Although they will face stiff resistance
          from many segments of society, local leaders are notable in that they
          are involved in nearly every major area of reform. […] Thus,
          overcoming local government resistance will be a crucial part of Xi’s
          ability to undertake the necessary economic reforms. Xi and the

        <em>A month ago, China overtook the US to become the largest economy in

          economy will be twice as large as America’s and larger than the
          European Union and America combined, accounting for one third of
          global GDP. This is the world that is coming into being, that we must

          we are used to, a globe dominated by the West and Japan: in the

        During the preponderant part of the modern period, China’s

        China is reaching the end of its current (post-1979) growth process,
        <a href="http://blog.mpettis.com/2014/07/bad-debt-cannot-simply-be-socialized/">argues</a>
        Michael Pettis, and the direction it takes next will be decided in large
        part by its approach to the country’s debt over-hang. Dismissing glib
        talk about a magical ‘socialization’ of the debt-<a
          href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jackperkowski/2014/01/21/chinas-debt-how-serious-is-it/">burden</a>, Pettis
        insists that the problem of assigning losses is irreducible,
        and the only serious question is where these costs will be concentrated.
        Irrespective of the specific policy mechanisms selected, there is
        essentially a three-way-option: someone has to pay, and it will either
        be the country’s households, its small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs), or
        its large state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course if the losses are assigned to the household sector, China
          cannot rebalance and it will be more than ever dependent on investment
          to drive growth. This is why I reject absolutely the argument that
          because China resolved the last banking crisis “painlessly”, it can do
          so again.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[… ] Beijing can also assign the losses to SMEs. In effect this is
          what it started to do in 2010-11 when wages rose sharply (SMEs tend to
          be labor intensive). It is widely recognized that SMEs are the most
          efficient part of the Chinese economy, however, and that assigning the
          losses to them will undermine the engine of China’s future
          productivity growth.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[…] Finally Beijing can assign the losses to the state sector, by
          reforming the houkou [sic] system, land reform, interest rate and
          currency reform, financial sector governance reform, privatization,
          etc. Most of the Third Plenum reforms are simply ways of assigning the
          cost of rebalancing, which includes the recognition of earlier losses,
          to the state sector. This is likely however to be politically
          difficult. China’s elite generally benefits tremendously from control
          of state sector assets, and they are likely to resist strongly any
          attempt to assign to them the losses.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Pettis’ (non-predictive) analysis, re-igniting Chinese
        growth in a new phase will be inseparable from an intra-establishment
        struggle over the responsibility of the SOEs to cover the legacy costs
        of the country’s economic reformation to date.
        <em>Status quo</em> resistance to this compelling developmental logic is
        sure to provide critical context for the actions of China’s new Xi-Li
        administration, as it consolidated power among unusually challenging
        circumstances.

        is hard to imagine a problem which throws economic and political agendas

          underestimate the importance of what China has achieved policy-wise

          by
          China are now emerging from post-Snowden
          discussions in proposals at the highest levels in EU countries. Russia
          has already embraced it. Of course, the US industry still need the
          myth of a “global village” to push products worldwide. Still, I am
          curious to see how it evolves as the ad market will continue to
          shrink, and as foreign relationships with the US are likely to get
          less friendly in the next years. While EU and other countries (esp in
          Africa and South America) start realizing that the US-first model of
          the Internet is too much a disadvantage for them, the only other

          in “real” terms of goods and services, China will this year produce
          $17.6 trillion — compared with $17.4 trillion for the U.S.A. […] As
          recently as 2000, [the US] produced nearly three times as much as the

        they are by no means inconsiderable.

          happens right at the start when companies raise hundreds of millions

      <h5><em>Can Expo live again?</em></h5>
      <p>
        Different truths are ‘harsh’ to different people. For Chinese, one truth
        so harsh that it escaped public recognition at the moment where it most
        mattered is that almost nobody, outside the country, cared very much
        about the 2010 World Expo. By the time China eagerly but belatedly
        seized its chance to take up the torch for this global festival of
        modern civilization, Expo’s epoch of radiant significance had passed.
        Harsher still: this was the basic fact, and principal conditioning
        reality of the event, rippling with ominous implications for the future
        of modernity and the international response to China’s re-awakening.
        Ameliorating it are more shadowy, contrary truths – first among them
        that Shanghai had already discounted a tired world’s Expo indifference,
        and worked around it, in order to make the event into an opportunity for
        something else, and for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of World Expo, from London’s Great Exhibition of 1851, is
        too abundantly documented to rehearse here. The basic pattern, however,
        is not difficult to outline, since it conforms to a relatively smooth
        curve from meteoric rise (1851-1940) into gradual decay (1958 onwards),
        almost perfectly tracking the trajectory of modernist optimism, from its
        ignition in the promethean forge of industrial revolution through to its
        expiry in postmodern / postcolonial cynicism, elite masochism, and
        apologia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Importantly, this has remained an essentially Western story, despite the
        consistent globalism of its cultural ambitions. The ascent of Western,
        globalizing, industrial capitalism, in its European and American waves,
        was reflected in World Exhibitions of heart-stopping glory. The crisis
        and decline of the West – both relative and absolute — has thrown the
        event into marginality, neglect, and self-doubt, clasped in the
        death-grip of an embittered and self-mortifying anti-modernism. Most
        crucially — and astoundingly — the long-evident dawning of the
        historical revitalizing and frenetically modernizing ‘Asian Century’
        seems to have had a negligible impact upon the declinist ‘Grand
        Narrative’ incarnated in World Expo, which has plunged ever deeper into
        twitchily gesticulating, hypersensitive panic at the supposed social and
        environmental calamity of modernistic growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The irony of this situation merits explicit emphasis. Precisely when
        globalization shifted from questionable aspiration and ideology to
        definite historical fact, with the emergence of robust, non-Western
        economic development cores, first in Pacific East Asia, then South Asia,
        and beyond, the project of cosmopolitan modernization underwent a
        seemingly irremediable delegitimation in the court of approved ‘world’
        opinion. Apparently, if the West cannot any longer strut across the
        world stage with invincible and unchallenged confidence, the only
        acceptable alternative option is hair-shirts for all. If this epitome of
        triumphant dog-in-the-manger resentment does not exemplify ‘cultural
        hegemony’ at its most potent and most toxic, it is hard to imagine what
        might.
      </p>
      <p>
        An overwhelming abundance of public evidence attests to the implacable
        momentum of Expo degeneration, although most of this data resists tidy
        quantification. Since the end of World War II, the original purpose of
        the event, which was to promote industrial modernization worldwide
        through a comprehensive public exhibition of advanced productive
        technologies, structural engineering, manufactures, and commodities, has
        been progressively phased-out, to be replaced by an agenda that reflects
        the concerns of inter-governmental bureaucracies, national diplomatic
        services, and tourism boards. Public relations displays have been
        systematically substituted for technological exhibitions, and the number
        of significant mechanical and product innovations achieving popular
        exposure through Expo – once substantial — has fallen to near-zero. Expo
        themes have been steadily stripped of their associations with
        accumulative materialism and refashioned into earnest exhortations for
        moral and social transformation, as an event that was initially designed
        to celebrate modernity has increasingly come to apologize for it.
        Predictably enough, this bureaucratically-alchemized transmutation of a
        festival into lament has been accompanied by a precipitous collapse of
        popular interest and engagement. Audiences that once flooded in to catch
        a vision of the future, now avoid an event that musters all the allure
        of a United Nations teach-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the West, this is all tediously familiar. Scarcely anyone pays
        attention to Expo anymore, or cares much about it. Perhaps most, if
        jolted into an opinion on the matter, would vaguely approve of the
        politically correct course the event has taken, although not
        sufficiently, of course, to ever entertain the prospect of attending
        one. After all, few Westerners believe in modernity anymore, world
        trends distress them, and Expo seems roughly as relevant to their
        anxieties as the prospect of Mars colonization.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the East, things are more puzzling. Societies undergoing rapid
        modernistic development make natural Expo hosts, as demonstrated
        consistently throughout the history of the event. There has never been a
        great World Expo that has not broadly corresponded to a moment of
        exceptional national and urban flourishing. Why, then, has Expo not
        undergone a profound Asiatic revitalization, restoring it to former
        glories? Why has the western Pacific Rim not captured Expo, re-tooling
        it into a promotional vehicle for its own developmental prospects, as
        America did in the early 20th century?
      </p>
      <p>
        Weighed by sheer visitor numbers, the two largest World Expos in history
        have been East Asian. Yet the moribund, guilt-wracked pathos of
        Occidental decline continues to dominate the event. Japan spent its Expo
        1970 attempting to prove that it could out-do even the West in
        growth-sapping sanctimoniousness (as its economy would later
        demonstrate), whilst the mood in post-Expo 2010 Shanghai seems
        remarkably devoid of any euphoric sense of accomplishment, and more akin
        to that which might be expected from a group of schoolchildren freshly
        escaped from an abnormally-uninspired six-month lecture on
        ethically-guided behavioral rectification, delivered by an international
        Mandarinate. Having just executed the largest discrete event in human
        history, the predominant feelings are dutiful relief and anticlimax,
        numbed by something like deliberate amnesia. In any case, there’s
        Shanghai to get on with, so why waste time remembering Expo? Doesn’t
        that just stink up the joint with the odor of Western death?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Some suggestions, tentative answers, still more downside, and a lot
        more upside, to come.)

      <h5><em>Expo transformers – the uninvited guests</em></h5>
      <p>
        What was inside the UK national pavilion at Expo 2010? Did anyone get in
        there? Maybe they could pass on the inside dope? Because one thing is
        for sure, if ‘Anglosphere’ cultural resonances mean anything,
        expectations can be pitched down to sub-basement levels. Like the UK,
        Australia did a good — even excellent job – with the outside of its
        pavilion, but its exhibition was, to be brutally frank, a disgrace.
        Vacuous, patronizing, revoltingly sentimental, and despicably cowardly –
        details would be nice, of course, but actually there weren’t any — it
        served to perfectly illustrate the collapse of Expo, from a festival of
        dynamic modernization to a whining indulgence in modernity’s most
        destructive cultural pathologies. Where once an exhibition, whether
        corporate or national, boldly declared: “This is what we’re doing (isn’t
        it magnificent?),” now they exhaust their attenuated energies exploring
        new, although consistently unimaginative, ways of saying “sorry.”
        Narcissistic guilt flaps pointlessly about the exhibition space like a
        shoal of stranded fish, dying on a beach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incredibly, the USA pavilion was even worse. Not only was the pavilion
        itself a prefabricated strip-mall insult, unworthy of comparison with a
        second-tier Wallmart, but the exhibition inside took the obsequious
        pandering of the Australians to a whole new level. We wanted a space
        shuttle or a predator drone and they gave us Hillary Clinton saying “<em>ni hao</em>” plus some nonsense about
        planting flower-beds in the ghetto. Anyone
        who left this pavilion without deep and abiding detestation for
        everything America represented itself as being probably thinks Barney is
        a pretty cool guy. This was the society once capable of staging the
        Chicago Expo of 1893, the New York Expos of 1939-40 and 1964-5, of
        making incredible things and exhibiting them, of depicting a compelling
        vision of the future, and now … morbid Spenglerian reflections were
        inescapable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wandering amongst these monuments to misdirection, bland
        meaninglessness, sugary PR, and piteous ‘please-don’t-hate-me’
        concessions to the strident anti-modernist moralism of the age – which
        is to say, to sheer, ruinous decadence — consciousness pixilated out
        into semi-random dot-pattern, swirled kaleidoscopically by a storm of
        frustration that could only be relieved by barking out at the local Expo
        authorities, and beyond them at the city, country, and region that was
        hosting this event “Could you <em>please</em> stop being so danged
        polite!”
      </p>
      <p>
        The West is obviously spiraling down the drain, and what it needs, above
        anything, is some inspiring competition. In particular, and in 2010, it
        needed a western Pacific Rim, full-throttle development,
        blazing-a-path-to-the-future Expo that – purely by inevitable
        implication – maximized the humiliation of the senescent ‘developed’
        world and jolted it with the roughest imaginable type of
        <em>tough love</em> from its path of decline. (Of course, the societies
        most in need of this shock therapy are too lost in the enthralling
        minutiae of their own degeneration to have noticed it, but still …)
        Instead, Expo 2010 remained scrupulously courteous, deferential to
        deeply decayed Expo traditions, and respectful of the multicultural
        piety that even the most wretched examples of systematic social failure
        have a dignity of their own. What it lacked was a massive injection of
        pure, unselfconscious, ethno-historical arrogance, based on unmoderated
        confidence in what was being achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps this can be stated even more offensively: modernization should
        make people feel bad. Its most altruistic or epidemic function is to so
        thoroughly deride and humiliate all of those who are failing to
        modernize that eventually, after every excuse and projection has been
        attempted and exhausted, <em>behavior is changed</em>. Backwardness is
        made shameful, and thus corrected. That’s how history works. It began
        that way among the jig-saw principalities of Renaissance Europe, it
        worked that way in Japan (bringing modernization with the Meiji
        restoration), in China, long denigrated for its ‘stagnant Confucianism’,
        now big mummy of the Dragon economies, in India, finally lashed
        psychologically out of its absurd ‘Hindu rate of growth’ by the China
        model, and everywhere else that has ever climbed out of complacent sloth
        onto the developmental fast track. It’s long overdue to start happening
        in the West, because what has been happening there — for the best part
        of a century now — simply isn’t working, and this chronic social failure
        is nowhere near clear, painful, or embarrassing enough to the
        populations concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing would be better for the West than to have its nose rubbed in its
        own decay, the more abusively and insensitively the better. In order to
        accelerate the process, the entire treasure chest of colonial
        condescension should be re-opened and rummaged through, searching for
        whatever will best aggravate, provoke, and catalyze transformation,
        perhaps with strong insinuations of racial and cultural inferiority
        thrown in for spice. The lesson of history is that the human species is
        comfortable with inertia, and generally more than happy to gradually
        degenerate. One of the few things that ever stops people, and turns them
        around, is the transparent contempt trickling down from other, more
        dynamic societies. If Expo needs a ‘social dimension’, that’s it.
      </p>
      <p>
        No doubt 2010 is still too recent for alternative or counter-factual
        history, for an Expo-punk (or X-punk) genre, searching out everything
        that might have been re-animated through the event — but the venture is
        irresistible. Call it <em>Asia Unleashed 2010</em>, an utterly impolite
        assertion of new socio-geographical realities that expresses, in raw and
        overwhelming style, the central truth of the age: the simultaneous
        de-westernization and radical re-invigoration of modernity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Asia Unleashed</em> could have borrowed heavily from the actual Expo
        2010, adopting almost everything that was created by the host, in fact,
        and much else beside. The China Pavilion, Theme Pavilions, Urban Best
        Practices Area, Expo Cultural Center, Expo Center, Expo Boulevard, Expo
        Museum, and site landscaping, as well as the Shipping Pavilion, GM/SAIC
        Pavilion and exhibition, Telecoms Pavilion, Oil Pavilion, Shanghai
        Corporate Pavilion with all its stuff, Coca Cola Pavilion, plenty of the
        international pavilion designs, and even a few of the internal
        exhibitions … all keepers. What gets laughed out are the schmaltzy
        public relations videos, the
        <em>sorry, sorry, really truly sorry</em> song and dance act, the
        <em>weren’t we awful</em> performance, the Kumbaya Pavilion, the
        Environmental Hypersensitivity Pavilion, the Victimological Grievance
        Pavilion, the Beyond Growth Pavilion, the There Must Be A Gentler Way
        Pavilion, any national or corporate pavilion without exhibition objects
        (roughly half), almost everything bearing the imprint of tourist boards,
        media studies graduates, or diplomatic services, and every usage of
        solar panels that isn’t strictly tailored to commercial exploitation on
        a massive scale. In addition, any national pavilion based entirely on
        ethnic kitsch gets grouped together with others of its kind in an exotic
        tourism area, because it’s admitting to a complete absence of creative
        capability and needs to be mocked. <em>No robots, no platform</em>:
        that’s the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asia Unleashed also needs a lot of things brought in, most of all
        machines. Expo is all about machines, even though every Expo over the
        last half-century has been pitifully deficient in this regard. It
        scarcely needs mentioning that the entire Expo site should be pulsing,
        crawling, and twitching with robots of every type and scale, from
        industrial goliaths, automated submarines and space vehicles, through
        charismatic androids, to intelligent household appliances, Go players,
        robopets, and insectiform mechanisms. To push the process along, those
        countries and corporations with the laziest robot exhibits can be
        publicly ridiculed over the PA system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expo is an exhibition, and its historical sickness is perfectly tracked
        by the degeneration of this elementary conception into PR. Organizers at
        all levels, from the pinnacle of the international Expo bureaucracy
        (BIE) downwards, clearly need to be forcefully reminded of the
        difference. For instance, video technology is an entirely suitable
        object for Expo display, and videos themselves can quite appropriately
        play a supportive, informative role. To center an ‘exhibition’ upon
        videos, however, especially when they have been put together, using
        state-of-the-art advertising techniques, with the entire purpose of
        selling a national or corporate brand through image associations and
        spin, is a complete abnegation of responsibility and should
        straightforwardly be banned, or at least boycotted, derided, and
        rendered ineffective through inundating contempt. The only acceptable
        center of an Expo display is an object, preferably astonishing, fetched
        from the outer edge of industrial capability in order to concretely
        represent the trajectory of material progress. Displaying such objects –
        and thereby respecting audiences sufficiently to evaluate them for
        themselves – is the non-negotiable, basic function of Expo as an
        institution. If it can no longer accept this task, it should be
        terminated (by a giant robot, if possible).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Asia Unleashed</em> is dedicated to the latest and impending phases
        of global industrial civilization, which should be more-or-less implicit
        in the fact that it is a World Expo, although sadly, it isn’t. There’s
        plenty of room for artworks and other singular cultural creations, but
        the emphasis is edgily modernistic. Green technology gets in because
        it’s technology, and the tourism industry gets in because it’s an
        industry, but in both cases the spin-meisters have been reined back
        hard, and the preliminary question insistently raised: “What, really,
        are you exhibiting here?” The only organizers who get to avoid such
        suspicious interrogations are the ones overseeing the erection of some
        fabulous structure that looks as if it comes from the set of a science
        fiction movie, or unloading partially-animated assemblages of glistening
        metal from mountainous stacks of shipping containers, because – clearly
        – they understand what an Expo is all about. The cyclopean space
        elevator anchor station, taking shape in the Extraterrestrial Resources
        Exploitation Zone, serves as a model for the guiding spirit of the
        festival. The machinery in the 3D printing pavilion printed the
        pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mining industry employs monster trucks weighing 203 tonnes, with a
        capacity to carry 360 tonnes, they cost US$3 million each, their tires
        are four-meters in diameter, and driving one is like “driving a house” –
        why on earth didn’t Expo 2010 have one? <em>Asia Unleashed</em> most
        certainly would. For developed countries with the resources to put on an
        impressive show at Expo there needs to be something like a price for
        admission, and an awe-inspiring piece of industrial machinery fits the
        bill exactly. The Canadian tar sands are being criss-crossed by these
        monster trucks, and the Canada national pavilion should have been
        strongly <em>advised</em> to bring one over. Instead they brought …
        (hands up if anyone remembers).
      </p>
      <p>
        All the imagination that has been squandered over decades in utopian
        speculations of the “another world is possible” type has been far more
        productively employed at <em>Asia Unleashed</em>, counter-balancing the
        tendency of advanced industrial capabilities to flee from the arena of
        spectacle. The monumental achievements and consequences of intensely
        miniaturized and softened technologies demand exhibition, from silicon
        chip fabrication, gene sequencing, and rudimentary nanotechnology, to
        cryptosystems, social networks, digital microfinance, and virtual
        architecture, even as they slip through their inner inexorable logic
        into invisibility. To present these frontiers of industrial capability
        rapidly, dramatically, and memorably to a highly-diverse, transient Expo
        audience requires the application of creative intelligence on a massive
        scale. The growing challenges of this task are worthy of the rising
        computer-augmented talents brought to bear upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Asia Unleashed</em> never happened, of course, partly because the
        international Expo institutional apparatus is locked into the Occidental
        death-slide, but mostly because it would have been impolite. Ultimately,
        postmodernist multicultural political correctness – today’s hegemonic
        globalist ideology — is an elaborate etiquette, designed to prevent the
        ‘insensitive’ identification and diagnosis of failure, and to elude,
        indefinitely, the blunt statement: “What you’re doing doesn’t work.” No
        Expo that remained true to its deep institutional traditions could avoid
        such a statement arising, implicitly, through contrast. Hence, Expo has
        been condemned to die, by inertial forces too profound for Expo 2010 to
        fully arrest, let alone reverse: <em>Better decayed than rude</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the wreckage of the Expo institution, however, Expo 2010 was able
        to extract, polish, and resuscitate a crucial modernist topic: the city
        as engine of progress. More on that in Part 3.

      <h5><em>What makes a great city?</em></h5>
      <p>
        By far the most interesting element of
        <em>World Expo 2010: Shanghai</em>, was Shanghai. Whilst deeply-rooted
        regional traditions of courtesy sustained the fiction that this World
        Fair was about the world, it really wasn’t. Whatever the diplomatic
        benefits of the almost universally convenient internationalist pretense,
        to China and Expo’s foreign participants alike, Expo 2010 was about
        Shanghai, and for Shanghai. The Expo was global because Shanghai is, it
        was about China because Shanghai is China’s gateway to the world, it was
        about cities in order to be even more about Shanghai, nobody
        uninterested in Shanghai paid it the slightest attention, and Shanghai
        used it to restructure, intensify, and promote itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expo as an institution was in decline before 2010, and continues to
        decline. Shanghai was rising before 2010, and continues to rise, but now
        infrastructurally upgraded, thoroughly renovated, and decorated with the
        historical merit-badge of Expo hospitality.
        <em>Better City, Better Life</em>, a typically airy and aspirational
        Expo theme, is a cold-sober description of the Expo-effect in Shanghai.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cities are, in certain important respects, generic. There is such a
        thing as ‘the city in general’ as the work of Geoffrey West, in
        particular, has demonstrated. We know, thanks to West, that cities are
        negative organisms, with consistent scaling characteristics that
        structurally differentiate them from animals and corporations. As they
        grow they accelerate and intensify at a quantifiable and predictable
        rate, exhibiting increasing returns to scale (in sharp contrast to
        animals and businesses, which slow down in proportion to their size).
        Organisms and firms die normally and by necessity, cities only rarely
        and by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cities belong to a real genre, but they are also singularities,
        undergoing spontaneous individuation. In fact, they are generically
        singular – singular without exception – like black holes. It is not only
        that no city is like another, no city <em>can</em> be like another, and
        this is a feature that all cities share, arguably more than any other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond such generic singularity, there is an additional level of
        enhanced differentiation that emerges from the position cities occupy
        within larger systems. These systems are not only internally
        specialized, but also hierarchical, dividing core from periphery, and
        distributing influence unevenly between them. Ultimately, within the
        fully global incarnation of the ‘world system’, cities acquire secondary
        metropolitan characteristics, to very different degrees, in accordance
        with their geographical and functional proximity to the center of the
        world. They transcend their local histories, to become hubs or nodes in
        a global network that re-characterizes them as parts of a whole rather
        than wholes made of parts, as metropolis-versus-periphery rather than
        (or on top of) metropolis-versus-town.
      </p>
      <p>
        The geographical structure and historical instability of modernity’s
        core-periphery architecture has been the focus of the ‘world system
        theory’ developed from the Annales School of Fernand Braudel (1902-85)
        by Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-) and – most impressively — Giovanni
        Arrighi (1937-2009). According to the world system theorists, the
        revolutions that matter most are not national regime changes, such as
        those in France (1789) and Russia (1917), but rather global
        re-organizations that mark out the basic phases of modern history,
        jolting the world into new core-periphery structures. Modernity has
        undergone four of these shifts up to the present, with each phase
        lasting for a ‘long century’, introducing a new core state, or hegemon,
        with enhanced capabilities, and a new urban center – successively,
        Venice, Amsterdam, London, and New York – that operate as an effective
        capital of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the example of New York attests, this status is not primarily
        political. Nor does prominence in manufacturing seem to be a relevant
        factor (the ‘world capital’ has never been the dominant industrial
        center of its respective region or state). Over the course of modern
        history to date, the crucial features of the world capital seem to be
        that it is the largest urban agglomeration in the leading (‘hegemonic’)
        region or state; that it is an established financial center that quite
        rapidly attains a position of global pre-eminence in this respect; that
        it is an open port city with clear maritime orientation; and that it has
        an exceptionally internationalized demographic profile, with a large
        segment of internationally-mobile, opportunistic residents. A
        significant period of leadership in the creative arts might plausibly be
        added to this list. Functionally, the world capital serves as the
        supreme nerve-center of the global economy, specialized nationally, and
        then super-specialized internationally, as the financial, logistics, and
        business services hub of a system whose global integrity is reflected in
        the city’s privileged singularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exceptional drama of our age lies in its nature as a time of
        transition between phases of modernity, somewhere in the winter of a
        long century, when an epoch of hegemony is exhausted. More specifically,
        the walls are closing in on the American Age, as commentators of almost
        every intellectual and ideological stripe are increasingly aware.
        Overstretched, essentially bankrupted, politically paralyzed and
        disillusioned, America sinks into self-conscious crisis, its mood dark
        and clouded. It would be a mistake to limit attention to America,
        however, because the crisis is world-systemic, heralding the end of an
        international order that arose among the chaos of the world wars and
        achieved definition in the post-WWII United Nations and Bretton Woods
        institutions (IMF, World Bank, and the descendent of GATT, now the WTO).
        It affects not only the role of the US dollar as international reserve
        currency, an Atlantic-centered NATO and an Occidentally-skewed UN
        apparatus, but also the European Union, the post-colonial Middle Eastern
        state-system and (very) much else besides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next two decades, under the impact of economic forces of
        extreme profundity (far exceeding the responsive capacity of existing
        institutions), a revolutionary re-ordering of the world can be expected
        to unfold. If America succeeds in maintaining its position of leadership
        within the global system for a period that significantly exceeds the
        long 20th century (which began no earlier than 1914, and thus might be
        expected to persist for some additional years), it will have broken a
        pattern that has remained consistent throughout a half-millennium of
        history. Whilst not strictly impossible, perpetuation of the present
        hegemonic order would be, quite literally, a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another vision of a break from historical precedent, this time
        transparently utopian, envisages – rather than the continuation of US
        pre-eminence — the obsolescence of the core-periphery global structure
        in its entirety, ending hierarchical geography and hegemony in general.
        Even If such a vision truly rises to the level of a definite expectation
        (rather than a nebulous exercise in wishful thinking), it remains
        ungrounded in reliable historical and theoretical foundations.
        Altruistic political intentions – were such ever credible – would still
        be quite insufficient to overcome the spontaneous, dynamic trend to
        approximate world systemic equilibrium, in which a core zone, and its
        metropolitan capital, are automatically nominated, by diffuse economic
        currents searching for a central clearing house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst no doubt deeply disappointing to utopian eschatology, and to all
        dreams of historical conclusion (or passage to the promised land),
        phase-shifts in the world-system are less ominous than they are often
        depicted as being. Among Arrighi’s most important insights is the
        reminder that whenever an attempted reconstruction of the world order
        has been based upon a frontal military and geo-strategic challenge to
        the hegemon, it has failed. This is exemplified, above all, by the
        German and Russian histories of the 19th and 20th centuries, in which
        repeated direct confrontations with the established Anglophone-dominated
        international system led only to frustration, regime collapse, and
        subaltern re-integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps ironically, a marked subjective aversion to hard power assertion
        and the assumption of hegemony can be quite reliably taken as a positive
        indicator for the objective emergence of hegemonic status. Holland,
        Great Britain, and the United States of America were all, in certain
        crucial respects, accidental imperialists, whose successive ascents to
        world dominance shared a prioritization of commercial motives, retarded
        state involvement, strong ‘isolationist’ and ‘anti-imperialist’ cultural
        currents, and a determined avoidance of ‘Clauswitzean’ decisive
        collision (especially with the prior hegemon). The British and American
        ways of war, in particular, are notable for their common emphasis upon
        hedging and triangulation, such as the exploitation of offshore position
        and maritime supremacy to avoid premature entanglement in high intensity
        ‘continental’ conflicts, the usage of financial and logistic capability
        to manipulate conflicts at a distance, and the diplomatic inclusion of
        defeated adversaries in reconstructed, poly-centric, ‘balanced’ systems
        of power. Hegemony was, in each case, peacefully inherited, even when it
        was cemented by war (in <em>partnership</em> with the previous hegemon)
        and later gave rise to opportunities for increasingly aggressive
        imperialistic adventurism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given this broadly uncontroversial historical pattern, it is all the
        more surprising that the German example is so widely invoked in
        discussions of China’s ‘peaceful rise’. In fact, China’s ascent has
        stuck far closer to the model of hegemonic hand-overs than to that of
        confrontational challenges, as indicated by the prioritization of
        commercial development, the highly cooperative (even synergistic or
        ‘Chimerican’) relationship with the prevailing hegemon, the gradual
        accumulation of financial power by way of spontaneous, systemic
        re-distribution, and the equally gradual consolidation of maritime
        interests, emerging out of the global trading system, which draw the
        focus of government strategic policy – perhaps reluctantly – from
        domestic concerns out into the high-seas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, China has been far more a continental than a maritime
        power, and this fact provides the single most persuasive objection to
        the assumption of an impending Chinese (Long) Century. The emergence of
        a continental world system core would be as decisive a departure from
        precedent as any yet discussed, and if such a possibility is
        entertained, disciplined prediction falters. If inverted, however, this
        problem becomes a forecast in itself: the trajectory of China’s rise
        necessarily implies its transformation into a maritime power (an insight
        already tacit in the controversial 1988 Chinese TV series
        <em>River Elegy</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A vague intuition, partially but elusively crystallized by Expo 2010, is
        now precipitated by sheer historical pattern-recognition into the form
        of an explicit question:

      <h5><em>What does the world make of Shanghai?</em></h5>
      <p>
        If the deepest traditions of the World Expo are those cemented into its
        origin, it would be incautious to over-hastily dismiss one prominent
        feature of its inaugural instance. The Great Exhibition of the Works of
        Industry of all Nations, held in London, in 1851, was staged in the
        effective capital of the world. In this case, at least, the defining
        internationalism of the Expo is difficult to disentangle from the
        indisputable historical fact that the entire world was rapidly becoming
        London’s business. In a gesture of reciprocity so perfect that it
        approached simple identity, London invited the world to itself exactly
        as – and because – it was inviting itself to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Exhibition made irresistible sense because it put the future
        of the world on display in the only place that could. To see the
        concentrated, realistically sifted, programmatically arranged destiny of
        the earth, it was necessary to visit London, since it was in London that
        everything came together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over its first two decades (and four episodes), World Expo alternated
        between London (1851, 1862) and Paris (1855, 1867), as if oscillating
        between the relative historical potencies of maritime and continental
        power. Yet this apparent hesitation actually compresses and conceals two
        distinct, complementary, and unambiguous trends. Britain was ascending
        inexorably to global hegemony, whilst disengaging from World Expo,
        whilst France was managing equally inexorable comparative decline, as it
        made World Expo – to a remarkable extent – its special preserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is tempting to propose a theory of institutional consolation to
        account for this pattern. Long after Britain had abandoned all claim to
        Expo leadership, France continued to invest heavily in the event,
        chalking-up a record of Expo hospitality unmatched by any other country
        and setting the course to Expo institutionalization through the Bureau
        of International Exhibitions (BIE). The BIE, established in 1928, has
        always been based in Paris, and remains a bastion of Anglo-French
        bilingualism.
      </p>
      <p>
        French Expo-enthusiasm expresses a more general relationship to the
        world system of great importance. Having relinquished its (Napoleonic)
        role as a challenger to the world order in the early 19th century,
        France has maneuvered, with unique capability and determination, to
        remain an indispensable secondary power, or – more precisely – a
        balancer. Its relationship to the successive phases of Anglophone global
        hegemony has been guided by an extremely consistent deep policy of
        accommodation without acquiescence, characterized by imaginative and
        unrelenting, yet restrained rivalry. Close to the core, yet never quite
        part of it, France has been able to draw sustenance from the world order
        whilst contesting its cultural meaning (as English-speaking, protestant,
        and <em>laissez-faire</em> individualist).
      </p>
      <p>
        World system challengers, it should be clearly noted, never host World
        Expos. The Expos held in Japan (Osaka 1970, Tsukuba 1985, Aichi 2005)
        and Germany (Hanover 2000) took place long after their armed resistance
        to the Anglo-American world order had been broken and both countries had
        been beaten into docility. Russia has never hosted one. Moscow of the
        USSR was offered the 1967 World Expo, but declined it (presumably
        judging it dangerously destabilizing to a closed society).
      </p>
      <p>
        World Expo has thus acquired a secondary tradition, as a deliberately
        eccentric platform from which to contest the <em>core future</em> of the
        world system, and to propose a pluralized (or embryonically
        multicultural) alternative. Already in 1855 and 1867, and then in 1878,
        1889, 1900, and 1937, World Expo staged <em>the view from Paris</em>,
        one that accepted the global reality of consolidated, revolutionary
        modernization, whilst systematically de-emphasizing its
        techno-commercial determinism and its convergence upon Anglophone
        cultural traits. Industrial globalization was reconfigured as a
        condition to be critically interrogated, rather than an opportunity to
        be vigorously promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the primary and secondary impulses of the Expo, collision was
        inevitable. Predictably enough, the occasion was provided by the
        reconnection of Expo to the global core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even given this truncated and radically simplified schema of Expo
        history, which had been largely settled in its essentials by 1870, the
        significance of the two New York World Expos, staged in 1939-40 and
        1964-5, comes clearly into focus. Mid-20th century New York, like every
        world systemic capital, represented the leading edge of modernization as
        a revolutionary global process — emergence and consolidation of a new
        world order and new age (<em>novus ordo seclorum</em>) – compared to
        which the authority of established international institutions counted
        for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both New York Expos flagrantly violated BIE regulations in numerous
        respects, but even after the withdrawal of official sanction, they ahead
        anyway. These were, non-coincidentally, the first rogue Expos. They were
        also among the most memorable and influential in World Expo history.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time since the mid-19th century, Expo had found its way
        back to the capital of the world, in order to provide an uncompromised
        and unambiguous foretaste of the
        <em><a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7E1930s/display/39wf/frame.htm" target="_blank">World of
            Tomorrow</a></em>
        in the place that was orchestrating it. BIE opinion mattered little,
        because Expo was not being hosted in New York so much as re-invented,
        echoing the originality of 1851. This was where the future would come
        from, and everyone knew it. All that was necessary was to tease the city
        into anticipating itself, and what resulted was a
        <em><a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/15-12/ff_futurama_original"
            target="_blank">Futurama</a></em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an additional message, easily overlooked due to the scarcity
        of data-points: hosting World Expo is one of the things the world
        capital has to do — as a kind of ritual responsibility, or a coming-out
        party. Shanghai has done that now. Precedent suggests that one
        additional Expo would be appropriate (perhaps in 2025, or 2030),
        although it might have to be unsanctioned next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Shanghai is not yet the capital of the world, but it is
        <a href="http://www.newgeography.com/content/002397-inside-the-sinosphere" target="_blank">heading there</a>.
        From
        the late-1970s, after centuries of exile and denigration, the
        offshore, diasporic-maritime, capitalistic China of the
        <em>tianchao qimin</em> — those ‘abandoned by the Celestial Empire’ –
        has been steadily, and rapidly, re-integrated with the continental
        mainland and its ‘market socialist’ structures. Floodgates of talent and
        investment have been opened, and as this scattered, sea-salt scented
        population has reconnected with the motherland, the ‘Chinese miracle’ of
        recent decades has taken place. Shanghai is the main-circuit socket that
        links this other China — oriented to oceanic trade, entrepreneurial
        opportunity, capital accumulation, international mobility, and a society
        of flexible networks — to the vast potentialities of the country (and
        flexible Sino-Marxist state) lying up the Yangzi, and beyond. If the
        process of reconnection is not interrupted, the next phase of modernity
        will be centered in this city, where China meets the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite its self-identification as the ‘central country’ (or ‘middle
        kingdom’ – <em>Zhongguo</em>), China has not been at the core of the
        world process for centuries. Instead it has been a complacently
        declining legacy power and a badly-treated outsider, then successively a
        second-tier affiliate, a truculent challenger, and a cautious balancer,
        until its prospective status as core inheritor (or virtual hegemon)
        began to percolate into global popular awareness over the final decades
        of the 20th century. Very little of this is a matter of motivation, or
        strategic assertion. Quasi-Marxist assumptions of economic inevitability
        and directional base-superstructure causation come into their own in
        this respect. Global leadership is nominated by industrial reality, not
        political will, and hegemony can neither be perpetuated beyond the
        endurance of its economic foundations, nor long disdained once such
        foundations have been laid. Eventually a reality check becomes
        unavoidable, and policy is hammered into compliance with the demands of
        world system equilibrium. Core-periphery relations are decided by trade
        and capital flows, not by political declarations. Since comparative
        success and failure show no sign at all of disappearing, it can
        confidently be expected that hierarchical geography – however
        re-arranged – will not be withering away any time soon. Realists will
        follow the money.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be a new world capital (you can count on it), but will it be
        Shanghai? It would be reckless to presume so. The world system
        tradition, in its eagerness to anoint Tokyo as the successor to New York
        (during the 1980s), provides a cautionary lesson. There was no Tokyo
        World Expo, and it turns out that there was not an urgent or essential
        need for one.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, <em>is Shanghai next?</em> That should have been the animating
        question of Expo 2010, and perhaps it will have been in the future. The
        whole world has a stake in it, because it tells us what is coming, and
        that is what World Expo was designed to do. For an emerging world
        capital to mask itself as a generic city passes beyond modesty into a
        species of accidental deception, but tact can easily be confused with
        pretence – especially by those on unfamiliar cultural terrain. It might
        be that Shanghai said everything that was necessary in 2010, and that
        what it said will eventually be heard, and understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expo begins again in each new world capital, in 1851, in 1939, and – far
        more problematically – in 2010 (?). In Shanghai’s case, we are still too
        close to the event, and too entangled in the current revolution of
        modernity, to know for sure. What Expo 2010 will have been depends upon
        what the world becomes, how its center of economic gravity shifts, how
        its new center condenses, and what it makes of Shanghai.

      <h5><em>The Call of Haibao</em></h5>
      <p>
        Dispatched from the British Consulate, Doctor Helen Goodwhite arrives at
        the Jiangnan Special Hospital for Inexplicable Foreign Devilry to
        interview a problematic inmate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: How are you feeling today Mister Vaughn?
        They tell me you’re quite a bit calmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: OK, I guess. A little disoriented. How long …?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Do you remember why you’re here?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Those scars on your arms, any ideas?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: [Hesitating] Some kind of accident …?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: I’ve got some witness reports here, all
        very consistent, maybe they’ll jog something. It seems that you were
        walking down Nanjing East Road when you suddenly started shrieking
        “a-ya, a-ya, a-ya” with a highly unconvincing Chinese accent before
        switching to English and shouting “Get out. Get out. We have to get out
        of the city.” After that, when nobody took any notice, you continued to
        ‘yell aggressively’ …Umm, let’s see [riffling through her notes], ah
        yes, “Haibao spawn, you’re all effing Haibao spawn, effing plague-blood
        zombie Haibao spawn,” and so on, considerable obscenity it appears, and
        then … ah, here we are “filthy future-toxed effing robot Haibao spawn,
        die, die, we’re all going to die” et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Then
        you rushed across the street and smashed the plate-glass window of an
        Expo gift shop with your bare hands. [Looking up] Do you remember any of
        that, mister Vaughn?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Some of it, yes. Now you mention it. It’s
        coming back. But it wasn’t really like that.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: It wasn’t?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Not really, no. At least, those things
        happened, yes …
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: They did?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Yes, but it’s just, what they meant …
        [hesitating]
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Go on.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Well, they didn’t mean anything of course, what
        I meant to say was, well, it was sort of a mistake.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: A ‘mistake’?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Yes, or, I guess, more of a misunderstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: I’m afraid you’re going to have to be a
        great deal more specific if we’re going to make any progress.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: It’s rather complicated.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Please. Just start at the beginning.</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: I suppose it began at the pavilion.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: The UK Expo pavilion?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: I was working there you know.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: It’s in the file.</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: So you know what it looked like?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: The tendrils, the shimmering, the name like a
        taunt from … them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: It was called the ‘Seed Cathedral’,
        according to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Seed Cathedral, Sea Cthudral, whatever, it had
        been sent back, sent up, to show us their true ‘face’. … At least,
        that’s what I thought at the time, but that’s just ridiculous, isn’t it?
        I realize that now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: But at ‘the time’ you thought ‘they’ had
        ‘sent it back’?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: I’d been working too hard. It was quite
        stressful, you know. I wasn’t sleeping well, worrying, and that’s when
        they began chatting.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Who were ‘they’ Mister Vaughn?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: The Haibao, of course.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Ah yes, the Expo mascot …</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: Mask, not mascot.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Did you know that the Shanghai Corporate
        Pavilion was defaced with luminous blue paint, on the night of September
        the ninth? [She passes a photograph.]
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: [Shudders silently]</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: The message is rather cryptic, but your
        words reminded me of it, for some reason. It’s a bit difficult to read
        from the photo, but I’ve got a transcript. “We are many and yet
        singular. Our name equals 90, the seething void, enfolding artificial
        intelligence and the terminal alpha-omega. We come from the depths, from
        the blue screen at the end of the world. Cthublue.”
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: I don’t know anything about that.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Really?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: It’s Haibao cultist, hardcore. I’d never touch
        that stuff – not ever.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Yet you seem to recognize it.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: From dreams — bad, really bad, dreams. I told
        you, I wasn’t sleeping well. They wouldn’t stop talking, telling me
        things I didn’t want to hear, I couldn’t stop them. I tried, but they
        kept calling me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Calling you to <em>bow </em>before the
        most <em>high</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: [Outraged] I never said that. I’d never say
        that. It’s absurd, obscene. It’s not even code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: [Checking her notes] So, you understand
        now that ‘hairy crab’ isn’t a secret anagram for ‘Haibao’?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: Yes, I can see that, of course.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: It isn’t even close, really — too many
        letters, for one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Well, six and nine are rotational twins, and
        ‘o’ is a ‘cry’. [Sobs slightly] … It’s all nonsense. I see that now. I
        was confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: The trouble, Mister Vaughn, is that this
        subject still seems to excite you rather disproportionately. I think we
        need to conduct a little test. Let’s see what happens when we compare
        this [she reaches into her bag and lifts out the statuette of a
        tentacle-faced abomination, sculpted long ago by some Pacific island
        tribe, presumed extinct] with this [a soft, cartoonish, vaguely
        anthropomorphic blue doll, suggestive of a toothpaste advert for
        children]. The similarity isn’t especially striking, is it?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: No, no, no, no, NOOOOOOOOOO.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: I’m sorry, what?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: [In an almost indiscernible whisper] Deep ones.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: I didn’t catch that.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: From the depths, the ocean – deep ones. They’re
        from the sea – ‘treasure from the sea’ [laughs morbidly]. Even you have
        to understand that, doctor. Globalization, technocapitalism, Shanghai,
        alien invasion, the Thing — it could hardly be clearer. It’s escaped
        from the abyss, and now it’s exposed. The time has come. Sea Change,
        Modernity, call it whatever you want, it doesn’t matter. The Haibao will
        tell us how to think soon enough, and we’ll comply, because they’re
        behind us, beneath us, and we’ll peel away from what they always were
        like dead skin from a snake. They’ve shown us the ultimate city god
        already, so it won’t be long. Their words are arriving, whispers,
        mutterings …
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: [Disquieted]
        <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/mv/ircbot/PARALINGUA2.php?VOLUME=45&amp;amp;ARTICLE=230&amp;amp;PAGE=67&amp;amp;REF=Ise"
          target="_blank">Oabiah nasce zhee ute ewoit</a>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: That means nothing to you?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: Nothing.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Strange, then, that it’s tattooed on your
        arm.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vaughn</strong>: I’ve no idea how it got there.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Alright, let’s move on, shall we?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: Move where doctor? We’re already here, in the
        city at the end of the world, the thing that came out of the sea. We
        aren’t going anywhere. It’s coming for us, right now, and it can’t be
        stopped. What did you expect? A New Jerusalem? [laughing unpleasantly]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: Alright Mister Vaughn, I think we’re done
        here. We need to get you some proper, professional attention. Then,
        after some rest, back to your family …
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: [Prolonged laughter, even more ghastly] Too
        late, doctor! Way too late. The Haibao have already taken them. It came
        for the children first, don’t you realize that? Do you know how many
        Haibao dolls my sweet little kiddies have accumulated? [Voice cracking]
        Seventeen! They might as well have tentacles growing out of their
        eye-sockets — it would all amount to the same thing. Haibao melted their
        souls into the blue screen months ago. That generation’s gone. Long
        gone. It was over even before the Haibao clones slithered out of the
        television set.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: [Backing away nervously] This has been a
        very interesting chat, but I’ve really got to be going now. I’ll tell
        the consulate that … that …
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaughn</strong>: [Zoned-out into the blue] They want to
        transmute us — replace us – with something unspeakable, with a bionic
        monstrosity from beyond the blue screen. Our metropolises are turning
        into, into … Actually they were never ours. The deep ones, the Haibao,
        were always using them to modify us, using us to make them – that’s the
        circuit: alien animation. It was a cosmic gamble, a bet, and now they’re
        raking it in …
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Goodwhite</strong>: [Turns pale, a hideous comprehension
        dawning] Better city, better life …

        There’s always something huge happening in Shanghai — and usually
        several things. Out at the leading edge over the last two years has been
        the tsunami of urban development along the Huangpu waterfront to the
        south of the Puxi metropolitan core, in an area that has been named
        ‘Xuhui Riverside’ or ‘West Bund’. The scale of what is underway there is
        (of course) utterly stunning.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mixture of new residential complexes and prestige towers is under
        construction, and the immediate waterfront has already been redeveloped
        into a strip of interconnected parks and boardwalks (constituting the
        8.4km ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Corniche">Shanghai Corniche</a>‘). Along the river, a
        neo-modern aesthetic prevails, characterized by
        elegantly re-purposed heavy industrial structures: slabs of concrete,
        disused rail tracks, and massive cargo cranes. As elsewhere in the city,
        the heavy-duty Shanghai 1.0 has been playfully folded over itself, in a
        stylish celebration of modernist heritage. The future is presented as a
        re-launch of the past. For anybody mesmerized by time-spirals, it’s
        irresistible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-191"></span>The role allotted to the arts in this process
        of urban re-animation is especially notable. Even in a city blitzed into
        delirium by an explosive growth of arts space, the proliferation of
        galleries, theaters, museums, and other cultural centers in the West
        Bund comes as a scarcely-comprehensible shock. The subsonic sucking roar
        of this new cultural capacity, emitted in overlapping ripples as it
        extends its devouring appetite throughout the city and far beyond,
        reaches a magnitude that seems to bend space and time. There are entire
        national cultures in the world that would be hard-pressed to fill it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coming out party for this arts infrastructure was held on a suitably
        stupendous scale.
        <em>Westbund 2013: A Biennial of Architecture and Contemporary Art</em>
        <a href="http://www.westbundbiennial.com/enindex.html">included</a> an
        interlocking set of exhibitions, each of which would have been
        dazzlingly impressive on its own. <em>Sound Art China</em> introduced
        the country’s sonic bleeding edge in its
        <em>Revolutions Per Minute</em> event, set up within four renovated oil
        storage tanks. The adjacent West Bund Exhibition Center — a redeveloped
        industrial structure of truly cyclopean proportions — hosted a
        multi-threaded sound / video / architecture / cinematic history show in
        and around a central ‘Inter-Media Megastructure’ that fully lived up to
        its grandiose name. A more modest urban development exhibition in a
        nearby warehouse space did its best to explain the epic convulsions that
        the area was undergoing. (I think the appropriate word is ‘awesome’,
        cubed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s only one reasonable conclusion: Shanghai is sheer cosmic
        splendor compacted for terrestrial application, and expressed through
        aesthetic overload. Cynicism can wait for another occasion.

        <b>Whatever else is to be learned from ‘A Dream I Dreamed’ — the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama">Kusama</a>
          Yayoi</b>
        exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Shanghai (Dec 15 to March
        30, 2014) — the most superficially striking lesson is sociological.
        Shanghainese — and especially young Shanghainese — can’t get enough of
        this stuff. After almost two months, queues no longer regularly stretch
        all the way through People’s Park and out onto Nanjing Xi Lu, but they
        still over-spill the gallery. Both thematically and socially, this is a
        show about multitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.yayoi-kusama.jp/e/information/index.html">Kusama</a>, born in 1929, has an artistic career
        stretching back to the 1950s.
        Throughout seven decades, as her celebrity has waxed and waned in waves,
        her artistic focus — or, more exactly, her strategic ‘obliteration’ of
        focus — has remained remarkably constant. Sensuous disintegration of
        self and world into dot pattern has been a continuous preoccupation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-223"></span>The MoCA show concentrates upon Kusama’s very
        recent work, mostly from the last two years. To a general audience, the
        best known pieces are probably her large, brightly bi-colored, speckled
        pumpkins, enjoyed for their pop-art accessibility and unpretentious
        aestheticism. When encountered within the context of the show, however,
        the disciplined dot shading on these works takes on an unsuspected
        seriousness, as it is sucked into swirls, drifts, and flurries of dots
        in different colors, across picture planes and sculptured surfaces, and
        even into illusory volumes. Through a power of pure multiplicity,
        Kusama’s vivid, relentlessly cheerful pop-art chromatics become the
        tails of neonized guiding streaks, hurtling into cosmic vistas and
        shattered states of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dotted tulips, dotted dogs, huge mushroom-styled dotted spheres,
        ‘Infinity Dots’ (2012), ‘Infinity Double Dots’ (2013), and the ‘Infinity
        Nets’ (numerous, 2013) created by the diffuse dot-puncturing of space …
        it becomes all-too easy to understand why Kusama chooses to live in a
        Japanese mental hospital as an OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)
        patient, and why her own accounts of her work wander so uninterruptedly
        between aesthetics and psychopathology. Her installation ‘I’m Here, but
        Nothing’ (2013), consisting of a living room  suffused with violet light
        and blitzed with countless hallucinatory dots, provides something close
        to an insanity portal. Visitors entering the ‘Obliteration Room’ are
        handed a sheet of colorful dot stickers and invited to go crazy. It’s at
        once humorously and seriously dotty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The works are typically without center, diffusing perception smoothly
        across sheer distribution, sometimes through spaces expanded to infinity
        through installed mirrors. The sense of religious suggestion is
        occasionally made explicit, as in ‘Transmigration’ (2011) — an
        ‘infinity-net’ style acrylic painting whose numinous title is only
        reinforced by its thematic continuity with the rest of the show. In 
        ‘Narcissus Garden’ (2013), a packed array of stainless steel spheres,
        mirroring and the assembly of featureless particles are finally fused
        (although this work is more notable for its neat infolding of Kusama’s
        artistic vocabulary than for its aesthetic power). To immerse ‘oneself’
        in this exhibition is to be strewn across the void, lost in clouds, and
        in crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kusama’s appeal manifests an East Asian  ‘pop’ sensibility that clearly
        works in Shanghai, attesting once again to the influence of contemporary
        Japanese culture throughout the region, and to the continued relevance
        of common religious traditions. Beyond — or simply through — the
        deliberate frivolity of this work, something profound, and shattering,
        is being shared. It’s well worth adding yourself to the crowds.

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Might urbanization be the leading theme of China’s 5<sup>th</sup>
        generation CCP administration? The background to this question is the
        process of Chinese urbanization itself. Over the three decades of Reform
        and Opening, China’s urban population rose from 20% to 53% of the
        (rising) total, resulting in over half a billion new urbanites. The
        economic and geostrategic consequences of this transformation have
        profoundly re-structured the world. (It is the central fact of the
        Pacific-centered Modernity 2.0.)

        the basics:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In China, economic growth and urbanization have gone hand in hand.
          When Deng Xiaoping initiated Reform and Opening in 1978, the vast
          majority of the population lived and worked in the countryside — just
          as Chinese people had for centuries. But over the past three and a
          half decades, as special economic zones churned out exports and China
          modernized its cities, hundreds of millions of people migrated to
          urban areas seeking work in the manufacturing and service sectors.
          This … has made China — and the Chinese — much wealthier.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-20"></span>The guideline themes of China’s 4<sup>th</sup>
        generation CCP leadership – ‘harmonious society’ and ‘scientific
        development’ – were no doubt sculpted by the stresses and policy
        challenges of massive urbanization, but they addressed the phenomenon
        indirectly. There are numerous indications that a more
        specifically-focused emphasis upon urbanization is now emerging. In
        particular, China’s new Premier Li Keqiang envisages the topic as a
        nexus, where many of the country’s development and governance issues
        meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chinese journal <em>Qiushi</em> published an article on urbanization
        by Li Keqiang in its Winter 2012 issue (translated into English by He
        Shan and Chen Xia
        <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-05/26/content_28934485.htm">here</a>). Framed by the expectation
        (attributed to “Foreign economists”) “that
        China’s urbanization and U.S. high technology would emerge as twin
        engines of the global economy in the 21st century,” it rewards close
        scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis of <a href="http://www.mpettis.com/">Michael Pettis</a>,
        who identifies insufficient domestic consumption (by households) as
        China’s pre-eminent economic obstacle, is a valuable preparation for
        this discussion, which begins: “Urbanization has the greatest potential
        for boosting domestic demand.” Li argues that China remains relatively
        under-urbanized, so the propulsion to “exponential urban growth”
        continues, with at least partially predictable implications. Since
        “urban residents spent 3.6 times more than rural dwellers in 2010” it
        can be confidently anticipated that consumer spending will rise as a
        function of urbanization, contributing automatically to economic
        re-balancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… it is estimated that every rural resident who becomes an urban
          dweller will increase consumption by more than 10,000 yuan (US$1,587).
          And each one percent increase in the urbanization rate in only one
          year will see more than 10 million rural residents absorbed into the
          cities. This will, in turn, translate into consumption totaling more
          than 100 billion yuan (US$15.9 billion) and correspondingly create
          more investment opportunities.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Full realization of these opportunities, Li argues, will require reform
        or abolition of the country’s <em>hukou</em> system of residence
        registry, with its “urban-rural dual structure.” In other respects, too,
        vigorous government action is recommended, as long as it achieves
        “conformity with the objective law of urban development.” (Investigating
        “the objective law of urban development” is the primary mission of this
        blog, so it is a concept we shall obsessively return to.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Core government responsibilities are taken to include the mitigation of
        social conflicts and problems, infrastructure investment, and
        administrative intervention to constrain housing-market instability.
        Urbanization management is thus recognized as a governmental priority.
        Given the complexity and the global significance of this task, which
        amounts to the integration of another quarter-billion Chinese into the
        economic mainstream in a little over a decade, there is really no decent
        alternative to remarking – with an absolute minimum of smugness or
        sarcasm – <em>good luck with that</em>.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Even when direct construction expenditures are ignored, by
        systematically raising the level of household consumption, Chinese
        urbanization dominates the country’s macroeconomic landscape. It is no
        great exaggeration to see the emergence of the world’s most dynamic
        consumer economy as a side-effect of a three decade-long urbanization
        process, although – as in any such complex development – the causality
        is turbular, and self-stimulating.The Chinese consumer is a creature of
        the new urban epoch, and an incitement to its further elaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted in the first part of this post, the centrality of urbanization
        to China’s macroeconomic predicament has been explicitly addressed in a
        significant
        <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-05/26/content_28934485.htm">article</a>
        by China’s new premier, Li Keqiang. The conversion of rural folk into
        urbanites (or ‘citizens’ according to strict etymology) is accompanied
        by a 3.6-fold rise in <em>per capita</em> consumption. In addition to
        the purely quantitative impact upon the level of domestic economic
        demand, the rise of urban consumers also drives a qualitative
        transition, characterized above all by the expansion of the service
        sector (in both absolute and relative terms). Li seeks to align
        administrative action with this trend:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Escalating the growth of the service industry is critical to
          adjusting the industrial structure. Effective measures should be taken
          to build a favorable environment for the growth of the service
          industry, both in terms of its size and quality. The government should
          promote the development of production-related service industries such
          as modern logistics, e-commerce and scientific research and design. It
          should also ensure that consumption-related services such as tourism,
          recreation, care of the elderly and domestic services receive a boost,
          and the development of small and mid-sized service companies gets
          support.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Urbanization promotes a more service oriented economic structure, which
        in turn promises to lower the energy-intensity of economic output; raise
        total factor productivity (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity">TFP</a>);
        proliferate
        entrepreneurial small and medium-sized businesses
        (SMEs); accelerate the emergence of knowledge-based and creative
        industries; and increase employment opportunities. In other words, a
        predictable series of dependencies – from urbanization, through
        consumerism, to service-orientation – subordinates economic policy to
        “the objective law of urban development” which alone makes its goals
        realizable. The expansion and improvement of cities will decide whether
        China works.
      </p>
      <p>
        The orchestration of central policy questions under an urban theme is
        also strikingly seen in the area of regional development. Here, too, the
        country’s most intractable problems are to be unlocked by an urban key:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Regional development is closely related to urbanization.
          Less-developed regions lag behind in terms of growth, especially in
          urbanization. In areas which boast mature development conditions and
          large environmental capacity, the government should actively and
          steadily facilitate urbanization by reasonable allocation of
          resources, centralized layout of businesses and encouragement of
          intensive land usage to fire up new engines of growth and enhance the
          local capacity for self-sustained development. The government should
          tailor its regional, industrial and land policies to different regions
          and sectors, rather than adopting general and all-inclusive
          policies.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The infrastructural investment and social policy tools that have been
        employed to ‘Open up the West’ since the turn of the millennium are now
        specifically envisaged as ways to catalyze, accelerate, and guide urban
        development in backward regions. Cities are to be the solution.

        <strong>Capital Absorption</strong>: On the topic of Michael Pettis,
        <a href="http://www.mpettis.com/2013/06/10/how-much-investment-is-optimal/">this</a>
        superb recent article is sure to become an indispensable reference point
        for China economy watchers. Pettis has long argued that Chinese
        investment levels exceed the country’s absorption capacity, and the new
        article places this argument in a broader theoretical framework, which
        he explains with extraordinary lucidity. If he is correct in his basic
        assessment, some widely-held assumptions of development economics will
        require drastic revision, with cultural and institutional factors
        (“social capital”) acquiring far greater prominence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pettis has a deserved reputation for bearishness on Chinese growth
        prospects, but this article makes a guarded case for optimism in regards
        to the country’s development strategy, which he sees shifting from an
        investment-driven growth model to something more
        institutionally-sensitive. This political sub-forecast predicts
        significant movement in the direction of market-oriented reform during
        the Xi-Li period.

        the <em>South China Morning Post</em> (<a href="https://sinocism.com/?p=9776">via</a>):
        <em>Premier Li Keqiang fought open opposition from financial regulators
          in his bid to push through a landmark plan for a free-trade zone in
          Shanghai. It is the clearest sign yet that the nation’s new leadership
          is determined to deliver long-delayed economic reforms. […] The new
          Shanghai free-trade zone plan, officially announced at the beginning
          of July, is expected to be the testing ground for major policy
          reforms. It would promote cross-border commodity and capital flows,
          with key experiments in freeing foreign exchange markets and
          liberalising domestic interest rates.[…] Within two months, Li made an
          initial proposal covering 21 initiatives, whose details were not
          officially announced. These included shortcuts for foreign banks to
          set up subsidiary or joint venture operations and special permission
          for foreign commodities exchanges to own warehouses in the free-trade
          zone in Shanghai … […] … other mainland cities, facing unemployment
          and slower growth, are also keen to follow Shanghai’s move to lure
          foreign capital. But Li is not understood to be interested in rushing
          to copy the Shanghai model for other mainland cities.</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Handle_MZ</strong> commented: “it can be confidently anticipated
        that consumer spending will rise as a function of urbanization,
        contributing automatically to economic re-balancing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I read “The Great Rebalancing” and I think this prediction strangely
        contradicts Pettis’ main narrative. Pettis says that the consumption
        share of Chinese GDP is a necessary function of both the populations
        propensities to save and consume and the whole of Government economic
        policy to include the PBoC’s interest rates, capital<br />
        controls and stabilization of the dollar exchange rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective is sustainable high GDP growth through high levels of
        investment, stable wages, and productive factor capital accumulation —
        especially in the export and tradables sector. A corollary objective is
        improved global competitiveness in markets farther up the value chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        If household consumption is a product of means which seek the above end,
        then any increase in consumption (i.e. from urbanization) that disrupts
        this end will only be met with compensatory government moves that
        push<br />
        it back down. Policy is the unmoved mover of consumption levels. Well,
        slightly moved, but by that aforementioned sustainability criterion. But
        rebalancing cannot occur under the current system unless the<br />
        government is wise enough to support it.

        And at any rate, urbanization creates a surplus of labor which
        suppresses the growth rate of average urban wages. The more urban
        consumption rises (from rising wages, for example), the more attractive
        it is the move from the<br />
        countryside, which also pushes urban wages back down. This helps China’s
        global competitiveness, but may actually reduce domestic consumption
        relative to the less-urbanization counterfactual.

      <p>
        <strong>Admin</strong> response: As you know from previous discussions,
        there are numerous assumptions that need straightening out before
        pushing far with this. At this point, I’m satisfied with the conclusion
        that urbanization is being conceived as a solution to the country’s most
        pronounced economic quandary (at the highest level of the new
        leadership). I think this is quite solid, irrespective of the issues
        that Pettis and you raise. On the latter, though, it seems hard to
        believe that urbanization is incidental to “social capital” formation,
        of the kind that — Pettis argues — raises capital absorption capacity,
        and thus directly contributes to the amelioration of the consumption
        deficiency problem. That’s in addition to the direct consumption effects
        emphasized by Li Keqiang.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t intended as an adequate response to your argument, just a
        provisional rejoinder.

        There’s undoubtedly a Quixotic character to the ‘China should do X’ mode
        of outside commentary, but Yukon Huang’s short <em>Bloomberg</em>
        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-09/china-needs-beijing-to-be-even-bigger.html">article</a>
        advising revision of the country’s urbanization policies represents the
        genre at its best. Noting the agglomeration effects that yield
        disproportionate returns to urban scale, Huang recommends a turn away
        from the proliferation of new minor cities, and towards megacity growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>China is already in a class by itself in accounting for 30 of the 50
          largest cities in east Asia. It boasts half a dozen megacities with
          populations of more than 10 million and 25 “large” cities exceeding 4
          million. In fact, though, the only way China will achieve its desired
          productivity gains is if its leaders allow cities to evolve more
          organically in response to market forces. They need to let cities like
          Beijing get bigger.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Urban concentration creates real problems, but these are
        indistinguishable from the challenges any genuine process of
        socio-economic advance has to confront. The solutions to these problems
        will be the same steps that carry the country forward into unexplored
        territory — beyond ‘catch up’ and into the open horizons of the future.
        Everything learned from concrete economic history suggests that
        technological and business opportunity will be ratcheted upwards by
        exactly those forces which promote megacity agglomeration — and better
        still urban concentration or intensity — to historically unprecedented
        levels. That is how — and where — deep social innovation takes place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-112"></span><em>Instead of actively trying to spread out growth to small new cities,
          China’s planners should embrace the agglomeration economies, which
          militate for larger metropolises. As land and wage costs escalate,
          some industries will eventually gravitate to medium-size cities, but
          services will continue to drive expansion in the larger ones. Smart
          people like to mix with other smart people, and globalization has
          amplified their financial returns. Beijing and Shanghai have continued
          to grow because of buoyant higher-value services, even as their
          manufacturing bases have shrunk. All this explains why in China,
          productivity in urban areas is more than three times that in rural
          areas.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>But aren’t China’s megacities already too big to be sustainable? As a
          matter of fact, some urban specialists have concluded that even
          China’s biggest cities may be too small. They cite “Zipf’s law,” one
          of the great curiosities of urban research. The law, which is
          surprisingly accurate for many countries, claims that the biggest city
          in a country should be about twice the size of the second-biggest,
          three times the size of the third-biggest, and so forth. On this
          basis, China’s largest cities appear too small.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking through power laws (such as Zipf’s) dispels the idea of
        ‘normal’ city sizes. Optimum urban scale is decided by network effects,
        and is dependent upon the entire social ecology — regionally,
        nationally, and even globally. The ‘ideal’ size of Shanghai, for
        instance, cannot be derived from some model of a generic city, but has
        to be understood, instead, with reference to the singular role this city
        plays as a hub in multiple networks — especially commercial webs —
        within which it amasses specialized functions. As these webs expand and
        thicken, their critical nodes tend to grow and intensify spontaneously.
        It is natural, therefore, throughout the process of global
        modernization, for the limits of urban scale to be pushed out ever
        further, in accordance with the functional sophistication of the
        system’s crucial hubs, and the associated refinements of specialization
        these key cities foster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beijing is subject to stubborn environmental constraints, with limited
        water resources prominent among these. Its distance from the coast is
        also a growth-inhibiting factor. Shanghai, in contrast, is destined to
        vastness by such implacable historical forces that it is hard to imagine
        even the most determined policy resistance standing in the way for long.
        As the country’s commercial capital, any realistic power law
        distribution of urban scale begins with Shanghai at the summit. It would
        be best to bend to the inevitable, and let it become the world’s
        laboratory for urban intensity, tracking the advance of modernity into
        the Pacific Century. The rewards for this acceptance would easily
        overwhelm the costs.

      <p>
        The real (paying) job calls. For the last few days of March (and 1st
        April), I’m going to be ‘away’ on a research trip to Kashgar (Xinjiang).
        If connectivity isn’t a problem, ‘away’ might not mean much from the
        perspective of Cyberspace, but I’m expecting at least moderate
        disruption (most probably exacerbated by colorful ethnic distractions
        and horrible torrents of <em>baijiu</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone has any Kashgar questions, or information to offer, I’ll do my
        best to bend my investigations responsively. (I’m not thinking of using
        this blog as a platform for Xinjiang material, but that’s not a dogmatic
        commitment, if there’s any interest in the topic.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="http://www.gluckman.com/Kashgar.html">This</a> short Kashgar
        profile by Ron Gluckman is over a decade old — it will be interesting to
        see how it has dated.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-242"></span>ADDED: If the main things you are searching
        for in life are alcoholic intoxication, coffee, and smooth Internet
        connectivity, Kashgar cannot — in all honesty — be recommended. On the
        positive side of the ledger, there’s far more of the Old Kashgar left
        than first appearance suggests (Otangboyi Road is the place to go,
        following it past the Idkar Mosque to the night market). The Silk Road
        commercial culture still thrives, reaching a truly delirious pitch in
        the Grand Bazaar, which oveflows with sensation-drenching commodities
        from thousands of kilometers around. The tea is delicious — a spiced up
        black tea, drunk without milk, but with a distinct hint of Indian
        <em>chai</em>. Ditto the yoghurt (as thick as cream cheese, with a razor
        sharp edge), and — of course — everything delectable that can be done
        with a dead sheep whilst remaining <em>haram</em>.<br />
        It’s hard to work out the ethnic balance, but it’s at least
        predominantly Uyghur (I’ve seen figures between 70-85%). There’s no
        obvious indications of social tension, with everyone seeming to get on
        with their lives quite frictionlessly, and no signs that I could pick up
        of street-level Han paranoia. Han Chinese women navigate the streets
        alone except for small children, seemingly perfectly relaxed about the
        social environment, and untroubled by any prospect of violence. Our
        group (two Han, one Bulgarian, one Brit, and one Uyghur government guide
        — who is excellent btw) have encountered nothing but friendliness, often
        combined with impressive efforts to sell us stuff. It has to be said,
        though, that the government propaganda is shockingly crude.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a note at the Idkah Mosque, after explaining the history of
        CPC renovation efforts, helpfully explains:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All of it shows fully that Chinese government always pays special
          attentions to the another and historical cultures of the ethnic
          groups, and that all ethnic groups warmly welcome Part’s </em>[sic]
        <em>religious policy. It also shows that different ethnic groups have set
          up a close relationship of equality, unity and helps to each other,
          and freedom of beliefs is protected. All ethnic groups live friendly
          together here. They cooperate to build a beautiful homeland, support
          heartily the unity of different ethnic groups and the unity of our
          country, and oppose the ethnic separatism and illegal religious
          activities.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps it sounds better in the Uyghur.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, at the end of the day I’m a regime apologist. Afghanistan and
        Pakistan are right next door, each demonstrating in their own way the
        wonders of ethno-democratic self-assertion.

        Urumqi this time. I’ll fill things out a little when I get a chance
        (more for my own sake than under any pretence of communication).<br />
        That <em>Baijiu</em> holocaust problem I worried needlessly about in
        Kashgar? Urumqi is a very different city …
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-444"></span>ADDED: After arriving yesterday we took in
        the International Bazaar, a more mall-sructured, and thus rather less
        atmospheric version of the Kashgar Grand Bazaar, trading similar goods.
        The most distinctive items were chunks of fossilized wood, so precisely
        metamorphosed that the minutiae of organic structure were clearly
        discernible. It’s hard not to be impressed when examining the
        fine-grained organization of a thing that died 150,000,000 years ago.<br />
        Next stop was Hong Shan Park, situated at the north-east edge of the
        city in 1947, but now enveloped. It’s high, and gives a vantage point
        from which to get oriented. Better still, the viewing pavilion there
        also serves as an urban development museum, including scale models (1947
        and today), lots of photographs, and basically everything needed for a
        firm space-time fix. Finally, there was dinner with the local officials
        — our hosts — which was great fun (even though I’d been horribly sick
        the day before and still felt shaky). The <em>Baijiu</em> onslaught then
        unfolded (my travel companion from work turned out to be crazily
        <em>lihai</em>, and probably saved me by deflecting some of the white
        death torrent onto herself). Maybe I wrote some scraps fished from the
        gulfs of shadow? Then oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next day: Tarim Mummies, the Urumqi version of Shanghai’s M50 (art hub),
        and the city’s massive new industrial park called the UETD.<br />
        The mummies — dessicated accidentally by the arid environment — are very
        well known, for good reason. Their state of preservation is incredible —
        you could still wear their clothes (after almost 4,000 years). The whole
        anthropo-ethnographic backstory is enthralling too, and I need to try
        and get my head wrapped around it. The oldest mummies are ‘Europoid’ and
        really look as if they could have been Cornish. (Scientific consensus,
        as I understand it tenuously, identifies them as ‘Tokharian’.) This
        throws the Uyghur-Han ethnic elbowing into disconcerting perspective,
        but it’s just too <em>out there</em> to be truly politically sensitive
        (I’m hoping). If the Welsh start claiming chunks of Xinjiang based on
        ancestral rights I guess that could change. The old mummies come in two
        pairs, two 3,800-y.o. females, both ‘Europoid’, then a pair from a
        thousand years later, a Europoid male and a mixed Euro-Mongoloid female.
        Both of these later mummies are tattooed, and for reasons not yet
        understood were buried with non-matching boots. Then the exhibition
        throws in a mummified Han official from AD500, but if you folllow the
        exhibition around in a disciplined counter-clockwise circuit, there’s no
        reason to be thrown off by this bizarre and crudely-motivated
        <em>non sequitur</em>.<br />
        The art space had some OK stuff, and reflected the guiding Urumqi
        attitude: well-meaning, relentlessly multi-cultural, driven by Han, and
        extremely tame. If you like art that drags you into extra-cosmic abysses
        of shock and dread, there wasn’t much there to set the pulse racing.
        Lots of pleasant, (unthreateningly) intelligent, traditional,
        craft-based stuff though.<br />
        The industrial park was really something. Pure China, in the sense that
        it was mostly a (truly immense) construction site, from which some
        slender threads of raw potential had tumbled backwards into the present.
        It already has a population of 270,000, and looked roughly 10% complete.
        This ‘Park’ — an entire urban district until a few years ago, when it
        was re-purposed — is programmed to become a glstening science-fiction
        entity that would over-awe 70%+ of the world’s cities (with most of the
        remaining 30% being Chinese). We saw a truck plant and the local
        Coca-Cola operation — full of clattering robotic bottling machinery —
        and got to ask some questions about the bases of Xinjiang growth. The
        impression we got is that serving the wider Central Asian market is the
        cornerstone of everybody’s plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: Six hours on the road and — just to keep things moving forwards
        smoothly — a two hour visit to a <em>baijiu</em> factory in the middle
        (plus a lot of other stuff). Two bottles of sample (non-retail maximum
        strength) rocket fuel in my bag, and four hours sleep to cling onto.
        Beyond the lesson that Shariah isn’t exactly calling the shots in
        northern Xinjiang, analysis and reflection is going to be delayed.

        Whatever the prejudices you might harbor against Urumqi Internet
        connections in second rate hotels, they’re probably over-generous. I’ve
        been effectively de-twitterized by sheer technological crappitude rather
        than anything more sinister, but this channel seems to be (barely) OK.
        (Annoyingly, they provide a computer in the room, which locks everything
        into chronic dysfunction.) So apologies for the deteriorated state of
        communications over the next few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main objective of this trip is to explore Xinjiang’s Buddhist
        heritage, which is so vast and rich that even some superficial
        scratching should turn up some interesting stuff. The main current of
        Buddhist influence into China passed this way, hybridizing wildly with
        other cultures in one of the world’s great mixing zones. After arriving
        off the steps, the Uyghurs were Buddhist for centuries, before Islam got
        a grip around the turning point of the first millennium (I’ll try to
        fill in some dates with greater precision later on).
      </p>
      <p>Updates as events, energy, and time permit.</p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1294"></span>ADDED: Scheduled to arrive at the site of
        interest tomorrow. Up to now, it’s been a mix of some interesting stuff
        (but probably not <em>Outside in </em>material — weird Uyghur dances
        with cups of water balanced on heads? I didn’t think so), Internet
        nightmare (Twitter inaccessible again), and grand finale: the mandatory
        <em>baijiu</em>-crazed ‘austere-enough-for government-work’ welcoming
        banquet. The inebriated babble effect is no doubt obvious. We saw some
        astounding Tianshan vistas too (‘Tianshan Grand Canyon’ — don’t be put
        off by the ridiculous name), but I’m hopeless at natural wonder, so I
        won’t even try to communicate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re in Baicheng now. I’ll be impressed if anyone’s heard of it, bt it
        seems shockingly well-governed, and probably the most attractive modern
        city in Xinjiang. For us, it’s just the gateway out to the Buddha caves,
        but it’s been an interesting surprise. It’s prosperous — due to
        petrochemicals — well-designed, seems highly livable, and it’s partnered
        with Wenzhou (which you should have heard of), a relationship that has
        been very effectively milked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hotel is a beautiful Jiangnan-style place, which also came as a
        serious shock. We’d expected we were on the way down from the Urumuqi
        quarters to something seriously dire, but instead find ourselves in one
        of the nicest hotels in Xinjiang — and that does actually mean really
        nice. Still no reliable Internet connectivity though (by which I mean
        the opportunity to run my VPN), so the twitter shakes are getting bad.
        [If Spandrell’s out there — I’m not hiding from your ruthless tweet-fu
        logic, my tongue’s been cut out.]

      <p>
        Over the next few days I’ll be in Guizhou, known for its karst
        landscapes, insanely spicy food, and comparative poverty. The computer
        is coming — but so are the kids, so blogging is likely to be erratic at
        best. It’s going to be a test of my <em>Outside in</em> addiction, and
        one that I’m already failing … digit tremors and threads of mild
        delirium are creeping in, and I haven’t left the house (or keyboard)
        yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-420"></span>ADDED: As Spandrell points out in the
        comments, ethnic complexity should have been added to the list of main
        Guizhou promotion points. There are a whole bunch of ‘minorities’ here,
        of whom the Miao are probably the best known, and exotic ‘tribal’
        clothing (especially impractically-ornate head-dresses) are easy to spot
        even in the metropolis — more as attractions in shops and restaurants
        than on the street. The tribals are obviously little folk, giving the
        province a land-of-the-pixies feel. We’ve yet to see any foreigners
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re still in Guiyang, the provincial capital, which might be the
        smallest Chinese city we’ve ever seen — just 1.2 million according to
        our (highly untrustworthy) guidebook. I pretty much always like Chinese
        cities, and this one — whilst definitely odd — is no exception. The
        architecture is only tenuously sane, consisting in large part of highly
        eclectic experiments in variants of hybrid Chinese modernism, or an
        oneiric re-visitation of global architectural history spliced with
        Chinese characteristics. Unconvincingly restored Ming complexes co-exist
        with space-ship roofed towers and grandiose domed edifices from an
        imagined 1920s. They’re doing something ambitious with the river, but
        it’s hard to quite tell what.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent the morning at Qianling Park, right at the edge of the city,
        and an amazing place to visit. Forested misty hills, covered in obscure
        Buddhist carvings, with the province’s largest temple at the top.
        Thousands of monkeys populate the park, and even though some of these
        now form a welfare-dependent semi-criminal underclass, they were still
        the best-behaved wild simians we’ve yet encountered — fearless,
        dignified, entertaining, and pacific. (There was no sign of the ‘heavy
        begging’ we’ve encountered among macaques elsewhere in China — let alone
        among the terrifying monkey gangs in India — and I’m putting that down
        to the Buddhist influence.)
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: Anshun, the gateway into central Guizhou, is a scruffy town of
        roughly 400,000. Our hotel — The Triumphal (seriously) — was supposedly
        a 4-star, everything about it was vaguely dysfunctional, and the Chintz
        aesthetics were like needles in the eyeballs. (The room included its own
        Internet-connected computer, which meant that both the machine and the
        connection were scarcely endurable.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Once out into the scenic areas (no easy task), the squalor and hassle
        was thoroughly redeemed. We were ‘doing’ geology rather than
        ethnography, so the main cultural stimulus was provided by Miao grannies
        selling cucumbers and boiled eggs to the tourists (all Chinese, as far
        as we could tell). The area around Huangguoshu — where a new city has
        been built on (tourist industry) spec. — is dominated by vast, rugged,
        karst tracts: canyons, caverns, sculpted mountain-pillars, and
        brutally-sliced cliffs, cross-cut by innumerable waterways and small
        lakes. It’s truly stunning.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high point for us was passing behind the Huangguoshu Great Waterfall
        (Dapubu), climbing through a series of winding limestone caves that
        broke out intermittently into open ledges, in front of which the largest
        waterfall in Asia deluged downwards thunderously. We’d already explored
        the mind-melting Tianxing area earlier in the day [insert karst
        landscape superlatives here] and were bouncing against the outer limits
        of stimulation absorption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Philosophical stimulation? One curiosity of special note (at Tianxing)
        had the English label ‘The Root of the Human Race’ — it was indeed a
        root, of some old, tough rock-clinging creeper, but it only really made
        sense in Chinese, because “Human Race” translated the character ‘ren’
        (very roughly an inverted ‘V’), and what was being described was a
        rising cascade of converging connections. The ‘ren’ ideogram is
        sometimes explained as an image of convergence, so the Tianxing root was
        radicalizing [sic] a pre-existing conception, but one that blatantly
        contradicts the dominant image of human ancestry — whether Darwinian or
        Biblical — as a ‘tree’ diverging from a single root. It has the
        potential to be upsetting in all kinds of ways, so I’ve reserved this
        creeper a stretch of undistracted attention sometime soon …

        Latest travel distraction is the world capital of the
        technocommercialists. Of course, it’s a city that I adore to the edge of
        brain-stem seizure. Just seeing the Kowloon container port is almost
        enough to persuade one that the process on this planet is actually going
        OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naively, I had expected that Mandarin would have made some obvious
        inroads since the last time I was here (roughly six years ago). No sign
        of that, though. It’s quite stunning how much English there is here, and
        the extent to which English remains the default alternative to
        Cantonese. That has to have important implications in respect to the
        cultural foundations of Hong Kong autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expeditionary inertialization due to exhausted children prevented
        exploration getting off the ground today. Nothing too adventurous is
        likely to happen, but I’ll try to record a few sporadic notes here. Hong
        Kong is an iconic city, with an exceptional intensity of sociopolitical
        meaning,  so it should be possible to discuss — and even argue about —
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m only here (with family) for a few days, then returning to Shanghai
        for six weeks of solitary, extremely high-intensity production. After
        Thursday, if anybody has extravagant demands to make, it’s the time to
        make them. Whatever is ever going to be possible should be possible
        soon. Most likely, I’ll learn some crushing lessons about project
        feasibility, because all my excuses will be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-682"></span>ADDED: Hong Kong has to be a critically
        important example for the development of the sovereignty discussion.
        It’s almost certainly the freest society in the world, whilst quite
        clearly under the sovereignty of a nation that, even to its its most
        ardent defenders, equally certainly isn’t. Perhaps this doesn’t rise to
        the level of a paradox. After all, up until 1997, when it served
        (retrospectively) as a crucial case of the neoreactionary thesis —
        distinguishing liberty and democracy with extreme clarity — the
        structure was not altogether different. Even then, the colonial
        metropolis was evidently pitched at a far lower level of liberty than
        its comparatively small, powerless, and insultingly disposable
        possession. Given the international image of the PRC, however, it would
        surely be hard to argue that the peculiarity had not been exacerbated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Hong Kong, the PRC ‘oversees’  an outpost that operates as a zone of
        uninhibited reflection upon its ideologically hyper-sensitive
        motherland. There are many ways to explore this. It connects with the
        larger issue of Cantonese ethnic self-consciousness —  a topic of truly
        immense significance for China’s medium-term future. It has important
        academic and media dimensions. It also shapes the concrete reality of
        China’s engagement with the world, especially in its most
        ‘deterritorialized’  or cosmo-capitalist dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this trip, the area which brought it most into focus was the visual
        arts. Most particularly, a fascinating exhibition at the Asia Society
        Hong Kong Center called
        <em>Light before Dawn: Unofficial Chinese Art 1974-1985</em>. This show
        covered material that might have been found in Shanghai today, except
        what would have been explored approximately, cautiously, and with
        nervous cunning in Shanghai, was brought together brazenly and (for
        anyone habituated to mainland cultural norms) provocatively in Kong
        Kong. The message of the exhibition was stark: Socialist Realism was
        benighted, and the cultural escape from the command economy era was a
        liberation from totalitarian night. The three decades from 1949-79 were
        a horror story, from which China has been released. It scarcely needs to
        be said that this is not a narrative in conformity with the ‘official’
        PRC storyline of Reform and Opening, and its historical meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting aside the details of the show, for the moment, the questions it
        raises concern Hong Kong, China, sovereignty, and cultural autonomy.
        Does China surreptitiously appreciate this offshore zone of critical
        leverage? Does it merely tolerate Hong Kong’s role as gadfly, due to the
        preeminence of other factors, and interests? (Chinese mainland
        capitalism clearly makes massive use of the ‘One Country Two Systems’
        arrangement, in many different ways.) How functional is a peripheral
        zone of exorbitant freedom, considered abstractly, as an appendage to
        large-scale authoritarian social structures in general? Could this be
        the way that a rational apparatus of power realistically discriminates,
        eagerly seizing upon an invaluable exemption from impractical
        universalism? That is what <em>Outside in</em> suspects.

      <p>
        My Vietnam is like my China: accessed from the South, from the
        mega-urban, commercial culture, and from pre-communist traditions. It’s
        very much the view from Saigon (and that isn’t something I regret).
        Saigon would be a great place to live (in small part because the idea of
        calling it Ho Chi Minh City is a transparent joke).
      </p>
      <p>
        Doi Moi looks like it should work a lot like Gaige Kaifeng (as a local
        version of generic ‘Reform and Opening’ in a ‘Market Leninist’ regime) —
        but it doesn’t seem to be quite working out. If rationalized
        corruptocracy is close to ideal limit of effective government among
        large states, Vietnam seems to have managed the corruptocracy far better
        than the rationalization. Infrastructure development — the magic sauce
        of recent Chinese hyper-growth — has not reached ignition. The country
        is too small to fund its own ambitions, and too chaotically kleptocratic
        to bring in foreign investment on the scale required. Despite many
        excellent things going for it, the country is floundering with a morose
        economic spirit that is almost Western.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1953"></span>Vietnamese coffee is among the most sublime
        offerings this tortured planet supplies. Thick, dark, and massively
        caffeinated, it makes a Starbucks brew seem like dishwater. One cup and
        the flight has paid for itself, as far as the utilitarian calculus is
        concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        A visit to Saigon’s fine arts museum is a grave disappointment. The
        building is a beautiful colonial structure, but the contents — once
        despicable trash had been ceremoniously burned — would fill a small
        room. There’s no way Vietnam will be setting the world art market on
        fire in the immediate future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cao Dai is very strange. Created as a new religion in 1926, with the
        obvious brief to make spiritual sense of Vietnam’s peculiar position
        with cultural history and geography, it canonized Victor Hugo and Sun
        Yat-sen as signatories of “the third alliance between God and man”
        (after Moses and Jesus). Cao Dai’s Masonic founder, Nguyen Gia Tri,
        rounded out the new sacred triumvirate.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I saw an eye” was the way my seven-year-old daughter recorded her
        experience of the main Cao Dai temple. That would be the Sauronic Cosmic
        Eye, repeated obsessively as a motif, overlooking the white-robed
        devotees during their observances. The quantity of lurid symbolism is
        quite overwhelming. For anybody with the slightest attachment to a
        restrained religious tradition, the effect would be one of unbridled
        spiritual chaos. Apparently good natured, and seriously interesting,
        though.

        Siem Reap (Cambodia) is a scruffily exotic town that never threatens to
        over-stretch the adjective bank. For anyone who has been out of the
        tropics for a while, it’s charming enough, and the locals are pleasant,
        dignified folk. Our hotel, with its hints of French colonial heritage
        and lush foliage is more than OK (as long as you don’t make the mistake
        of testing their catering capabilities). Siem Reap, however, is just a
        jump-off point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Angkor sites, in contrast, incinerate all available positive
        adjectives within seconds, threatening speechlessness. It’s absolutely
        necessary to assume a front-rank wonders-of-the-world baseline in what
        follows, with awe-struck mind-melt accepted as the default perceptual
        mode (in the absence of, and in addition to, any explicit
        qualification). There might be more stunning spectacles to be found on
        this earth, but that would require a serious argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1969"></span>The Angkor temples were constructed over a
        period of 630 years, reaching a climactic golden age of architectural
        production in the 14th and early 15th centuries. Go read a history book
        (I still need to).
      </p>
      <p>
        Angkor Thom is an entire temple city, with large tracts of rain forest
        within its walls, and a moat of lake-like scale without. One
        architectural feature well worth noting at an early stage follows from
        the fact that the Khmers never mastered the arch, so their internal
        spaces have a massy, geological character, often rising to impressive
        heights, but without culminating vaults. Technically, therefore, it is a
        kind of anti-gothic, ascending through sheer mountainous upsurge of
        stacked stone, rather than gravity-defying structure. It is if the earth
        were imperiously commanded to soar, without the slightest hint of
        sublimation into anything other than itself. These are fabulously
        sculpted artificial mountains — sacred mesas. According to my guidebook,
        there are 11,000 carved figures and 1.2km of bas reliefs on the Bayon —
        the core of Angkor Thom. These carvings were detailed to the level of
        fine textile design on the skirts of miniature dancers, while including
        giant enigmatic faces several meters across (and in great number).
      </p>
      <p>
        Angkor Wat is not only a monumental aesthetic composition, but also an
        enthralling philosophical puzzle. As befits the final days of the snake
        year, it is a symbolic complex strung together by nagas. These
        seven-headed serpent monsters are arrayed around the site as guardians,
        rearing up from the end of every balustrade. They also figure
        prominently on the series of huge, continuous bas reliefs that wrap the
        main structure, and — truly provocatively — provide hoods for numerous
        Buddha statues throughout the site. (Angkor Wat is thought to be devoted
        primarily to Vishnu, with Buddhism present as a later arrival.) This
        hissing religious insidiousness needs futher attention at a future
        point.

      <p>(Five-headed nagas are atypical — this one was found at Ta Prohm.)</p>
      <p>
        The third prominent naga moment occurs on the most revered of the bas
        reliefs, which depicts the ‘stirring of the ocean of milk’. A quick step
        back first …
      </p>
      <p>
        Viewed panoramically, Angkor Wat epitomizes timeless serenity. Close
        examination of its narrative carvings, however, reveals an obsession
        with war. Armies clash, and parade, on earth and in the heavens. Even
        the torments of the underworld have the character of military atrocity —
        stabbings, slashings, and impalings. The cosmos depicted tends to a
        slaughterhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here that the naga key can be inserted. The stirring of the ocean
        of milk (the Milky Way?) is a tug-of-war between gods and demons — a
        cosmic war, therefore, whose thread is the vast naga Vasuki, whose body
        is stretched across a hundred meters (?) of delicately-carved display
        space. Crucially, a central pivot, consisting of Mount Mandala resting
        upon the body of Vishnu in turtle-form, converts this conflictual
        back-and-forth into rotary dynamism — appropriating war to a celestial
        function …

        ADDED: The third temple in the core of the Angkor complex is Ta Prohm.
        For sheeraesthetic rapture, it might be the most stunning. (I’m going to
        add some snaps as soon as bandwidth considerations allow that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Ta Prohm has been shattered and devoured by the jungle, with broken
        masonry fused (at once beautifully and hideously) with monstrous trees.
        It thus vividly presents a hard collision between culture and nature in
        the starkest possible terms. The trees conducting the slow-motion
        assault are known locally as ‘spung’ (botanically: tetramelesnudiflora).
        No director could have chosen better assailants than these behemoths,
        with massive, twisting roots. It was obvious from this spectacle that
        trees do tentacle horror even more impressively than cephalopods, if
        allowance is made for the inhuman time factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        An almost equally superb example of semi-digested cyclopean civilization
        is found at Beng Mealea, a two-hour tuk tuk ride away, through
        jungle-fringe countryside. The heritage preservation problems of
        intervening in this titanic clash are fascinating to contemplate. How
        does one appropriately restore — or merely save — an intricately-carved
        shrine half-eaten by a colossal tree? Is a formula even imaginable?

        The Angkor remains tend to overwhelm the experience of the country —
        probably as the pharonic remains of ancient Egypt do there. The better
        half raised some thought-provoking points about the situation. A regime
        based on god-king sovereignty, caste, and war — hardcore even by the
        wildest imaginings of contemporary reactionaries, therefore (and with no
        hint of ‘neo-’ in sight) — created a legacy that continues to support
        the country six centuries after the collapse of the Khmer kingdom. How
        does this affect calculations of social order, economics, and time? It
        certainly inclines the mind toward illiberal musings.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Cambodian money is a study in the contemporary world order. In Siem
        Reap, especially, the economy is fully dollarized. The local currency,
        the Riel, is worth USD0.00025, and we never came across a note worth
        more than 25 cents until leaving SR. Riels were used as change
        (compensating for the absence of US specie). Seignorage bitchez.
        Everyone says it doesn’t amount to much in aggregate, but the symbolism
        is certainly something.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Kampot, we threw a chunk of the local economy into chaos trying to
        break a 10 dollar bill. The first group of street traders we approached
        had no idea whar it was (might as well have been some kind of arcane
        futures contract). It was only when we got into the center of town that
        ‘money’ and ‘small change’ became differentiable concepts?
      </p>
      <p><span id="more-1990"></span>***</p>
      <p>
        The whole ‘Khmer Rouge accelerated dysgenics’ idea makes a lot of sense,
        conceptually, but the locals seem competent enough on the evidence
        provided by casual exposure. Given where the country has been, it seems
        to be doing OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second HBDish (or as we say ‘Spandrellish’) point raised in respect
        to the Vietnamese was ‘tropical work habits’ — I’ll plead agnosticism,
        while reluctantly noting that Siem Reap contained the first “6-11s” I’ve
        ever seen …
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Cambodian politics? Not much new information really, except (1) the
        state of media openness seems quite high (for better and for worse,
        given the chronic Cathedralism of the contemporary journalistic mind),
        and (2) the pervasive promotion of the Cambodian People’s Party is
        recognizably ‘communist’ in its indifference to the pseudo-binary
        balance recognized by friend and foe alike as the hegemonic global norm.
        Going out on a limb, I’d hazard that the country is doing well by
        effectively suppressing anything beyond nominal democracy, but the
        pressure to deteriorate will only get worse.

        Being disconnected in stages is a new experience. All connectivity
        disappeared at 9pm last night (or so) — it wasn’t something I
        appreciated. Satellite-linked neuro-embedded chip? Yes please.

        US$6,000. Enough space to grow pepper, mangoes, papaya, bananas, keep
        some chickens, some cows — that’s really good money, cows.”<br />
        Us: “It sounds like a lot of work.”<br />
        TTD: “No problem! Cambodian people would do all the work. You could just

        have not been defaced by reinforced concrete. The southern group has
        been externally ruined by Zhou Enlai (although he seems to have meant

        If it were not that ‘modernity’ (also) connoted friction and nostalgia,
        would there be any hesitation in describing Shenzhen as the most modern
        city in the world? It is nothing beyond what the opportunities of the
        present era have enabled it to be — a uniquely unambiguous urban seizure
        of the global now. (<em>Urban Future</em> adores this place to the edge
        of neurological catastrophe.)

        Shenzhen, and Huaqiang Bei in particular, places absolutely unapologetic
        euphoric commoditization on display. This is the world’s Gizmoverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one can have even the faintest idea how massively electronic
        production differentiates into lineages, species, sub-species, and
        minutely subtle varieties, until they wander through these markets.
        Combining innovative variation, replication at mind-melting scales, and
        fierce commercial selection (expressed through adaptive minutiae of
        product specification and price), the ecological analogy — based on
        fabulously complex networks of competition and cooperation — is
        irresistible. The electronic jungle is open to exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each product line opens niches for others. Not only are there dazzling
        multitudes of mobile phone types — an entire phylum now, honing
        classical forms, and branching off chaotically down lines of mutation —
        but also symbiotc industries for phone cases (“protective shells”),
        stands, re-chargers, input and output accessories, cables and
        connectors, each assertively seizing its patches of commercial display
        space.

        The Huaqiang Bei outlets are described as ‘factory shops’ — sheer
        industrial exuberance jutting into exchange space. As an indicator, bulk
        discounts are the norm. Buy a single gizmo of any kind and the deal is

        <span id="more-3584"></span>Our hotel is in Huaqiang Bei, the center of
        the Shenzhen electronic market zone. The area is packed with emporia,
        which are in turn packed with products — and more specifically
        <em>commodities</em>. Rather than masking the traits of commercial
        mass-production under a veneer of ’boutique’ rarity, the Shenzhen spirit
        is most gloriously manifested in the naked exhibition of
        hyper-alienated, techno-proliferated, trade-format <em>volumes</em>.
        Chips (of all kinds) come in sheets, which are then stacked into piles,
        and tessalated into display places designed to minutely explore minimal
        differences (product micro-specifications and volume-linked price
        slices). This is capitalism. It’s easy — in a decline-phase Westernized
        world — to forget what it looks like.

        Currently in a gothic inspiration — the Otira Hotel — just beyond
        Arthur’s Pass. Bought for one million dollars, along with the whole
        village of forty houses. It’s on the rail-line, but remained on the
        market for years because:<br />
        1) It’s a Gold Rush ghost town with no economic base<br />
        2) It’s deep in a valley that plunges it into permanent shadow for half
        the year<br />
        3) There’s a massive quake due (on the fault-line it straddles) which is
        expected to destroy everything<br />
        The new owners have stuffed the hotel bar with Gold Rush antiques,
        taxidermy specimens, the first telegraph cable, freaky life-size
        marionettes … it should be getting dark for the full effect (but it
        isn’t yet) …

        On an Internet ration tonight (Dec. 27.), but I’m going to try to keep
        this alive — meaning updates undramatized by an ‘ADDED’. Also pics (but
        some slight time lag likely there).

        The NZ west coast is dominated by a near-continuous strip of temperate
        rain forest, blurring into sub-tropical rain forest in the north. The
        peculiar local vegetation, including numerous species of giant ferns,
        give the landscape a prehistoric flavor. It’s also extremely rugged,
        with the western slopes of the NZ alps cascading right down to the
        coast. The sea is brutal, and the coastline deeply mauled. The early
        exploration of this area was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Brunner">tough</a>. It’s
        conspicuously Gnon-tinged geography. (Patience needed on the pix front,
        apologies.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Only 30,000 people live on the west coast of the South Island — and most
        of them are trying with greater or lesser urgency to leave. The
        landscape is glorious (the British Columbia comparison is inescapable).
        Once drone logistics make it viable to survive in web-linked isolation
        in this area, it’s going to make a spectacular refuge. For the moment,
        it’s populated by hippies, hill-billies, and extraction-industry social
        detritus (a great horror fiction mix, however — drugs, guns, and
        expendables).

    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        <em></em>No one really denies that Singapore is the most functional
        society on earth, which is interesting in itself. Everything works here
        (even multiculturalism (of which they have the superior Confucian
        hegemony version, rather than the ethno-masochistic late-Christian
        fiasco)). Practical civilization reaches its zenith in the orchid zone
        of the Singapore botanic gardens, or somewhere close to it. This drives
        a lot of people — even those who profoundly admire the place — into a
        sulfurous rage.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one likes an apple-polisher of Gnon (or scarcely anyone, I’m
        exempting myself, along with a few others). By demonstrating social
        functionality, Singapore makes everyone look bad, which doesn’t go down
        well. <em>The Sings make us all look like useless scum</em>. Yes, there
        is that.
      </p>
      <p>Conversation snippets:</p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-4423"></span>“How much crime is there in Singapore?”<br />
        “Not much. I saw a sign saying ‘Warning! Five bicycles have been stolen
        from this area in the last three years.’ People were leaving them there
        unlocked.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ve known a lot of Singaporeans, but I’ve never really had a
        Singaporean friend. … If you’re used to going out on a Friday night,
        getting hammered, and waking up in the morning feeling like crap, it’s
        hard. No one does that here. The Singaporeans are sensible all the
        freaking time …”
      </p>
      <p>
        The stairwell door to the apartment where we’re staying has a biometric
        identification system (plus two redundant human security guards).
      </p>
      <p>
        The demographic problem — I’m increasingly convinced — is hugely about
        education costs (in money and time). It’s k-selection catastrophe.
        That’s a can to be kicked down the road for the time being, though,
        because no one has a solid solution to offer right now. Mentioned here
        because it’s deep, highly general, and the
        <em>only criticism of Singapore that deserves to be taken remotely
          seriously</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.5 million citizens, and 1.5 million permanent residents. (‘PRs’ are
        obligated to do national military service.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll try to update this further (and if I was Singaporean I’d almost
        certainly deliver).

        Paradox prompts thought. Arriving at the unthinkable after proceeding,
        step-by-step, along the path of reason, unsettles comfortable mental
        routines and points – obscurely – towards something new. Nothing twists
        this prompt more intensely than time-paradox, which grates thought open
        upon the basic tangles of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main creative current of Shanghai visual arts grasps this
        instinctively. Whilst predictably multidimensional (and in other
        respects unpredictable), the work revealed by Shanghai artists and art
        spaces gravitates distinctively towards themes and techniques that can
        be plausibly described as <em>neo-traditionalist</em>. This inherently
        paradoxical inclination is itself a deep tradition, with relevance far
        beyond the visual arts and knotted roots that can be traced back to the
        Song Dynasty.

        <span id="more-28"></span>At the Shanghai Himalayas Museum Inaugural

          href="http://www.randian-online.com/np_event/insightful-chrisma-inaugural-exhibition-of-shanghai-himalayas-museum/">Exhibition</a>
        (scheduled to last until the end of September), this neo-traditionalist
        tendency is represented with unprecedented scope and penetration.
        Entitled <em>Yi Xiang</em> (意象) in Chinese, it has been translated
        (lamentably) into ‘Insightful Charisma’ in English, but this is only a
        minor tripping point. (‘Meaning Manifested’ would have been far
        superior.) <em>Yi Xiang</em>, or the tension between essentials and
        their expression, echoes China’s
        <a
          href="http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/tien-hsia.php?searchterm=025_sinophone.inc&amp;issue=025">historic</a>
        neo-traditionalist response to the challenge of modernization, as
        formulated during the Qing and Republican period: ‘Chinese learning as
        essence, Western learning as application’ (<em>Zhongxue wei ti, Xixue wei yong</em>, 中学为体，西学为用). Further
        scattered
        echoes of this deep impulse –
        to guarded assimilation – can be heard, preserved even through
        superficial inversion, in such recent expressions as ‘Socialism with
        Chinese characteristics’.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yi Xiang</em> is a complex exhibition, divided into five sections,
        each labeled by a single Chinese character. Threaded through each is a
        neo-traditionalist current, modulated in different ways. This is most
        economically grasped as a refusal to decide between past and future,
        tradition and modernity, but to aesthetically stress both together, in a
        single cryptic direction. The inevitable consequence is a
        time-scrambling artistic (and curatorial) jolt, which simultaneously
        progresses into the past and regresses into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The show is self-consciously refracted through China’s landscape
        tradition of <em>shanshui</em> (山水) – literally: ‘mountain, water’ –
        the aesthetic fusion of the rigid and the fluid, permanence and change,
        stability and flux. <em>Shanshui</em> is extended beyond scenic
        representation into a method of historical reflection, exploring an
        intricate time-scape of modifications, appropriations, blockages,
        deluges, accommodations, and adaptations. The sweep of this insight more
        than suffices, on its own, to justify the entire exhibition. (I should
        note, however, that one brilliant but determinedly contrarian
        commentator has interpreted this focus upon <em>shanshui</em> as an
        evasion of <em>fengshui</em>, arguably bypassed due to its politically
        awkward associations with ‘feudal superstition’.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shen</em> (神) or ‘spirit’ is housed in a single softly illuminated
        gallery, filled with classic <em>Shanshui</em> works from the Qing,
        Ming, and even Song dynasties, along with a smaller number of early
        modern pieces directly inspired by them. This exquisite, compact
        sub-exhibition elegantly illustrates the way in which the modernization
        of tradition is itself a tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Li</em> (理) or ‘reason’ (a term with rich Neo-Confucian
        reverberations) is devoted to ‘Chinese Cube’: an explicitly
        philosophical uptake of the classic <em>Yijing</em> into a variety of
        modern codes, translating tradition into a recursive, cryptographic
        puzzle box.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Qi</em> (气) or ‘internal force’ (‘familiar’ through the
        <em>Dao</em> and Traditional Chinese Medicine), is the largest part of
        the show, consisting of cutting-edge works presented within a coherent,
        neo-traditionalist curatorial context. The quality of the work displayed
        is outstanding, including pieces by Li Hongto, Shao Yan, Wang Jieyin,
        Wang Tiande, Yang Yongliang (and Ma Haiping), and many others. (I hope
        to return to these artists in future posts.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Jing</em> (境) or ‘imagery’ is devoted to architecture, with the
        neo-traditionalist theme partially displaced into a negotiation between
        nature and urban construction. The visionary work of
        <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/index.php/10-ma-yansong">Ma Yansong </a>dominates this part of the show.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yun</em> (韵) or ‘rhythm’, with its musical sub-theme, pursues the
        involvements of mountains and water more determinedly than any other
        part of the show. A complex work by Ding Yi is perhaps the center-piece
        of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neo-traditionalism is the main driver of China’s cultural renaissance,
        and the manifested meaning of its greatest aesthetic delights.
        <em>Urban Future</em> will be returning to it as frequently as
        practically possible.

      <h2>Neo-Traditionalism in Hong Kong</h2>
      <p>
        <em>The momentum of modernization is directly proportional to the
          restoration of tradition</em>
        (discuss).
      </p>
      <p>
        Abundant evidence relevant to this thesis is on show in Hong Kong, at
        two art exhibitions of exceptional interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Hong Kong Museum of Art,
        <em>The Origin of Dao: New Dimensions in Chinese Contemporary Art</em>
        (curated by Pi Daojian, open until August 18) exemplifies the infolding
        of audacious experimentation into profoundly conservative aesthetic
        commitments. The show is divided into two parts. One includes works in a
        variety of media, and is moderately stimulating. The other, devoted
        entirely to recent ink works (with supporting video) is truly
        outstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Works by Yang Jiechang, Gu Wenda, Zhang Quan, Shao Yan, Kan Tai-Keung,
        Qiu Zhijie, and others, excavate the creative potentialities of
        traditional Chinese media and forms, propelling them into a dazzling
        variety of new horizons. One especially conspicuous theme is the fluid
        boundary between text and image inherited from the Chinese script,
        evoking meandering lines of exploration, elaborated in the cryptic gulf
        between pictorial representation and intelligible sign. The
        modernization of native aesthetic tradition progressively liberates
        these lines — whether broken or unbroken — from both resemblance and
        significance, on a path of escape into pure form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shao Yan demonstrates this trend with particular vividness, through the
        creation of ink abstracts poised between calligraphy and landscape. An
        accompanying video shows Shao at work, like a <em>gongfu</em> Pollock,
        realizing a type of Chinese action painting that draws upon the occult
        root of cultivation (anticipated by the equation of calligraphy and
        sword-fighting depicted in Zhang Yimou’s <em>Hero</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Hong Kong Asia Society,
        <em>Light before Dawn: Unofficial Chinese Art 1974-1985</em> (through to
        September 1) concerns the liberation of Chinese art from the constraints
        of Socialist Realism, as shown through the work of the Caocao, Wuming,
        and Xingxing artists. From both a Neo-Traditionalist and Shanghai
        perspective, the Caocao Society works are especially significant,
        consisting of ink paintings that explicitly (and provocatively) revive
        artistic impulses which had been ideologically proscribed due to their
        associations with the Confucian literati. Qiu Deshu’s masterpiece
        <em>3-5 Times Shouting</em> (1980) steals the show.

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        When art history invokes the ‘contemporary’, it refers to <i>now</i>,
        the current moment, and thus points into an unresolved perplexity.
        <i>Now</i> remains undefined, whether by science, philosophy, or
        mystical religion. Our contemporary ‘now’ is not merely an instant — not
        even a stretched or dilated instant. It is a time that is still with us,
        or which we continue to participate in, at once proximate and elusive,
        still awaiting its sense, obliquely intersecting the narrower present of
        chronological location and practical schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visual arts, at their most reflective, enter into this perplexity as
        into an animating spiral. Whilst succumbing to categorization — or time
        definition — within a still obscure and incomplete contemporaneity, the
        art work can also make the act of definition its own, reaching out into
        the <i>now</i>, and telling us what it has found. In doing so it tests
        itself against an ultimate abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some such now, current but chronologically indeterminable, Chinese
        visual art encountered a critical threshold. The difference between
        heading forward or backward, advancing or retreating, ceased – at some
        ‘point’ — to be an option, or a choice. Instead, for that complex
        cultural trend <i>and</i> inheritance at once defined as — and defining
        — <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/?p=28"><i>neotraditionalism</i></a>, true modernity was discovered in the
        acceptance of tradition
        <i>as a path</i>. This wave of creative – even explosive –
        experimentation was also an excavation, and a recovery. It demonstrated
        that innovative variation was inextricable from the
        <i>maintenance of a course</i>, directed into a future already
        cryptically indicated by the past.

        <i>Beyond Black and White: Chinese Contemporary Abstract Ink</i>, on
        show at Pearl Lam Galleries (until September 7, 2013), focuses with
        glorious intensity upon the neotraditionalist current. In keeping with
        this focus, it both fulfills and deranges expectations, through the
        audacious explorations of a heritage made new.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-63"></span>The exhibition poises itself between a number
        of dynamically balanced dualities. Most graphically, it is integrated by
        its primary material, the contrastive complements of black and white,
        ink and paper, <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>, perturbed only at the margins
        by subtle deviations of media, and occasional encroachments of color.
        Architectural balance is sustained by the great double-helix of Chinese
        ink wash tradition, the distinct but inter-twined lineages of pictorial
        and calligraphic expression, image and sign, with each strand inciting
        the other into heightened flights of formal abstraction. Past and future
        – as already emphasized — are mutually suspended in a multiplied
        contemporaneity. Through all of this, Chinese art is re-balanced in the
        world, communicating with alternative cultural traditions at the
        abstract limit of each, where the escape from formal constraint fuses
        with the reality of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Abstract Ink” – as a culmination of tradition — is already
        distinctively Chinese, but the true cultural singularity that is pursued
        here exceeds the medium, to involve, minimally, a reciprocal creative
        irritation of painting and writing – twin twisted tracks that, between
        them, describe an aesthetic trajectory into abstraction. The Chinese
        tradition, propelled by this double training, cultivates resemblance and
        significance simultaneously, and thus, through relentless sublimation,
        flees both, into a horizon of purity where strokes and (gray-scale)
        tones become sheer flight, or indices of escape — cosmic gestures
        without substance or meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrayed along the northern end of the gallery, several series of small
        pieces by <b>Qiu Zhenzhong</b> undertake systematic experiments with
        stroke and tone. Calligraphic scripts are disentangled by cursive lines
        into unintelligible forms, or melted through tonal dissolves into the
        indefinite, whilst images are simplified to the brink of an archaic
        ideography.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Wang Tiande</b> – an artist of obvious centrality to the
        neotraditional renaissance – contributes two small pieces worked in his
        characteristic subtractive method — which combines stroke and tone in a
        piercing scorch – one tilted into his experimental practice from
        calligraphy, the other from painting. These pieces represent him (and
        testify to his importance), rather than demonstrating his work at its
        most fully or ambitiously achieved. Also included is a
        technically-complex textile work, in which the scorch method creates a
        calligraphically-annotated shirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Wei Ligang</b> is represented by a single, large, calligraphy-based
        work (<i>Unicorn-Crane</i>, 2010), whose golden, flowing background
        relaxes the show’s chromatic discipline. Color also creeps in through
        <b>Feng Mengbo</b>’s video work (<i>Not Too Late</i>, 2010), which makes
        the modernization of tradition both theme and medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Qiu Deshu</b>, a bold pioneer of neotraditional revival from the
        early 1980s, has two pieces on display (<i>Fissuring</i>, and
        <i>Fissuring Life</i>, 2012), more remarkable for their intelligence
        than their dazzling aesthetic presence. Abstract explorations of paper
        tearing and folding, they employ an intermediate ink tone to collapse
        shape onto the picture plane, bearing witness to a vanished spatial
        dimension.  (As with Wang Tiande, the casual encounter with Qiu Deshu in
        this show is best taken as an invitation to further engagement with a
        neotraditionalist artist of supreme importance.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For sheer visual drama, the calligraphic dimension of the exhibition is
        dominated by <b>Wang Dongling</b>. The three works on show (<i>Tiger Wind</i>, 2010; <i>Benevolence and
          Integrity</i>, 2013; and
        <i>Chuang-Tzu’s “Free and Easy Wandering”</i>, 2013) are not only
        striking (even stunning) in themselves, but also remarkable for their
        extraordinary variety. <i>Tiger Wind</i> is a large three-character
        cursive work whose bold sweeping lines – unmoderated by intermediate
        tones – compose a frozen leap of tensed energy.
        <i>Benevolence and Integrity</i> is a more architectural work,
        structured by soul-sucking slabs of abysmal blackness, whilst
        <i>Chuang-Tzu’s “Free and Easy Wandering” </i>is a more traditionally
        composed work, using serried Chinese script to playfully explore the
        combinatorial space of shape and shade. These outstanding pieces amply
        reward a visit to the exhibition on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three superb works by <b>Lan Zhenghui</b> and
        <b>Zheng Chongbin</b> complete the more painterly dimension of the show,
        displaying the potential of Ink Abstraction at a thrilling level of
        aesthetic achievement. Lan Zhenghui’s huge ‘mop’ work (<i>Leap Series No.4</i>, 2010) exuberantly jumbles
        ink-tones and stroke-angles to construct a
        monumental celebration of the medium as a vehicle for artistic liberty.
        Zheng Chongbin’s exquisite abstracts (<i>Untitled No.16</i>, 2007; and
        <i>Formless</i>, 2010), sharpening the tonal scale with vivid acrylics,
        conduct an utterly absorbing visual expedition into the limitless
        involvements of light and darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “These artists are part of a growing circle in China that draws
        inspiration from traditional Chinese ink painting and its philosophy as
        well as Chinese calligraphy,” the gallery explains. As the story of
        Chinese neotraditionalism takes shape, <strong></strong><i>B</i><i>eyond Black and White</i> will surely find a
        place among the
        tellers, as well as in the tale. It is also a feast for sense and
        thought alike. Catch it if you can.

    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Some time fragmentation is wholly predictable until Wednesday, in Ningbo
        (Zhejiang), due to an end of summer family break with berserk offspring.
        That was to have been compounded by computer crisis until the excellent
        IT guy at the hotel here sorted out what had seemed an insoluble
        connectivity problem. We’re at a beautiful Park Hyatt out at the edge of
        the town, done out in an aesthetic that mixes Jiangnan elements with the
        company’s cosmopolitan minimalism (rough textures, earth tones, and
        intricate landscaping seem to be consistent themes.) Our explorations of
        the city isn’t likely to amount to much, but there are a couple of cool
        things to report on over the  next couple of days. My expectation is
        something like the Hong Kong activity slump, but on heavy
        tranquillizers, so I’m throwing in a Chaos Patch to keep the wolves at
        the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1074"></span>ADDED (August 27): Besides the hotel itself,
        the main object of our neo-traditionalist excursion is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo_Museum">Ningbo Museum</a>,
        which won a Pritzker prize for architect Wang Shu last year. Wang was
        the architect behind Ningbo’s pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo
        (2010), a building I raved about at the time (in obscure places). His
        most distinctive design characteristic is monumental facades of brick
        and tile, recycled from demolished villages, and tessellated into
        endlessly absorbing surfaces, minimally punctuated by irregularly
        oriented and distributed windows. These walls look truly fantastic, each
        being an intricate composition, subtly incorporating drifts of texture
        and color from the non-uniform component elements. Exactly how the
        construction process works remains a mystery to me at this point, since
        it relies upon an astonishing degree of craft attention at the smallest
        scale of assembly — and therefore seems to make economies of
        standardization and scale impossible. In any case, somehow it’s done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second aspect of the Ningbo Museum is a hybrid structure, marrying
        the intricate recycled facades with colossal brutalist structures,
        consisting of comparatively homogeneous roughened concrete. The
        geometric language of massive angled planes comes straight off the
        Atlantic Wall 1944, and has an undeniable military-totalitarian edge.
        (Whatever one thinks about the alternative neo-traditionalist aesthetic
        expressed in our hotel, it doesn’t seem adamant about engaging in a
        conversation about death camps.)
      </p>
      <p>Conclusion? Not yet.</p>

        The Ningbo Museum, which won a Pritzker prize for architect Wang Shu
        last year, is a challenging edifice. Combining traditional elements and
        materials with monumental modernism — in its most uncompromisingly
        brutalist manifestation — it realizes a peculiar complex of delicacy and
        terror.<br />
        <img alt="NingboMuseum" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-90" height="211"

          " width="300" />Wang’s signature facades already display the same ambiguity in embryo.
        His vast sheer planes, shown in the Ningbo Tengtou pavilion at the 2010
        Shanghai World Expo (2010), memorialize a demolished past. The bricks
        and tiles from obliterated villages are recycled into exquisitely
        tessellated, endlessly absorbing surfaces, sparsely punctuated by
        irregularly oriented and distributed windows. The tension between
        crushing scale and intricate composition is immense (and intimate).
        Subtle drifts of texture and color from the non-uniform materials make
        the walls into sensual displays of abstract pattern, whilst their
        massive geometric rigor approaches a state of absolute menace (with
        <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NingboMuseum.jpg">an unmistakable
          military-totalitarian
          edge</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-93"></span>In the structure of the Ningbo Museum, this
        tension is compounded to an almost hysterical pitch by a hybrid
        structure, fusing the flattened village mosaics with colossal blocks of
        comparatively homogeneous textured concrete. The building looks like a
        modern fortress, assembled in an architectural language of hard
        defensive pragmatism. Every aperture is pressurized in the direction of
        a <em>slit</em>, as if even minimal openings were a reluctant concession
        to weakness and vulnerability. For the landmark cultural institution of
        an open, commercial city, nestled deep within China’s traditionally
        pacific Jiangnan region, this structural vocabulary is jarring, and
        indubitably provocative. If it has a message, it is not easy to decrypt.

        Shanghai’s the Power Station of Art is hosting <em>The Ninth Wave</em>,
        a solo
        <a href="http://www.powerstationofart.com/en/exhibition/detail/690kt.html">exhibition</a>
        of work by Cai Guo-Qiang (1957-), through to October 26. It’s …
        explosive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of the show, and its central exhibit, is taken from a painting
        (1850) by Russian artist Ivan Aivazavosky (1817-1900). This image of
        inundating disaster is of clear relevance to the show, but it also
        serves as a pretext and screen for an adoption of signs that Cai
        Guo-Qiang invests with singular (and cryptic) evocations. Deep rhythms
        of time, power, and number are a consistent theme flowing through the
        exhibition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The Ninth Wave</em> (2014) is a re-purposed boat, crowded with (99)
        stuffed animals. It was floated down the Huangpu to be installed in the
        show, making it the memorial of an event — a signature of Cai’s work.
        Superficially, it’s a Noah’s Ark, and an icon of ecological calamity,
        but this barnacled hulk, with its crew of traumatized inhuman survivors,
        also satirizes the dramatic narratives — whether comic or tragic — that
        are employed to frame the profound, ruinous tides of cosmic transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cai Guo-Qiang has seared his name on the cultural imagination in
        fireworks, pursuing an incendiary path to neotraditonalist aesthetic
        restoration. Working with gunpowder is the revival of a traditional
        Chinese artistic medium. Cai modernizes its potential for public
        spectacle, in ‘Explosive Events’ or ‘Pyrotechnic Explosion Projects’
        which are stunningly documented in the show. Yet, among the things Cai
        explodes is media compartmentalization. The fallout from his work
        includes char-marked images, production diagrams, and video recordings.
        His detonations spread across the entire multidimensional domain of
        visual aesthetics. Time itself is envisaged as a system of explosions,
        burns, and debris.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1017"></span><em>The Bund Without Us</em> (2014)
        epitomizes his usage of gunpowder as method for the production of static
        images. The process of creation is staged as an event, in which a
        complex, controlled explosion ‘draws’ the picture in gunpowder burns.
        The image is left as an aftermath. An enactment of devastation feeds
        naturally into a narrative of apocalyptic disappearance. (The title
        references an ecological catastrophe
        <a href="http://www.worldwithoutus.com/index2.html">fable</a>.)

        <em>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter</em> (2014) was created through an
        innovative re-combination of traditional media, depicting the cycle of
        the seasons in gunpowder-scorched porcelain. Rhythmic regularity emerges
        from a violent process of combustion, excavating a sublime order of
        recurrence from both nature and history.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Silent Ink</em> (2014) has ripped up a large gallery space to create
        an ink-filled pool, choked with multiple allusions, from the trite to
        the abysmal. Once again, a traditional medium is unpredictably
        modernized, pouring continuously into a colossal installation that
        evokes urban redevelopment, chemical pollution, and quotidian ravaging
        in general, while opening onto deeper cosmic themes of harsh time-cycles
        and spontaneous restorations. (The title, of course, echoes an
        environmentalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring">classic</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Head On</em> (2006) is a huge lupine loop, constructing a frozen
        dynamic in three dimensions. Ninety-nine wolves model social history as
        a cycle of collective leaps, crises, and dazed re-beginnings. (As in
        <em>The Ninth Wave</em>, with its 99 mammalian survivors, Cai escalates
        traditional Chinese numerology to figure a point of catastrophe and
        reversal.)

        Qin Shihuang’s terracotta funerary army hasn’t ever been high on the
        <em>UF</em> China attractions list. In Xi’an, there’s no choice but to
        see it though.

        The site is an extraordinary place. For a start, it is only very
        incompletely excavated — deliberately so — making the great halls a
        monument to the archaeological enterprise, almost as much as to the
        partially-exhumed exhibit itself. Qin Shihuang’s tomb is still
        undisturbed. It’s is beyond the capabilities of contemporary archaeology
        to deal with it, according to Chinese experts. Mercury saturation from
        moats of the alchemically-precious substance add a toxicity problem to
        the other technical difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worked-site (and exhibition area) is divided into three pits, of
        which the first is the hanger-scale structure shown here, in which the
        vast majority of the excavated warriors are displayed. Pit-2 presents
        the opportunity for a closer look at individual warriors. Pit-3
        dramatizes the archaeological effort with special intensity.

        The slogan “Dreams from the Qin Dynasty come true” might strike those of
        a more Confucian inclination with some misgivings, but it seems to have
        been selected as the condensation of the site’s official meaning. The
        non-uniformity of the model army, which is the main aesthetic point
        foregrounded, might perhaps be a hook for some ideological ambiguity.
        It’s not being presented as a fantasy of clone troopers, at least.

        Mohammad Salemy produces a
        <a href="http://supercommunity.e-flux.com/texts/art-after-the-machines/">manifesto</a>
        for the deepening machine age. “What makes this experiment necessary is
        the severity of the cultural crisis in which art stubbornly refuses to
        find itself.”
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Manifesto’ is a <em>UF</em> categorization, that responds to the text’s
        dominant imperative tone, as exemplified by: “Art needs to be removed
        from its contemporary ivory tower to deal with the implications of its
        appearance, but unlike twentieth-century modernisms, today art cannot
        afford to be solely about the limitations of its supporting material, or
        only conceived in relation to its own history and ontology.”
      </p>
      <p>Much, too, though for awkward contemplative nihilists:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Art, whether artists agree or not, is the void of meaning folded in
          cognitive wrapping paper, visible only as the surface of cognition and
          as the materialization of both the historical and semantic emptiness
          which it carries. It is a series of verifiable claims inserted into
          the real world and reified to take up the empty space of meaning, a
          void occupying another void.</em>

        One of the many reasons to be suspicious about political activism on the
        Occidental off-spectrum right is the parochialism that feeds it. There
        is a global process that will settle what occurs in its broad structure,
        making local pretensions to decisive ideological agency simply
        ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental economic outcome — and thus the fate of the world — is
        not ultimately controllable even by the central financial
        administrations of the major world powers (unless certain intriguing
        axioms of radical contemporary fascism are defensible), so the idea that
        extremely marginalized Western cabals are positioned to seize the
        political driving seat is so saturated in self-deception that it wastes
        everybody’s time. In addition, technological developments complicate all
        economic forecasts essentially, and obscurely. We cannot even
        approximately delimit what unforeseen technical breakthroughs could
        entail.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-594"></span>The geopolitical context is even clearer. The
        collapse of Islam, and rise of China, are re-organizations of the world
        so evident in their unfolding, so vast in their implication, and so
        inadequately thought, that they make a mockery of all political programs
        yet conceived. It is first necessary to know, if only in roughest
        outline, what is taking place in profundity — tidally, and inexorably —
        before determining an ideologically relevant act. The process comes
        first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Already in Moldbug, and increasingly elsewhere, there are signs within
        some of the most thoughtful regions of the Occidental ‘reactosphere’
        that could be interpreted as a pre-adaptation to an impending Chinese
        global hegemony (complementary to the decline of the West). The most
        recent is
        <a href="http://bannerofcosmos.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/on-the-design-of-the-antiversity/">here</a>. When we
        entertain speculations about the nature of ‘our’ envisaged
        reaction, it cannot be realistically disentangled from what the world
        will have become. (I’ve been dismissive of Moldbug’s “Call me Mencius”
        line in the past, not — I hope — vindictively, but out of the
        anticipation that we will increasingly be talking about the original
        Mencius, and the potential for confusion is already visible.)
      </p>
      <p>
        From the (cultivated) Chinese perspective, the structure of world
        history is not defined through modes of Abrahamic eschatology, but with
        respect to deep rhythms of Confucian Restoration, describing a spiral,
        in which advance and return are synthesized. If the hypothesis of a
        continuing trend to a more Chinese world is — at least momentarily —
        granted credibility, then the present (second) epoch of Confucian
        Restoration is the key to historical intelligibility on a global scale.

      <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mou_Zongsan">Mou Zongsan</a> could
        prove more important to us than any Western political theorist writing
        today. The restoration he conceives has the remarkable advantage of
        <em>already taking place</em>. He does not have to imagine what ‘would
        be nice’, and because he doesn’t, neither do we. Instead, we can explore
        what is in fact happening, even if from an angle that remains
        unfamiliar. An alternative order need not be extracted from the rot and
        ruin of the old.

        The new <em>Urban Future</em> site should be going up in the next few
        days, re-focused by a division of labor with this blog. The dark thrills
        of collapse will still dominate here, but UF2 will devote itself to the
        lineaments of a restored civilization and a renewed modernity which are
        — from the perspective of Shanghai — much closer to ‘home’. When the
        threshold is passed, of course, I’ll invite you all over. It won’t be so
        rough over there, so please take your shoes off at the door.

        Jason Clower has edited an indispensable volume of Mou Zongsan’s
        writings (<em>Late Works of Mou Zongsan: Selected Essays in Chinese Philosophy</em>, forthcoming). In the first
        words of his introduction, he says: “If
        twentieth-century China produced a philosopher of the first rank, it was
        Mou Zongsan.” This judgment strikes me as near-irresistible. A taste
        (from two of the first three essays):

      <p>
        From <b>Objective Understanding and the Remaking of Chinese Culture</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>…to adapt to the times you have to understand the times. For that you
          need right knowledge of the present age (<strong>xiandai</strong>
          現代) … Compared to political and social activities, the influence of
          scholarly culture is an influence on a virtual level (<strong>xuceng</strong>
          虛層), but “the virtual governs the solid” (<strong>xu yi kong shi </strong>虛以控實) and its influence is wide and
          far-reaching, which is why I
          call it a “decisive influence.” We should not take it lightly and
          think that it is not an urgent matter.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>… to have objective understanding. The first step is to understand
          ourselves; the second step is to understand the West. Then we can look
          for the way out for Chinese culture, and we hope that our young
          friends will take on this responsibility. In its simple essentials,
          this responsibility is to revive the ancient meaning of Greek
          philosophy. Its original meaning was what Kant defined as a “doctrine
          of practical wisdom” (<strong>shijian de zhihuixue </strong>實踐的智慧學). And what is wisdom? Only “yearning after
          the highest
          good” is wisdom. As most people know, philosophy is the “love of
          wisdom,” and the “love” in question is the kind of love that is
          “heartfelt yearning for that highest good in human life and constantly
          wanting to put it into practice.” That is why Kant called “philosophy”
          in its ancient Greek sense a “doctrine of practical wisdom.” The term
          is very apt. But this ancient meaning of philosophy has already been
          lost in the West. Nowadays all that is left is linguistic analysis
          under the conditions of advanced civilization, with logic having been
          reduced to applied computing. This does not actually count as
          philosophy, only the degeneration of philosophy into a technology. To
          enter into the depths of philosophy, it has to be that “love of
          wisdom,” the “yearning after the highest good.” But though the West
          has forgotten it, this sense of philosophy has been preserved in the
          Chinese tradition, as what the Chinese ancients called “teachings”
          (<strong>jiao </strong>教). Buddhism exemplifies the meaning of
          “teachings” most clearly, but Confucianism has it too, as the
          “teaching” referred to in the Doctrine of the Mean when it says, “The
          understanding that arises from authenticity is called our nature, and
          the authenticity that arises from understanding is called teaching,”
          and when it says, “What heaven decrees is called our nature; following
          our nature is called the Way; cultivating the Way is called
          teaching.”  The meaning of “teaching” here is not institutional
          education as currently practiced, which takes knowledge as its
          standard. Rather, it is “philosophy,” the “yearning after the highest
          good” of a doctrine of practical wisdom.</em>

        <em>Nowadays in the West, Anglo-American analytic philosophy is in
          command, and the most famous on the European continent are Heidegger’s
          existential philosophy and Husserl’s phenomenology, the “dainty
          philosophies” (<strong>xianqiao zhexue </strong>纖巧哲學) of the
          twentieth century, uninformed by the great Way of the
          <del>gentleman</del> superior man. Only that which connects upwardly
          (<strong>shangtong</strong> 上通) with noumenon or being-in-itself
          (<strong>benti </strong>本體) counts as informed by the great Way of
          the <del>gentleman</del> superior man, whereas those two men do not
          have an idea of noumenon. So as far as I am concerned, Husserl’s
          phenomenology, though written so tortuously and with such show, is at
          bottom impoverished to the point of having no content at all. For it
          has lost the wisdom of method and given up philosophy’s
          stock-in-trade, so that all that is left for it is to say empty words.
          All those questions of theirs can just be consigned to science; what
          need is there for philosophy to be its cheerleader? So nowadays, we
          cannot rely on the West for real philosophy; we have to come back to
          ourselves and understand Chinese philosophy. My life’s work has been
          very simple, it has been preliminary objective understanding, but it
          has already surpassed previous ages. Thus I once wrote a letter to a
          student of mine on the mainland saying that my life has been very
          ordinary, and the only exceptional thing is that very few people
          nowadays can surpass me in objective understanding. I have no
          prejudices. I have even read some of Marx’s <strong>Capital</strong>,
          and have done so with an open mind. I am not even a complete stranger
          to economics; it is simply not my specialty. So my disgust for Marx is
          not a bias but a true inability to appreciate him even after I had
          understood him.</em>

        <em>… I believe that for the work of absorbing Western culture, the best
          medium is Kant. … I am not a Kant expert but I do believe that I have
          a relatively good understanding of Kant. To understand Kant one must
          first understand his original meaning. There are more people who teach
          about his first Critique and people know a bit more about this one.
          There are fewer who teach about his second Critique and people know a
          bit less about it. As for the third, no one teaches about it and no
          one understands it. I have been translating it and at the same time
          working hard to understand it and understand Kant’s original meaning,
          in order to be able then to digest it. In my view, Kant really is
          talking about problems and wants to solve some problems, but to see
          his limits in solving those problems, the only way is with traditional
          Chinese philosophical wisdom. Chinese wisdom can take Kant even
          farther. If Kant experts only read Kant and Westerners only read
          Western philosophy, they will not necessarily understand Kant’s
          original meaning. Among British and American translators of Kant, each
          of the Critiques has three people who have translated it but no one
          person has translated all three. They are expert in just one aspect of
          Kant and so do not necessarily understand Kant. I am not an expert,
          for my foundation is Chinese philosophy, and therefore I can discern
          Kant’s original meaning and take him a step further.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Why do I say that Kant is the best medium for reminting Chinese
          philosophy? I often say that “one mind with two gates” is a shared
          philosophical model. From ancient times the West has recognized the
          two gates, as Kant did, but nowadays Western philosophy is only left
          with one gate, and this amounts to a shrinkage in philosophy. In the
          West, the noumenal aspect of the one mind with two gates has not been
          developed well. It did receive a little of the attention due it from
          Kant, but it was negative, and Wittgenstein’s
          <strong>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</strong> continued Kant’s
          negative approach, so that all was left were a few ripples. …
          Wittgenstein’s point was that anything belonging to the world of
          value, of the good and the beautiful, is mysterious and unsayable, and
          that whereof one cannot speak, one must remain silent. This sort of
          attitude is as negative as it is possible to be, and in keeping with
          this, on the European Continent, Heidegger and Husserl did not touch
          noumenon at all. The two gates are the original meaning of philosophy,
          but now all that is left is the one gate of phenomena. Chinese
          philosophy happens to be just the opposite. It is best at noumenon but
          not good at phenomena. That is also the real reason that China wants
          modernization.

        <em>If you can deeply understand the significance of “one mind with two
          gates,” then you will understand that the more advanced civilization
          is, the greater the need for a “doctrine of practical wisdom” and for
          what in China has been called “teaching” to firm up the course of our
          life and right the problems that come with advanced civilization.
          Therefore Westerners should also look to China for instruction and not
          just expect Chinese people to come seek instruction from them. But
          Westerners are able not to respect Chinese because Chinese do not read
          their own books and hence have no instruction to offer.</em>

        From <strong>M</strong><b>eeting at Goose Lake</b>
        <strong>– The Great Synthesis in the Development of Chinese Culture and the
          Merging of Chinese and Western Tradition</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We commonly say that Song-Ming Confucianism was skewed in the
          direction of inner sagehood. By the end of the Ming, in the sixteenth
          and seventeenth centuries when Wang Fuzhi, Huang Zongxi, and Gu Yanwu
          appeared,  they already knew that Chinese history was about to turn in
          a new direction, that they could not continue in the direction that
          Song-Ming Confucians had been going for six hundred years, because it
          placed too much weight on inner sagehood.  Thus people like Huang,
          Wang, and Gu began advocating openness to external things, expanding
          from inner sagehood to outer kingship as well, and thus it was that
          they began to emphasize the pragmatic study of statecraft (<strong>jingshi zhiyong zhi xue</strong>
          經世致用之學). But the reason that this development from inner
          sagehood to outer kingship was interrupted and did not bear fruit was
          the Manchu Qing dynasty. The arrival of the Manchus meant that China
          was ruled by an alien race …</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The three hundred years of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and
          nineteenth centuries comprised the Manchus’ Qing empire, and the Qing
          empire brought not even a scintilla of benefit to Chinese culture.
          That is China’s recent history. How could China’s original history and
          culture produce the Communist Party? It was the shallow
          intellectualism of the May Fourth movement. Why was the movement so
          shallow? Because of the baleful influence of mid-Qing textual studies.
          As its influence spread gradually, Chinese intellectuals lost the
          ability to think and to carry on with the development of thought. And
          because of those three hundred years of Qing rule and the
          intellectuals’ loss of the capacity to think, the historical
          opportunity was lost and the movement toward and demand for a
          development from inner sagehood to outer kingship was repressed. If
          there had been no three hundred years of Manchu rule, the natural
          course of the Chinese nation’s development would have been little
          different than the West’s. It was exactly during the seventeenth,
          eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries of the Qing that the West
          progressed quickly toward modernization. … Of itself, the cultural
          life-force of the Chinese nation was poised to open outward. It was
          only that it was repressed by the Manchus.</em>

          to take up the responsibility of that necessity.</em>

          own culture which will be the basis and which will merge with the
          Western tradition of the Greeks. Western science and philosophy comes
          from the Greeks. Modern liberal democracy has many components, with
          contributions from Greek tradition, from Roman tradition, and from the
          modern Industrial Revolution and the English Magna Carta. Western
          liberal democracy is also a modern product, coming in the last three
          hundred years, rather than something that existed from the beginning.
          And in the Western tradition, apart from Greece and Rome, there is
          also the Hebrew tradition, which is religious (Christian). These are
          the contours of Western culture.</em>

          developed by the West out of various causal conditions, but we do not
          want a great synthesis with Christianity. The relationship with
          Christianity is not a matter of synthesis but of “classifying the
          teachings.” We do not oppose Christianity. Western people’s faith and
          prayer is fine; that is their way, though it is not ours. But we can
          critically examine teachings, as Buddhists of the past did. We can
          distinguish what is the same and different in them, what is high or
          low, and what is perfect or imperfect.</em>

        <em>What is a “true mind-only theory?” There is nothing wrong with using
          the phrase “mind-only theory,” but within Western philosophy there is
          no mind-only theory, only idealism. This has to be clarified. Neither
          Plato’s idealism nor Kant’s idealism nor Berkeley’s idealism can be
          regarded as a mind-only theory. Idealism is not mind, so Western
          philosophy only has idealism, not a mind-only theory. What the
          Communists call “mind-only” or “idealism” is for them just an
          indiscriminate term of opprobrium. They use “idealist” and
          “materialist” as value labels, but they are clueless about Western
          idealism. Idealism is about ideas, but an idea itself is not mind.
          Plato’s idealism is a theory of Forms. Kant’s is a transcendental
          idealism (<strong>chaoyue de linianlun</strong> 超越的理念論). What
          are these ideas? For Kant, they are concepts of reason, which are
          different from concepts of the understanding. Concepts of the
          understanding are categories, which are the conditions for
          accomplishing knowledge, whereas concepts of reason cannot represent
          knowledge. Therefore, Kant’s thought can only be called a
          transcendental idealism. For Berkeley, an idea is a perceived
          phenomenon, not a mind but an object of mind, a particular, real
          object. Berkeley’s saying, that “to be is to be perceived” [<strong>esse est percipi</strong>] [means that his
          so-called subjective idealism] is a subjective
          percept theory (<strong>zhuguan de juexianglun</strong> 主觀的覺象論).
          It is completely wrong to translate it as a “subjective idealism”
          (<strong>zhuguan de guannian lun</strong> 主觀的觀念論) or “subjective
          mind-only theory” (<strong>zhuguan de weixin lun </strong>主觀的唯心論). In the West, ideas are always regarded as
          objects, and
          though objects are related to the mind, in particular to the cognitive
          mind, nonetheless they are not themselves the mind. Therefore only
          China has true mind-only philosophy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>Where philosophical systems are concerned, we would do best to use
          Kant’s philosophy as our bridge. Kant is the best go-between for
          absorbing Western culture to remint Chinese philosophy and support
          Chinese doctrines. Kant’s framework opens up two realms, the realm of
          phenomena and the realm of noumena (<strong>benti</strong> 本體) or,
          if we superimpose Buddhist terminology on it, it is “one mind opening
          through two doors.” In the West, the noumenal dimension has not been
          developed well. In Kant’s system, noumena has only a negative meaning. </em>[…]<em>
          Applied to Kant’s philosophy, “one mind with two gates” refers to
          phenomena and noumena. But it must be understood in Chinese terms,
          through the mainline cultural spirit of the three Eastern teachings of
          Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Trying to understand the “one mind
          with two gates” by means of Kant’s system does not work; it must be
          through the Chinese tradition. This is why I say that if you want to
          get a handle on what China has been doing for thousands of years, you
          must delve deeply into the mainline of its cultural life. Thoroughly
          immersing yourself is the only way to understand its strengths;
          otherwise “cultural life” is just an empty phrase.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>First we thoroughly understand China’s mind-only system, and then
          based on the wisdom of that system, we digest Kant. For Kant’s cannot
          be called a true mind-only theory, only a transcendental idealism,
          which implies that it is negative. What is positive in Kant is his
          empirical realism, which is limited to the phenomenal world, the
          empirical world. Concerning this, please see my book
          <strong>Phenomenon and Thing-in-Itself</strong>. The thing for us to
          do, then, is to take Kant’s transcendental idealism and his empirical
          realism and, building on Chinese wisdom, turn it into a two-tiered
          ontology, of “attached ontology” and “non-attached ontology.” 
          “Attached ontology” is that of the cognitive mind (<strong>shixin</strong>
          識心). A “non-attached ontology” is that of the wisdom mind (<strong>zhixin</strong>
          智心), and it is this which is a true mind-only theory. Mind-only
          theory emerges from “non-attached ontology,” and it is something that
          cannot come out of Western philosophy. The mind-only theory that
          emerges from non-attached ontology can also be called thorough-going
          realism (<strong>shizai lun</strong> 實在論).<br />

        [If you can see why this line of thinking makes Mou Zongsan — despite
        his very different topical concerns — a Chinese Mises (at the level of
        abstract metaphysics), you’ve earned a patronizing
        <em>Outside in</em> pat on the head.]

    </a>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        After a difficult half millennium, China’s place in the world is
        adjusting back towards its longer term norm, at a speed that continues
        to disconcert even the most diligent observers. With this positive
        correction comes an inevitable ‘spirit’ of revival, extending from the
        level of unreflective mood, through partially articulate attitudes, to
        the loftiest peaks of systematic cultural restoration. As this wave of
        revitalization intensifies, and refines itself, it becomes increasingly
        involved in a re-thinking of Confucianism and its historical meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The philosopher most indispensable to this process is Mou Zongsan
        (1909-1995), the most brilliant of China’s New Confucians, setting the
        standards of intellectual rigor and audacity for the country’s
        third-wave of Confucian inspiration, following those of the Pre-Qin and
        Song-Ming periods. Describing the Confucian tradition as the “main
        artery” of Chinese culture, responsible not only for its own
        perpetuation and renewal, but also for the safe-keeping of the country’s
        Daoist and Buddhist traditions, Mou considered its renaissance a
        “necessity”. It not only should, but would return, assuming only that
        Chinese culture has a future. It is due to this indestructible
        confidence that Mou’s own name is inextricably bound to the wider
        prospects of Chinese national recovery.

      </p>
      <p>
        Mou
        <a href="http://nineteenlectures.wordpress.com/tag/mou-zongsan/">recognizes</a>
        that the Confucian tradition is more than an arbitrary ethnic
        peculiarity, to be retained out of some extrinsic commitment to cultural
        preservation. Rather, the task of cultural restoration is inherent to
        it, as a core feature, from the time of Confucius:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How did Confucius view the Zhou culture? His attitude was positive,
          ritual being always necessary. Whatever the period, a society will
          always need ritual. Confucius believed that the rituals instituted by
          the Duke of Zhou were in his time still useful. Of course they could
          be contracted or expanded with prudence but you ought not to radically
          overturn them. So his attitude was positive. However, it was through
          his re-vitalization of the Zhou rites that he came to develop what is
          called Confucian thought. For it was not that the Zhou rituals were
          without objective validity because of intrinsic flaws, but rather that
          they had lost effectiveness because the nobles were corrupt and
          degenerate and unable to carry the weight of the ritual and music.
          Corruption undermined their ability to uphold these rituals, and if
          they could not practice them, would not the Zhou rituals then become
          empty? Because they became empty, they became mere form, became
          so-called formalism. The Mohists and Daoists looked upon them as mere
          form and thus wanted to negate them. Confucius knew that the
          corruption of the nobility made the Zhou ritual empty, but he wanted
          to re-vitalize it. The Confucian attitude was that to make the Zhou
          ritual valid, it had to be first revivified.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Confucianism has undoubtedly undergone periods of victimization, but it
        cannot afford to retreat into victimage, because it has inalienable
        responsibility not only for its own restoration, but for Chinese
        cultural restoration in general. This argument can be extended still
        further, since Mou contends that even Western philosophy depends
        (unknowingly) upon the revitalization of China’s Confucian tradition for
        the re-awakening of its ultimate possibilities — as epitomized by the
        undeveloped potential of the Kantian system, to supply a practical path
        into the cryptic realms of the <em>noumenon </em>(following the thread
        of ‘intellectual intuition’). The world-historical destiny of
        philosophy, and the self-restoration of Confucianism, were conceived by
        Mou as a single cultural necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Urban Future</em> has no doubt that over the course of proceeding
        decades Mou Zongsan’s international reputation will be immensely
        enhanced, as he is recognized — in Jason Clower’s words — as “a
        philosopher of the first rank” with the intellectual stature of a
        Heidegger or Wittgenstein. It is thrilling to witness such a figure at
        the stage of early ascent, extracted from relative obscurity and
        projected into global consciousness as a cultural treasure of
        inestimable value.
      </p>
      <p>
        For English readers, Clower’s contribution to the discovery of Mou
        Zongsan deserves special mention. He has already released a

        on Mou and Buddhism, with an edited collection of Mou’s writings
        forthcoming (<em>Late Works of Mou Zongsan: Selected Essays in Chinese Philosophy</em>). As China’s cultural
        restoration unfolds, and Mou’s star rises, these
        volumes will eventually find their way onto a million bookshelves, as
        invaluable guides to a new world, and an old one.

      <h4 class="post-title">Exploration of the Outside</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Mou Zongsan opens a gate into the Chinese cultural interior by
        unswervingly directing his work at its most radically indigenous
        characteristics, uncompromised by ulterior elements, and therefore
        undistracted by any seductions of otherness or exoticism that fall short
        of its inherent destination — connection with the absolute Outside. That
        alone is authentically Chinese, Mou insists, which originates and
        culminates in the Way (道), cultivating an unsegregated mutual
        involvement of thought and being which corresponds closely to the
        Occidental philosophical concept of <em>intellectual intuition</em>.
        Whether approached through the Daoist, Buddhist, or Confucian strains of
        the Chinese cultural complex, the consistent ethnic characteristic is an
        interior path to exterior reality, continuous with the way of ‘heaven’
        (天), or cosmic necessity. The inner voyage is the way out, but more
        importantly — for the Confucian current at least — it is the way to let
        the Outside in, making culture a conduit for the cultivation of the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Mou Zongsan’s summit of philosophical intensity, therefore, no true
        boundary can be drawn between a project marked by extreme cultural
        ‘nationalism’ and an ontologically-grounded cosmopolitanism, or between
        a diligent restoration of
        <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/cultural-restoration-and-mou-zongsan/">tradition</a>
        and a venture beyond the horizon of time. The inward path reaches out
        (as it fuses with the tendrils of Outsideness, which reach in).
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-139"></span>In his essay on the
        <b>Meeting at Goose Lake</b>, Mou seeks to explain the singularity of
        the Chinese tradition in terms intelligible to Western philosophy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… Kant attached only a negative meaning to noumena. Applied to Kant’s
          philosophy, “one mind with two gates” refers to phenomena and noumena.
          But it must be understood in Chinese terms, through the mainline
          cultural spirit of the three Eastern teachings of Confucianism,
          Buddhism, and Daoism. Trying to understand the “one mind with two
          gates” by means of Kant’s system does not work; it must be through the
          Chinese tradition. This is why I say that if you want to get a handle
          on what China has been doing for thousands of years, you must delve
          deeply into the mainline of its cultural life. Thoroughly immersing
          yourself is the only way to understand its strengths; otherwise
          “cultural life” is just an empty phrase.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Metaphysical traditionalism attains extroversion through introversion,
        so that its “perfect teaching” is announced as a culmination of paradox.
        It is only at the limit of psychological and cultural inwardness that
        the gate of deep connection is opened, enabling cultural encounters in
        profundity, rather than a confusion of comparisons, facile commonalities
        and contrasts. Chinese and Western philosophy meet at the summit, and
        through the Outside, whose brink each discovers on its own distinctive
        path.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paradoxical signs of the ‘perfect teaching’ guide Mou’s restoration
        of Chinese intellectual tradition, as it homes — or strays — to the root
        of acceptance <em>and</em> correction. In order
        <em>to turn Confucianism into itself</em>, he cultivates (discovers /
        invents) a third strand of orthodoxy upon which to train the luxuriant
        but disordered growth of Cheng-Zhu <em>lixue</em> and Lu-Wang
        <em>xinxue</em>: a lineage passing through the comparatively obscure
        figures of Hu Wufeng (or Hu Hong) and Liu Jishan (or Liu Zongzhou). It
        is this third thread of the tradition, he contends, that most fully
        develops the essential intellectual content of Confucianism, making it
        the true inheritor of the Northern Song <em>ruxue</em> legacy (Zhou
        Dunyi, Zhang Zai, and Cheng Mingda), which is itself the uncontested
        conveyor of the ancient canon. It alone consistently refuses the
        delusive separation of intelligence from the Way, and thus preserves the
        understanding of human conduct as cosmic self-realization. Within the
        (correctable) Lu-Wang line, this insight tends to slide into eclipse,
        but on the mainstream Cheng-Zhu line the slippage has become an
        assertive deviation — hardened into “fundamental error”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mou’s metaphysical traditionalism coaxes Chinese intellectual history
        into an <em>immanent correction</em>, through which its proper
        inwardness is reinforced as a resilient — or fusional — connection to
        the Outside. What is most its own is spiral immersion within the Way,
        where the second gate opens.

        Every great philosopher has a single thought, Martin Heidegger asserted.
        However questionable this claim might be, it applies without
        qualification to Mou Zongsan, China’s greatest modern philosopher (and
        perhaps also the world’s).
      </p>
      <p>
        While the breadth of Mou’s scholarship is intimidating, it was made
        possible only by conformity to a methodical life-long study schedule,
        organized by a single idea. His <em>one thought</em>, which he
        translated into the language of Western Philosophy as ‘intellectual
        intuition’ (<em>νοῦς</em>, <em>intellektuelle Anschauung</em>),
        integrates not only his own thinking, but also — he consistently
        maintains — the entire Chinese philosophical tradition, of which it is
        the cap-stone, or guiding thread. Each of China’s three teachings
        (三教), Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist, tends to a principle of
        intellectual intuition in which it finds consummation as a “perfect
        teaching” and through which it adheres by inner necessity (rather than
        extrinsic cultural and historical accident) to the integral Chinese
        canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-180"></span>If any single concept has a density of
        significance sufficient to define the essence of a vast and
        highly-ramified world culture, it can be expected to resist casual
        comprehension. To understand it, as Mou painstakingly demonstrates, is
        not a preparatory step to thinking within the tradition, but the
        ultimate cultural task posed by the tradition, in each of its main
        constitutive strands. If Chinese culture shares an initiatory insight,
        it is not a readily concluded <em>realization</em>, but an integrative
        <em>aspiration</em>, which orients its various parts towards the same
        destination, or final achievement. Cognitive resolution is subordinated
        to practical development, through self-cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the West, intellectual intuition is notoriously a
        <em>difficult</em> concept, to such an extent that it is widely
        dismissed as an example of philosophical extravagance, beyond all
        possibility of rigorous formulation, or theoretical use. Designating the
        direct self-apprehension of intelligence, it was associated from the
        earliest times with the process of divine mind. Aristotle’s God, whose
        self-contemplative thought is the turning of the highest action upon the
        highest object, epitomized the notion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kant determined intellectual intuition to lie beyond any possible human
        understanding, strictly exiling it to the outer sphere of divine
        intelligences. Henceforth, appeals to the concept would be the mark of
        romantic or ‘mystical’ philosophical undertakings (represented primarily
        by the thinkers of German ‘Objective Idealism’ and those influenced by
        them). As techno-scientific rationality incrementally supplanted
        speculative metaphysics, and divinities shriveled to implausible
        hypotheses, the significance of intellectual intuition contracted
        towards a vanishing point — whether discreditable eccentricity, or
        historical curiosity. In Mou Zongsan’s terms, Western philosophy, in
        keeping with its own cultural fatality, had become almost perfectly
        non-Chinese.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence">Great Divergence</a>‘ familiar from discussions of
        world economic history, therefore, had a
        rigorously-determinable high-cultural counterpart, which explains why,
        when East and West experienced their hard encounter within modernity,
        they would be bound together through profound mutual estrangement. The
        idea identified by Mou Zongsan as the basic principle of Oriental
        Intelligence, through which — alone — Chinese culture makes sense, had
        been shelved by the Occident centuries before, as an oddity of
        speculative theology, and now lay buried in dust, barely recollected,
        let alone even tentatively understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the idea of directly self-apprehending intelligence were to remain
        the preserve of 19th century German metaphysics, it is scarcely
        imaginable that the gulf between East and West — as Mou Zongsan
        understands it — could ever be more than tenuously bridged. Either the
        East would remain entirely inscrutable to all West, excepting only a
        cultural fringe of Orientalists, devoted to the pursuit of radical
        exoticism, or the East would depart fundamentally from its own cultural
        path, Westernizing itself until commensurable thinking was reached. Both
        of these prospects were explicitly deplored in the influential

        “A Manifesto for a Re-appraisal of Sinology and Reconstruction of
        Chinese Culture” (为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言), signed by Mou Zongsan and
        three other ‘New Confucian’ students of Xiong Shili (Zhang Junmai, Tang
        Junyi, and Xu Fuguan), originally published in 1958.

        That the tide of the economic and geostrategic Great Divergence turned
        in the final decades of the last century is a matter of indisputable
        fact, confirmed by a deluge of quantitative performance indicators. The
        cultural aspect of this reversal is necessarily more complicated, and
        contentious. In the West, there are no doubt very many who would account
        for the transition in terms of Chinese Westernization, beginning with
        the adoption of European ‘scientific socialism’ in the late 1940s, and
        maturing through liberalization — or economic-technological
        globalization — until reaching the

        A very different narrative, and one in which the emerging status of Mou
        Zongsan could be far more positively limned — would adhere tightly to
        the problem of intellectual intuition, or self-apprehending
        intelligence. The most significant reference would be I J Good, and his
        path-breaking

        ‘Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine’, composed
        in the early 1960s and first published in 1965. In this paper, Good
        writes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far
          surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.
          Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities,
          an ultra-intelligent machine could design even better machines; there
          would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the
          intelligence of man would be left far behind … Thus the first
          ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever
          make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to
          keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom
          outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science
          fiction seriously.</em>

        The techno-scientific horizon is described by a reflexive intelligence,
        practically apprehending itself, and in doing so marking the final human
        purpose. This is quite evidently ‘intellectual intuition’ as it emerges
        at the outer-edge of modernity, rather than among the jumbled
        curiosities of its philosophical ancestry. If it corresponds to the
        Chinese cultural core — as Mou Zongsan doggedly maintains — it is as an
        anticipated destination, rather than an abandoned legacy. Advanced
        modernization heads <em>towards it</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While, superficially, the tale of Chinese modernity might be construed
        as the replacement of Confucius by robotics, careful attention to the
        problem of intellectual intuition suggests something very different.
        Self-cultivation <em>or</em> self-improving intelligence — what sort of
        choice is that?
