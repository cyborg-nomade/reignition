        The entire review (for
        <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, one star), by ‘Amazon Customer’ and entitled:
        <em><strong>Stick to Stephenie Meyer, for heaven’s sake!</strong></em> —
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My 15-year-old daughter Tricia is a great fan of vampire fiction, and
          I bought this for her from a remaindered book stall, thinking it would
          be just up her street. The rather childish daub on the cover did make
          me think that perhaps the book would be too young for her, but seeing
          as it was priced at 40p I reckoned I could not go too far wrong.</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>This is possibly the worst mistake I have ever made.</p>
        <p>
          From being a happy-go-lucky Goth with a crush on Robert Pattinson,
          Tricia has become a ‘post-human nihilist’ who stays up all night
          listening to the sort of machine music that makes your ears bleed and
          gibbering about the ‘Dark Enlightenment’.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have written to the book’s author to complain, but received no
          reply. I am informed by his publishers that Mr Land has in any case
          disowned all his previous writing and decamped to Shanghai.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>None too soon, in my view – but too late for Tricia, I fear.</em>

          ‘Xeno’ obviously means from without; alien. Nick Land, author of
          Xenosystems, frequently compares capitalism to a kind of impersonal
          superintelligent force, a bit like some Lovecraftian intelligence
          stretching back from the future to manipulate petty humans en mass.
          And he longs for the antihuman genocide these intelligences, once
          ‘taken off’, will inflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might sound crazy, but this is the clear landscape of his inner
          thought, if you go through the posts and study them. He constantly
          references Lovecraftian gods (think about it: Xenos, aliens,
          Xenosystems, alien-systems) and sometimes his attempts to darkly
          invoke them. He’s also into Kaballah and Eugenics. And he wants his
          cold lovecraftian capitalism to take root in some ‘exit’ nation like
          Singapore and implement a eugenic program under the guidance of a
          capitalistic-monarchical elite.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be clear to you by now that he’s an early-stage NWO stooge
          to get a movement of people begging for their own enslavement going.
          He is an ex-Marxist primarily inspired by a malignant Jew. He thinks
          he’s a super-clever occultist with his games and finds it funny
          laughing at all of you fools who think he actually cares about
          degeneracy and all the wrongs this big mean society has done to your
          little plebian selves.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>If you knew Spengler, you’d be able to predict this. Winter phase. If
          you knew history, you’d be able to predict this: Jesuits being
          jesuitical, plebs being plebian. Agents causing, and the masses being
          cut up, re-crafted, and stuffed into new, tighter boxes.</em>

      <p>Does anybody else out there expect the NWO to be this cool?</p>

        Galen’s theory that the sexual organs were related by analogy, converted

    <section class="post">
      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/antechamber-to-horror/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Antechamber to Horror</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        I’ve been planning an expedition into horror, for which the Kurtz of
        Conrad and of Coppola is an essential way-station – perhaps even a
        terminus. The mission is to articulate horror as a functional, cognitive
        ‘achievement’ – a calm catastrophe of all intellectual inhibition —
        tending to realism in its ultimate possibility. Horror is the true end
        of philosophy. So it counted as a moment of synchronicity to stumble
        upon Richard Fernandez
        <a href="http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/08/10/callback/#more-30806">quoting</a>
        (Coppola’s) Kurtz — and it had to be passed along immediately. There is,
        of course, only one passage that matters, so it is no coincidence that
        Fernandez selects it:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I’ve seen horrors… horrors that you’ve
          seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to
          kill me. You have a right to do that… but you have no right to judge
          me. It’s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those
          who do not know what horror means. Horror… Horror has a face… and you
          must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your
          friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are
          truly enemies! I remember when I was with Special Forces… seems a
          thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some
          children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for
          polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He
          couldn’t see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off
          every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little
          arms. And I remember… I… I… I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I
          wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn’t know what I wanted to do! And I
          want to remember it. I never want to forget it… I never want to
          forget. And then I realized… like I was shot… like I was shot with a
          diamond… a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, my
          God… the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect,
          genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were
          stronger than we, because they could stand that […] these were not
          monsters, these were men… trained cadres. These men who fought with
          their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with
          love… but they had the strength… the strength… to do that. If I had
          ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very
          quickly. You have to have men who are moral… and at the same time who
          are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without
          feeling… without passion… without judgment… without judgment! Because
          it’s judgment that defeats us.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To pluck out one sentence for repetition: “It’s impossible for words to
        describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means.”
        How, then, to learn what ‘horror means’ … (even in an armchair)?

        Some scene-setting extracts
        <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx">from</a>
        H.P. Lovecraft’s review essay
        <em>Supernatural Horror in Literature</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest
          and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. These facts few
          psychologists will dispute, and their admitted truth must establish
          for all time the genuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale
          as a literary form.</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it
          demands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity
          for detachment from every-day life. Relatively few are free enough
          from the spell of the daily routine to respond to rappings from
          outside …</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>Because we remember pain and the menace of death more vividly than
          pleasure, and because our feelings toward the beneficent aspects of
          the unknown have from the first been captured and formalised by
          conventional religious rituals, it has fallen to the lot of the darker
          and more maleficent side of cosmic mystery to figure chiefly in our
          popular supernatural folklore. This tendency, too, is naturally
          enhanced by the fact that uncertainty and danger are always closely
          allied; thus making any kind of an unknown world a world of peril and
          evil possibilities. When to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable
          fascination of wonder and curiosity is superadded, there is born a
          composite body of keen emotion and imaginative provocation whose
          vitality must of necessity endure as long as the human race itself.
          Children will always be afraid of the dark, and men with minds
          sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought of
          the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in
          the gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in
          unholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can
          glimpse.</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody
          bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain
          atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown
          forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a
          seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most
          terrible conception of the human brain—a malign and particular
          suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only
          safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed
          space.</em>
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <em>The one test of the really weird is simply this—whether or not there
          be excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact
          with unknown spheres and powers; a subtle attitude of awed listening,
          as if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside

        <em>Before Poe the bulk of weird writers had worked largely in the dark;
          without an understanding of the psychological basis of the horror
          appeal, and hampered by more or less of conformity to certain empty
          literary conventions such as the happy ending, virtue rewarded, and in
          general a hollow moral didacticism, acceptance of popular standards
          and values, and striving of the author to obtrude his own emotions
          into the story and take sides with the partisans of the majority’s
          artificial ideas. Poe, on the other hand, perceived the essential
          impersonality of the real artist; and knew that the function of
          creative fiction is merely to express and interpret events and
          sensations as they are, regardless of how they tend or what they
          prove—good or evil, attractive or repulsive, stimulating or
          depressing—with the author always acting as a vivid and detached
          chronicler rather than as a teacher, sympathiser, or vendor of
          opinion. He saw clearly that all phases of life and thought are
          equally eligible as subject-matter for the artist, and being inclined
          by temperament to strangeness and gloom, decided to be the interpreter
          of those powerful feeling, and frequent happenings which attend pain
          rather than pleasure, decay rather than growth, terror rather than
          tranquillity, and which are fundamentally either adverse or
          indifferent to the tastes and traditional outward sentiments of
          mankind, and to the health, sanity, and normal expansive welfare of
          the species.</em>

          strange and forbidding nature of the scene into which they were

          twilight all terrors might well lurk; the hordes of coppery Indians
          whose strange, saturnine visages and violent customs hinted strongly

          of Puritan theocracy to all manner of notions respecting man’s
          relation to the stern and vengeful God of the Calvinists, and to the
          sulphureous Adversary of that God, about whom so much was thundered in
          the pulpits each Sunday; and the morbid introspection developed by an
          isolated backwoods life devoid of normal amusements and of the
          recreational mood, harassed by commands for theological
          self-examination, keyed to unnatural emotional repression, and forming
          above all a mere grim struggle for survival—all these things conspired
          to produce an environment in which the black whisperings of sinister
          grandams were heard far beyond the chimney corner, and in which tales

          realistic acuteness…. Of Mr. Machen’s horror-tales the most famous is

          only an appreciative shudder and a tendency to repeat the words of one
          of the characters: “It is too incredible, too monstrous; such things

        <h4 class="post-title">Abstract Horror (Part 1)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        When conceived rigorously as a literary and cinematic craft, horror is
        indistinguishable from a singular task:
        <i>to make an object of the unknown, as the unknown</i>. Only in these
        terms can its essential accomplishments be estimated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To isolate the abstract purpose of horror, therefore, does not require a
        supplementary philosophical operation. Horror defines itself through a
        pact with abstraction, of such primordial compulsion that disciplined
        metaphysics can only struggle, belatedly, to recapture it. Some sublime
        ‘thing’ — abstracted radically from what it is for us — belongs to
        horror long before reason sets out on its pursuit. Horror first
        encounters ‘that’ which philosophy eventually seeks to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        High modernism in literature has been far less enthralled by the project
        of abstraction than its contemporary developments in the visual arts, or
        even in music. Reciprocally, abstraction in literature, as exemplified
        most markedly by the extremities of Miltonic darkness – whilst arguably
        ‘modern’ — is desynchronized by centuries from the climax of modernist
        experimentation. Abstraction in literary horror has coincided with, and
        even anticipated, philosophical explorations which the modernist
        aesthetic canon has been able to presuppose. Horror – under other names
        – has exceeded the modernist zenith in advance, and with an inverted
        historical orientation that reaches back to the “Old Night” of Greek
        mystery religion, into abysmal antiquity (and archaic abysses). Its
        abstraction is an excavation that progresses relentlessly into the deep
        past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The destination of horror cannot be,
        exactly, a ‘place’ – but it is not inaccurate, at least provisionally,
        to think in such terms. It is into, and beyond, the structuring
        framework of existence that the phobotropic intelligence is drawn.
        Lovecraft
        <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/nwwf.aspx">describes</a>
        the impulse well:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I choose weird stories because they suit my inclination best—one of
          my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve, momentarily,
          the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the galling
          limitations of time, space, and natural law which for ever imprison us
          and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic spaces beyond
          the radius of our sight and analysis. These stories frequently
          emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest and
          strongest emotion, and the one which best lends itself to the creation
          of nature-defying illusions. Horror and the unknown or the strange are
          always closely connected, so that it is hard to create a convincing
          picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or “outsideness”
          without laying stress on the emotion of fear. The reason why
          <strong>time</strong> plays a great part in so many of my tales is
          that this element looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic
          and grimly terrible thing in the universe.
          <strong>Conflict with time</strong> seems to me the most potent and
          fruitful theme in all human expression.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A monster, in comparison, can be no more than a guide — unless it fuses
        (like Yog Sothoth) into the enveloping extracosmic fabric, as a
        super-sentient concentration of doors. We can nevertheless avail
        ourselves of these guides, whose monstrosity — ‘properly understood’ —
        says much about the path to the <em>unnameable</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        James Cameron’s 1989
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096754/">movie</a>
        <em>The Abyss</em> is not atmospherically associated with our topic, but
        it recommends itself to this investigation not only through its title,
        but also in a single critical moment of its screenplay. When the
        <em>others</em> (whose positive nature need not delay us here) are first
        registered by certain technical indications, they are identified only as
        “something not us.” In this respect, they reach the initial stage of
        monstrosity, which is ‘simple’ <em>beyondness</em>, considered as a
        leading characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sinister-punk writer China Miéville, whose horror projects typically
        fail the test of abstraction, is convincing on this point.
        Tentacle-monsters lend themselves to horrific divinity precisely because
        they are not at all ‘us’ — sublimed beyond the prospect of
        anthropomorphic recognition by their “Squidity”. In comparison to the
        humanoid figure of intelligent being, they exert a preliminary repulsive
        force, which is already an increment of abstraction. Insectoid forms
        (such as the fabled Alexian Mantis) have a comparable traditional role.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be a feeble monstrosity, however, that came to rest in some
        such elementary negation. The intrinsically seething, plastic forms of
        cephalopods and of ungraspably complex insectoid beings already advances
        to a further stage of corporeal abstraction, where
        <em>another form</em> is supplanted by <em>an other to form</em>, and an
        intensified alienation of apprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cinema, due — paradoxically — to its strict bonds of sensible
        concreteness, provides especially vivid examples of this elevated
        monstrosity. The commitment of film to the task of horror provokes
        further subdivision, along a spectrum of amorphousness. The initial
        escape from form is represented by a process of unpredictable mutation,
        such as that graphically portrayed in David Cronenberg’s
        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/"><em>The Fly</em></a>
        (1986), subverting in sequence every moment of perceptual purchase along
        with its corollary morphological object. Monstrosity is a continuous
        slide, or process of becoming, that does not look like anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the mutant there is a superior amorphousness, belonging to the
        monster that has no intrinsic form of its own, or even an inherent
        morphological trajectory. This shape-shifting horror occupies the high
        plateau of cinematic monstrosity, as exemplified by three creatures
        which can be productively discussed in concert: <em>The Thing</em> (<a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_%281982_film%29">1982</a>); the Alien (<a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28franchise%29">franchise</a>); and the Terminator (<a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29">franchise</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        These monsters share an extreme positive abstraction. In each case, they
        borrow the shape of their prey, so that what one sees — what cinema
        shows — is only <em>how they hunt</em>. As the <em>Alien</em> and
        <em>Terminator</em> franchises have evolved, this basic abstract trait
        has become increasingly explicit, undergoing narrative and visual
        consolidation. The first Terminator had already been built to mimic
        human form, but by the second installment of the series (Cameron, 1991),
        the T-1000 was a liquid metal robotic predator with a body of poised
        flow, wholly submerging form in military function. Similarly, the
        mutable Alien body, over the course of the franchise, attained an ever
        higher state of morphological variability as it melded with its
        predatory cycle.  (That the Thing had no appearance separable from those
        of its prey was ‘evident’ from the start.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After the T-1000 is frozen and shattered, it gradually thaws, and begins
        to re-combine into itself, flowing back together from its state of
        disintegration. Is not this convergent wave the ‘shape’ of Skynet
        itself? What cannot be seen is made perceptible, through graphic horror.
        (We now ‘see’ that technocommercial systems, whose catallactic being is
        a strictly analogous convergent wave, belong indubitably to the world of
        horror, and await their cinematographers.)

      <p><strong>Zack</strong></p>
      <p>
        Zombies lower the tone, in innumerable ways. Socio-biological decay is
        their natural element, carrying life towards a zero-degree affectivity,
        without neutralizing a now-repulsive animation. They exist to be
        slaughtered — in
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/zombie-hunger/">retaliation</a> —
        which in turn furthers their descent through the pulp-Darwinism of
        entertainment media, to the depths of senselessness where victory is
        all-but-assured. As the world comes apart into dynamic slime, popular
        horror is increasingly infested with zombies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When envisaged as a military antagonist at the global scale,
        <a href="http://maxbrooks.com/books-wwz.php">Max Brooks</a> calls ‘them’
        <em>Zack</em> (amongst other things). If ‘Charlie’ abbreviates ‘Victor
        Charlie’ as a casual jargon noun for the Viet Cong, how is ‘Zack’
        derived? Brooks offers no specific answer. It seems at least plausible
        that ‘Zombie Apocalypse’ is the term that undergoes compression. In any
        case, ‘Zack’ is name with a future, providing a concise collective — or
        dense — noun for a monstrous syndrome that looms beyond the historical
        horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Zack’, like ‘Charlie’, is the enemy,
        nicknamed with an informality designed for stress reduction. The
        intensity of the tag is associated with its ambivalence, as an
        affectionate moniker that liberates or legitimates unrestricted killing.
        ‘Zack’ sounds like ‘he’ could be our buddy, so we can unleash violence
        upon ‘him’ without qualm or inhibition. However odd this psychological
        formula may sound, it is one that Brooks inherits, rather than invents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charlie is already an abstraction from ethical familiarity, but nothing
        like Zack. Where we end, Zack begins, recruiting our corpses into undead
        swarms. Our calamities are ‘his’ ammunition, because Zack is sheer
        weaponry, the first true instantiation of total war, perfectly
        incarnating antagonism to human survival. Zack is
        <em>nothing but</em> the enemy, ‘who’ — entirely devoid of
        non-belligerent purpose or interests — cannot be terrorized,
        intimidated, or deterred. Scare Zack? One has no less chance of scaring
        a cold virus. So things always return to the same basic conclusion: Zack
        has to be killed, as nothing has before (even though — or especially
        because — it is already dead).
      </p>
      <p>
        Brooks is a zombie
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-notes-23-2/">neo-traditionalist</a>. His re-animated undead shuffle
        (slowly). They propagate by
        cannibalistic contagion. Only head-wounds terminate them. But zombies
        are not the monsters. <em>Zack is the monster</em>. It is the syndrome —
        the convergent wave — that realizes the phenomenon, as a matter of
        spreading swarms, or irreducible populations.

      </p>
      <p>
        Tactically, Zack’s strength is number, overwhelming resistance, and
        replenishing itself from the casualties it inflicts. Strategically, it
        prevails through <em>system shock</em>, patterned as epidemic, and
        registered not as the ‘individual’ humanoid ghoul, but as an emergent,
        global <em>outbreak</em>. There is no prospect of rational or
        ‘dispassionately’ effective counter-action until it is understood that
        Zack is no mere ghoulish horde but a <em>singular planetary trauma</em>.
        Zack is total stress.

        Brooks
        <a href="http://www.bookish.com/articles/world-war-z-author-max-brooks-on-being-a-zombie-guy">insists</a>
        upon the realism of his methods:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The zombies may be fake, but I wanted everything else in “World War
          Z” to be real. Just like with “The Zombie Survival Guide,” I wanted
          the story to be rooted in hard facts. That’s why I researched the real
          geopolitics of the world in the early 21st century, the military
          science, the macroeconomics and the cultural quirks of each country I
          was writing about. As creative as I think I am, I also know that I
          can’t invent anything as interesting (or scary) as the real planet we
          live on. As a history nerd, I also wanted to ground the book in our
          species’ life story. Nothing in “World War Z” was made up, it all
          really happened: Yonkers was Isandlwana; the Chinese cover-up was
          SARS. There’s nothing zombies can do to us that we haven’t already
          done to each other.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the world, exactly as it is, and postulate a radical stressor as
        historical destination. Engineer, with all possible precision, a
        speculative collision with utter disaster — a total world war that is
        also a plague, a precipice of bio-social degeneration, and a universal
        psychotic episode — that’s Zack. Understandably,  people will be
        reluctant to describe this method as <em>ultimate realism</em>.
        Nevertheless, as things messily unwind, we’re going to hear much more
        about it.

        <h4 class="post-title">Abstract Horror (Part 2)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Among literary genres, horror cannot claim an exclusive right to make
        contact with reality. Superficially, its case for doing so at all might
        seem peculiarly weak, since it rarely appeals to generally accepted
        criteria of ‘realism’. Insofar as reality and normality are in any way
        confused, horror immediately finds itself exiled to those spaces of
        psychological and social aberrance, where extravagant delusion finds its
        precarious refuge.

        Yet, precisely through its freedom from plausible representation, horror
        hoards to itself a potential for the <em>realization of encounters</em>,
        of a kind that are exceptional to literature, and rare even as a
        hypothetical topic within philosophy. The intrinsic abstraction of the
        horrific entity carves out the path to a meeting, native to the
        intelligible realm, and thus unscreened by the interiority or
        subjectivity of fiction. What horror explores is the sort of thing that,
        due to its plasticity and beyondness, could make its way into your
        thoughts more capably that you do yourself. Whatever the secure mental
        ‘home’ you imagine yourself to possess, it is an indefensible playground
        for the things that horror invokes, or responds to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experience of profound horror is in
        certain respects unusual, and a life entirely bereft of it would not
        seem notably peculiar. One might go further, and propose that if such an
        experience is ever truly possible, the universe is demonstrably
        uninhabitable. Horror makes an ultimate and intolerable claim, as
        suggested by its insidious familiarity. At the brink of its encroachment
        there is suggested, simultaneously, an ontologically self-confirming
        occurrence — indistinguishable from its own reality — and a
        comprehensive substitution of the commonplace, such that this
        (unbearable thing) is what you have always known, and the only thing
        that can be known. The slightest glimpse of it is the radical abolition
        of anything other being imaginable at all. <em>Nothing matters</em>,
        then, except that this glimpse be eluded. Hence the literary effect of
        the horrific, in unconfirmed suggestion (felt <em>avoidance</em> of
        horror). However, it is not the literary effect that concerns us here,
        but the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us assume then (no doubt preposterously) that <em>shoggoth</em> is
        that thing, the thought of which is included — or absorbed — within
        itself. H.P. Lovecraft dramatizes this conjecture in the fictional
        biography of the ‘mad Arab’ Abdul Alhazred, ‘author’ of the
        <em>Necronomicon</em>, whose writings tend to an encounter that they
        simultaneously preclude:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or
          portrayed by any beings. The mad author of the Necronomicon had
          nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet, and
          that only drugged dreamers had even conceived them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>This is a point insisted upon:</p>
      <p>
        <em>These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered
          about as the ‘Shoggoths’ in his frightful Necronomicon, though even
          that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the
          dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A lucid written record of these ‘creatures’ cannot exist, because the
        world we know has carried on. That can, at least, be permitted to
        persist as a provisional judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a ferocious summer day, in AD 738, Alhazred is walking through the
        central market of Damascus on business unknown. He appears to be deep in
        thought, and disengaged from his surroundings. The crowds in the
        marketplace scarcely notice him. Without warning, the air is rent by
        hideous shrieks, testifying to suffering beyond human comprehension.
        Alhazred convulses abominably, as if he were being drawn upwards into an
        invisible, devouring entity, or <em>digested out of the world</em>. His
        screams gurgle into silence, as his body is filthily extracted from
        perceptibility. Within only a few moments, nothing remains. The adequate
        thought of shoggoth has taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
        To defend the sober realism of this account is no easy task. A first
        step is grammatical, and concerns the difficult matter of plurality.
        Lovecraft, plotting an expedition from the conventions of pulp fiction,
        readily succumbs to the model of plural entity, and refers to
        ‘shoggoths’ without obvious hesitation. ‘Each’  shoggoth has approximate
        magnitude (averaging “about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere”).
        They were originally replicated as tools, and are naturally many.
        Despite being “shapeless entities composed of a viscous jelly which
        looked like an agglutination of bubbles … constantly shifting shape and
        volume” they seem, initially, to be numerable. This grammatical
        conformity will not be supportable for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Shoggoths’ come from beyond the bionic horizon, so it is to be expected
        that their organization is dissolved in functionality. ‘They’ are
        “infinitely plastic and ductile […] protoplasmic masses capable of
        molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs […] throwing
        out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing,
        and speech.” What they are is what they do, or — for a time — what is
        done through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shoggoths originated as tools — as technology — created by the Old
        Ones as bionic robots, or construction machinery. Their shape,
        organization, and behavior was programmable (“hypnotically”). In the
        vocabulary of human economic science, we should have no problem
        describing shoggoth as productive apparatus, that is to say, as
        <em>capital</em>. Yet this description requires elaboration, because the
        story is far from complete:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of
          the Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various
          useful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers
          were sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative forms
          implanted by past suggestion. They had, it seems, developed a
          semistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition
          echoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideas of ‘robot rebellion’ or capital insurgency are crude
        precursors to the realization of shoggoth, conceived as intrinsically
        abstract, techno-plastic, bionically auto-processing matter, of the kind
        that Lovecraft envisages intersecting terrestrial geophysics in the
        distance past, scarring it cryptically. Shoggoth is a virtual
        plasma-state of material capability that logically includes, within
        itself, all natural beings. It builds brains as technical sub-functions.
        Whatever brains can think, shoggoth can can process, as an arbitrary
        specification of protoplasmic — or perhaps <em>hyperplasmic</em> —
        abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and
          processes – viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells – rubbery
          fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile – slaves of
          suggestion, builders of cities – more and more sullen, more and more
          intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and more imitative! Great
          God! What madness made even those blasphemous Old Ones willing to use
          and carve such things?</em>
      </p>
      <p>The history of capitalism is indisputably a horror story …</p>

        <h4 class="post-title">Abstract Horror (Note-1)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        On twitter @SamoBurja has proposed the silence of the galaxy as an
        undeveloped horrorist topic. He’s right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The absence of any signs of alien intelligence was first noted as a
        problem by Enrico Fermi in 1950. He found the gaping inconsistency
        between the apparent probability of widespread life in the cosmos and
        its obvious invisibility provocative to the point of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">paradox</a>. “Where
        are they?” he asked. (Responses to this question, well represented in
        the Wikipedia references, have constituted a significant current of
        cosmological speculation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Among recent thinkers, Nick Bostrom has been especially dogged in
        pursuing the
        <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf">implications</a>
        of the Fermi Paradox. Approaching the problem through systematic
        statistical ontology, he has shown that it suggests a ‘thing’ — a ‘Great
        Filter’ that <em>at some stage</em> winnows down potential galactic
        civilizations to negligible quantities. If this filtering does not
        happen early — due to astro-chemical impediments to the emergence of
        life — it has to apply later. Consistently, he considers any indications
        of abundant galactic life to be ominous in the extreme. A
        <em>Late</em> Great Filter would then still lie ahead (for us). Whatever
        it is, we would be on our approach to an encounter with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With every new exo-planet discovery, the
        Great Filter becomes darker. A galaxy teeming with life is a horror
        story. The less there is obstructing our being born, the more there is
        waiting to kill or ruin us.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we could clearly envision the calamity that awaited us, it would be
        an object of terror. Instead, it is a shapeless threat, ‘Outside’ only
        in the abstract sense (encompassing the negative immensity of everything
        that we cannot grasp). It could be anywhere, from our genes or
        ecological dynamics, to the hidden laws of technological evolution, or
        the hostile vastnesses between the stars. We know only that, in strict
        proportion to the vitality of the cosmos, the probability of its
        existence advances towards inevitability, and that for us it means
        supreme ill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ontological density without identifiable form is abstract horror itself.
        As the Great Filter drifts inexorably, from a challenge that we might
        imaginably have already overcome, to an encounter we ever more
        fatalistically expect, horrorism is thickened by
        statistical-cosmological vindication. The unknown condenses into a
        shapeless, predatory <em>thing</em>. Through our techno-scientific
        sensors and calculations, the Shadow mutters to us, and probability
        insists that we shall meet it soon.

        <em>Most models of dark energy hold that the amount of it remains
          constant. But about 10 years ago, cosmologists realised that if the
          total density of dark energy is increasing, we could be headed for a
          nightmare scenario – the “big rip”. As space-time expands faster and
          faster, matter will be torn apart, starting with galaxy clusters and
          ending with atomic nuclei. Cosmologists called it “phantom”
          energy.</em>

      <em>
        <p>
          To find out if this could be true, Dragan Huterer at the University of
          Michigan in Ann Arbor turned to type Ia supernovae. These stellar
          explosions are all of the same brightness, so they act as cosmic
          yardsticks for measuring distances. The first evidence that the
          universe’s expansion is accelerating came from studies of type Ia
          supernovae in the late 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
          If supernovae accelerated away from each other more slowly in the past
          than they do now, then dark energy’s density may be increasing and we
          could be in trouble. “If you even move a millimetre off the ledge, you
          fall into the abyss,” Huterer says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Huterer and colleague Daniel Shafer have compiled data from recent
          supernova surveys and found that, depending on which surveys you use,
          there could be slight evidence that the dark energy density has been
          increasing over the past 2 billion years, but it’s not statistically
          significant yet (<strong>Physical Review D</strong>,
          <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.063510">doi.org/vf9</a>).
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>Phantom energy is an underdog theory, but the consequences are so
          dramatic that it’s worth testing, Huterer says. The weakness of the
          evidence is balanced by the fact that the implications are huge, he
          says. “We will have to completely revise even our current thinking of
          dark energy if phantom is really at work.”</em>

        (If I’d been making this stuff up, about the entirety of cosmic space
        being a concealed monster poised to rip every particle in the universe
        apart, I’d have named the hero ‘Dragan

        <em>It thus naturally tends to seize semantically on the substantiality
          of the negative and on what might have been said otherwise but was not
          — a <strong>not</strong> that is felt to contain the secret of
          everything. For example, Meister Eckhart’s exegesis of Paul’s blinding
          vision on the road to Damascus entirely ignores the ordinary, regular
          sense of “and when his eyes were opened he saw nothing” (Acts 9:8)
          [<strong>apertisque oculis nihil videbat</strong>] in favor of a
          mystically literal plenitude of possibilities: “I think this text has
          a fourfold sense. One is that when he rose up from the ground with
          open eyes he saw Nothing, and the Nothing was God; for when he saw God
          he calls that Nothing. The second: when he got up he saw nothing but
          God. The third: in all things he saw nothing but God. The fourth: when
          he saw God, he saw all things as nothing.”[2] Similarly, Augustine’s
          well-known statement as to the unknowable knowability of time — “What
          therefore is time? If no one [<strong>nemo</strong>] asks me, I know;
          if I want to explain it to someone questioning me, I do not know”[3] —
          may be (im)properly read as saying that time is known in the
          positively negative presence of a nemo, a not-man
          (<strong>ne</strong>+<strong>homo</strong>) who asks about time, a
          pure question posed by nobody. The presence of this no-one who is
          still there, a senseless letter-spirit and sudden negative indication
          upon which superlative understanding depends, provides a fitting
          structural figure for this method and an image of its divinatory,
          daimonic form, its sortilegic reading of received signs.

          <p>
            Within the Western tradition, the expedition to find Kurtz at the end of
            the river has a single overwhelming connotation. It is a voyage to Hell.
            Hence its absolute importance, utterly exceeding narrow ‘mission
            specifications’. The  assigned  objectives are no more than a pretext,
            arranging the terms of approach to an ultimate destination. The
            narrative drive, as it gathers momentum, is truly infernal. Dark
            Enlightenment is the commanding attraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no doubt species of reactionary political and historical
            philosophy which remain completely innocent of such impulses. Almost
            certainly, they predominate over their morbid associates. To maintain a
            retrograde psychological orientation, out of reverence for what has
            been, and is ceasing to be, can reasonably be opposed to any journey to
            the end of the night. Yet such a contrast only sharpens our
            understanding of those for whom the disintegration of tradition
            describes a gradient, and a vector, propelling intelligence forwards
            into the yawning abyss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaction is articulated as an inversion of
            the progressive promise, dissociating ‘the good’ and ‘the future’. The
            tacit science fiction narrative that corresponds to projected social
            evolution is stripped of its optimism, and two alternative genres arise
            in its place. The first, as we have fleetingly noted, is mild and
            nostalgic, rebalancing the tension of time towards what has been lost,
            and tending to an increasingly dreamlike inhabitation of ancient
            glories. A conservative-traditionalist  mentality devotes itself to a
            mnemonic quest, preserving vestiges of virtue among the remnants of an
            eroded society, or — when preservation at last surrenders its grasp on
            actuality — turning to fantastic evocations, as the final redoubt of
            defiance. Tolkien exemplifies this tendency in its most systematic
            expression. The future is gently obliterated, as the good dies within
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reactionary alternative to the ruin of utopian futurism
            develops in the direction of horror. It does not hesitate in its voyage
            to the end of the river, even as smoke-shrouded omens thicken on the
            horizon. As the devastation deepens, its futurism is further
            accentuated.  Historical projection becomes the opportunity for an
            exploration of Hell. (The ‘neo-‘ of ‘neoreaction’ thus finds additional
            confirmation.)
          </p>
          <p>
            On this track, reactionary historical anticipation fuses with the genre
            of horror in its most intense possibility (and true vocation). Numerous
            consequences are quite rapidly evident. One special zone of significance
            concerns the
            <a href="http://nydwracu.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/what-is-to-be-done/">insistent</a>
            question of <em>popularization</em>, which is substantially resolved,
            almost from the start. The genre of reactionary populism is already
            tightly formulated, on the side of horror fiction, where
            <em>things going to Hell</em> is an established presupposition. Zombie
            Apocalypse is only the most prominent variant of a far more general
            cultural accommodation to impending disaster. ‘Survivalism’ is as much a
            genre convention as a socio-political expectation. (When, as VXXC points
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/discrimination/#comments">out</a> on
            the blog, .22 ammunition functions as virtual currency, horror fiction
            has already installed itself as an operational dimension of social
            reality.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaction does not do dialectics, or converse with the Left (with which
            it has no community), yet historical fatality carries its message:
            <em>Your hopes are our horror story</em>. As the dream perishes, the
            nightmare strengthens, and even — hideously — invigorates. So how does
            this tale unfold …?

            <h4 class="post-title">Horrorism</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Neoreaction, as it tends to extremity on its Dark Enlightenment vector,
            frustrates all familiar demands for activism. Even if explicit
            anti-politics remains a minority posture, the long-dominant demotic
            calculus of political possibility is consistently subverted — coring out
            the demographic constituencies from which ‘mobilization’ might be
            expected. There is no remotely coherent reactionary class, race, or
            creed — it painstakingly explains — from which a tide-reversing mass
            politics could be constructed. In this respect, even the mildest
            versions of neoreactionary analysis are profoundly politically
            disillusioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            When demotist ideologies have entered into superficially comparable
            crises, they have forked into ‘realist’ compromisers and ‘terrorist’
            ultras. The latter option, which substitutes a violent intensification
            of political will for the erosion of the extensive (popular) factor, is
            an especially reliable indicator of demotism entering an idealist state,
            in which its essential ideological features are exposed with peculiar
            clarity. Terrorists are the vehicles of political ideas which have been
            stranded by a receding tide of social identity, and are thus freed to
            perfect themselves in abstraction from mass practicality. Once a
            revolutionary movement becomes demographically implausible, terrorists
            are born.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neoreactionary realism, in contrast, is
            positively aligned with the recession of demotic sustenance. If this
            were not the case, it would exhibit its own specific mode of democratic
            politics — an evident absurdity. Any suggestion of frustrated rage,
            tilting into terroristic expressions, would immediately reveal profound
            confusion, or hypocrisy. Lashing the masses into ideological
            acquiescence, through exemplary violence, cannot imaginably be a
            neoreactionary objective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Demotist activism finds its rigorous neoreactionary ‘counterpart’ in
            <em>fatalism</em> — trichotomized as providence, heredity, and
            catallaxy. Each of these strands of fate work their way out in the
            absence of mass political endorsement, with a momentum that
            <em>builds</em> through the dissolution of organized compensatory
            action. Rather than attempting to make something happen, fatality
            restores something that cannot be stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is thus that the approximate contours of the horrorist task emerge
            into focus. Rather than resisting the desperation of the progressive
            ideal by terrorizing its enemies, it directs itself to the culmination
            of progressive despair in the abandonment of
            <em>reality compensation</em>. It de-mobilizes, de-massifies, and
            de-democratizes, through subtle, singular, catalytic interventions,
            oriented to the realization of fate. The Cathedral has to be horrified
            into paralysis. The horrorist message (to its enemies):
            <em>Nothing that you are doing can possibly work</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What is to be done?” is not a neutral question. The agent it invokes
            already strains towards progress. This suffices to suggest a horrorist
            response: <em>Nothing</em>. Do nothing. Your progressive ‘praxis’ will
            come to nought in any case. Despair. Subside into horror. You can
            pretend to prevail in antagonism against ‘us’, but reality is your true
            — and fatal — enemy. We have no interest in shouting at you. We whisper,
            gently, in your ear: “despair”. (The horror.)

          <p>
            At the point where people have begun to
            <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/accounting-great-divergence">talk</a>
            about “a positive Black Death effect” do they realize how far they’ve
            descended into the shadows? The hard-core horror of Malthusian analysis
            always has some new depths to fathom.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea that European living standards rose following the ‘relief’ from
            Malthusian pressure gifted by bubonic plague is far from new. It is even
            something approaching an uncontroversial fact of economic history. To
            take an additional step, however, and attribute the rise of the West to
            its mid-14th century epidemic devastation, is to wander into unexplored
            tracts of icy
            <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/07/social_darwinis.html">misanthropy</a>. <em>Europe was
              lucky
              enough to have enough people die</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Malthusian implication (<a
              href="http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/a_farewell_to_alms.html">systematized</a>
            by Gregory Clark) that only downward social mobility is compatible with
            eugenic trends, is a dark thought I have touched upon
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-monkey-trap/">occasionally</a>,
            but have yet to firmly fix upon. The idea of mass population destruction
            as a developmental gift, in any situation where economic growth rates
            fall below average fertility (I simplify), takes Dark Enlightenment to a
            whole other level.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a footnote, it raises the question: was the Great Divergence eugenic
            for the Far East (which fell behind) and dysgenic for the West (which
            forged ahead)? Is economic prosperity essentially a gene trasher?
          </p>
          <p>
            I tend to side with libertarians in their aversion to (Keynesian)
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_window_fallacy">broken window</a>
            economics, but it is to be expected that such reasoning will promptly
            subside into sheer cognitive paralysis when the far more disturbing
            Malthusian conclusions are introduced. Libertarians already think
            they’ve ‘got’ Malthus, as the guy who lost the Simon-Ehrlich
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager">wager</a>
            — an anti-capitalist green prophet preaching population restriction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real Malthus is going to come as a shock. He certainly spine-chills
            me.

            <h4 class="post-title">Mission Creep</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Sensation — media nourishment — is situated on a border. It tells the
            inside something about the outside, and is shaped from both sides. The
            outside is what it is, which might not be perceptible, or acceptable.
            The inside wants relevant information, selected and formatted to its
            purposes. Sensation is therefore where subject and object meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            … that’s an attempt to express preliminary sympathy for Matt Sigl’s
            situation, caught between an uncanny <em>thing</em> and a definite
            <em>agenda</em>. Concretely; research collides with editing, with Sigl’s
            brain as ground zero. The encounter of Neoreaction with the media is a
            peculiarly vicious one, with the sensations to match.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crudely speaking, Neoreaction is disgust at the media condensed into an
            ideology. While generally contemptuous of the human fodder making up
            modern democracies, Neoreaction principally targets the media-academic
            complex (or ‘Cathedral’) for antagonism, because it is the media that is
            the real ‘electorate’ — telling voters what to do. This foundational
            critique, on its own, would be enough to ensure intense reciprocal
            loathing. Of course, it is not on its own. Neoreaction is in almost
            every respect the Cathedral anti-message, which is to say that it is
            consistently, radically, and defiantly ‘off-message’ on every topic of
            significance, and is thus something unutterably horrible. Yet utterance
            — it now seems — there has to be …
          </p>
          <p>
            So what appears on the boundary — or
            <em>sensationally</em> — is something remarkably
            <a
              href="https://www.vocativ.com/12-2013/dark-enlightenment-creepy-internet-movement-youd-better-take-seriously/"><strong>creepy</strong></a>.
            As a deeply resonant public communication of what has just
            <em>happened</em>, and continues to happen, as well as what has been
            editorially decided, this word is almost too exquisite to contemplate.
            We can at least burrow down into it a little way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What is creepiness exactly?</em> The intractability of this question
            <strong><em>is</em></strong> the phenomenon (which is not a phenomenon,
            exactly). Creepiness is not quite what it seems, and this insinuation of
            the unknown, or intrinsic inexactness, is something horrible that
            exceeds the initial sensation of revulsion. It suggests a revelation in
            stages, complicated by successive revisions, but leading inexorably,
            ever deeper, into an encounter one recoils from, sensing (inexactly)
            that it will be ultimately found intolerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s already a little horror story, most probably with a female
            protagonist (as acutely noted
            <a
              href="http://amosandgromar.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/matt-sigl-on-the-dark-enlightenment-white-creepy-and-smart/">at</a>
            <em>Amos &amp; Gromar</em>). From the very beginning, it
            <em>feels</em> sinister. One cannot see exactly why, because one cannot
            bear to see. The imprecision of perception is already protective, or
            evasive, serving dramatically as an ominous inkling of the blinding
            panic, wild flight, and screaming that must surely come. You really
            don’t want to see it, even though (<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/horrorism/">horribly</a>) you know
            that
            you
            have to, because it could be dangerous. As the
            lurid movie posters shriek sensationally, it’s a thing
            <strong>You’d Better Take Seriously</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is journalism eating itself, or being eaten, in a an encounter with
            something monstrous from Outside.
            <em>Look at this thing you won’t be able to look at</em> (without
            moaning in horror). <em>Watch what you can’t bear to see</em>. It tilts
            over into a kind of madness, which couldn’t be more obvious, or less
            clearly perceptible. Sigl’s editors have been sucked into a vortex of
            horrific sensationalism that draws attention to the one thing they are
            duty-bound to hide from people. It <em>has</em> to be creepy, that is:
            imperceptible at the very moment it is seen. The approved response to
            Neoreaction is to be <em>creeped out</em>, but that can’t possibly be
            enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first we might think that ‘creepy’ is a
            <em>subjective adjective</em>, describing something too horrible to
            describe. It’s tempting, since we suspect these people retreated into
            their feelings long ago. The reality is far creepier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things really creep, although not exactly objectively, when they proceed
            in a way you’re not quite able to perceive. Evidently, Moldbug
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com">sees</a> this
            (“<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">Something is happening here</a>. But you
            don’t
            know what it is — do you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_of_a_Thin_Man#Interpretation">Mr. Jones</a>?”).
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to imagine you’re the media to carry on further into the horror
            story. Then you can see that it’s creepy in part (always in parts),
            because you let it in. That shrieking thing you were
            <a href="http://davidbrin.blogspot.ca/2013/11/neo-reactionaries-drop-all-pretense-end.html">doing</a>?
            Perhaps
            you
            should have taken that as a sign. Now it’s creeping about
            inside, in your media, in your brains, in your dimly unscrutinized
            thoughts, and all those elaborate security systems that you spent so
            long putting together — they’re now mostly an obstacle course for the
            cops, or whoever else you think might imaginably come to your rescue,
            because they’re certainly not standing between you and the Mind Virus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Really, what were you thinking, when you started screaming about it, and
            thus let it in? You don’t know, do you? — and that’s seriously creepy.
            Even though you don’t want to — at all — it makes you think about HBD,
            heredity, instincts, impulses, and incomprehensible chemical machines,
            stealthily at work behind your thoughts, obdurate in their reality, and
            intolerable beyond acknowledgement. Shrieking “Nazi science!” (or
            whatever) doesn’t help, because it’s inside now, and you know it’s true,
            even as you play the hunted heroine mumbling “no, no, no, no, no …”
            backing ever deeper into the shadows.
            <em>This is reality, and it’s already inside</em>, that’s what you were
            saying  when you called it ‘creepy’.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s happening, and there’s no point at all saying “get over it” —
            because you won’t.

            <em>Broaching this subject is also difficult because it has to be handled
              with some nuance (which is difficult to achieve in a discussion of a
              topic as justifiably emotionally-charged as American racism). It would
              be too easy to point to Lovecraft’s racism (and some of his other
              failings as an author), and dismiss him as an undistinguished crackpot
              who deserved nothing better than publication in the pulps. I’m not
              going to do that here. My stance is that Lovecraft made an important
              contribution to horror and science fiction by focusing (in a
              persistent and compellingly imaginative way) on the terror induced by
              the revelation of human non-significance in the cosmos. […] Lovecraft
              has had a meaningful influence over horror fiction (in particular) for
              many years, an influence that transcends his racism. … All of this is
              just a long-winded way of explaining that Lovecraft’s racism doesn’t
              negate his accomplishments.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But his accomplishments don’t negate his racism. (Enter, cognitive
              dissonance).</em>

            Among the most fascinating aspects of this commentary is its blatant
            misdirection, since — of course — the phenomenon indicated
            <em>has nothing whatsoever to do with cognitive dissonance</em>. There
            is an encounter here with an abnormal species of literary genius,
            associated with profound metaphysical truth, which at the same time —
            and for inextricably tangled reasons — triggers a reaction of moral
            panic, tilting over into deep somatic revulsion. In other words, and
            perhaps even quite simply, what is being related by Nicole Cushing is —
            horror.

            When the winter comes, life becomes hard. Do the nice thing, too often,

            Only the most extreme sociopath is oblivious to the comforts of moral
            squeamishness. It almost counts as the basic scaffolding of sanity to
            believe, or to immersively pretend, that our deepest qualms are shared
            by the commanding principles of being. At the highest level of hegemonic
            global culture, such scruples — projected ever more wantonly into the
            nature of things — are represented by Francis Fukuyama’s teleo-zenith
            “liberal democracy” which, as Daniel McCarthy accurately
            <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-liberalism-means-empire/">points</a>
            out, “turns out to be a synonym for ‘the attitudes and institutions of a
            world in which Anglo-American power is dominant.’” Hobbesian realities
            have receded from Western public consciousness in direct proportion to
            the rise of a titanic ‘<a
              href="http://openrevolt.info/2013/02/03/alexander-dugin-the-great-war-of-continents/">Atlantean</a>‘
            power. To
            confuse the gentle webs of civility with fundamental
            structures of reality is decadence, a path that Western sensibilities
            have been traveling for decades, if not centuries. Nothing deep within
            the fabric of the world gets upset about the same things, and in the
            same ways, that we would want it to.

            ‘Children’. That single word, alone, says everything that is necessary
            here. Lost, abandoned, exploited, sick and neglected, crippled, starved,
            and slaughtered, they saturate the media-scape of the harshening Western
            winter. Their real features are hard to discern beneath the thick
            coating of symbolism they bear, as every scale of the media, from
            brainwashed micro-blogger to massive news conglomerate, orchestrates the
            pathetic cry: <em>how can this possibly be allowed to be?</em> There
            should be something, profoundly rooted-down into the nature of the
            world, that cares about tormented and massacred children, shouldn’t
            there? Something other, and more, than the fragile machinery of a
            civilization that now tilts and groans ominously in the rising winter
            wind? When these media-blitzed fate-damned children scrape our moral
            sensitivities down to the raw, bloody quick, there has to be something
            <em>basic</em> concerned to protect them, surely?

            <em>Welcome to the world without the state. Life is, as Thomas Hobbes put
              it, nasty, brutish, and short. Gangs are a common element in 4GW,
              which is what these children find themselves caught up in. Childhood
              as we know it, which is a Victorian creation, vanishes. Child fighters
              were common before the Victorian period; 18th century Royal Navy
              warships often had 12-year old midshipmen and children as young as
              eight serving as powder monkeys. In other parts of today’s world where
              the state has broken down, child soldiers are normal. […] Here is
              where a correct understanding of Fourth Generation war is necessary.
              Mrs. Nazario is right: these children are refugees. As the number of
              failed states grows and disorder spreads, we will see vast floods of
              refugees, millions and tens of millions, all trying to get into one of
              the ever-smaller number of places that remain orderly. Those states,
              including our own, dare not admit them. Why? Because they will bring
              the behaviors they are fleeing with them. It was just this sort of
              immigration that brought down the Roman Empire. The barbarians (except
              perhaps the Vandals) were not invading Rome to destroy it; they were
              moving in, during the same sort of movement of whole peoples,
              <strong>Volkerwanderung</strong>, we now face, seeking the order Rome
              offered. But their numbers were so great they overwhelmed Rome. The
              Dark Ages began as a refugee crisis.</em>

            <h4 class="post-title">Moral Terror</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Before we get around to bravely denouncing — with whatever degree of
            theatricality falls just short of laughable camp — those ‘sociopaths’ or
            ‘psychopaths’ who are effortless indifferent to intuitive qualms,
            perhaps we can agree that such anomalous psychological types are
            definitively
            <em>incapable of
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-note-4/">moral</a>
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/antechamber-to-horror/">terror</a></em>. In this respect, they are
            human
            precursors of that which, from a
            strictly functional point of view, we want our military robotics control
            systems to be. They have no squeamishness to overcome. Stone cold
            killers no doubt exist, and even more certainly soon will. If moral
            terror is the topic, however, they fall entirely outside it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A discussion of the roots of moral intuition far exceeds the reasonable
            ambition of a modest blog post. Those wanting to plug it more or less
            directly into God will do so. Even radical religious skeptics, however,
            are unable to deny the <em>fact</em> of very basic, deeply
            pre-reflective moral commitments as a human norm. The scientific
            literature alone is now
            <a href="http://edge.org/events/the-new-science-of-morality">huge</a>.
            There is no serious controversy about the existence of a ‘sense or right
            and wrong’ (irrespective of its variability regarding specifics) as a
            fundamental component of human evolved psychology. This only needs to be
            said because of widespread childish delusions that ‘moral nihilism’
            could be considered a default condition of the non-indoctrinated human
            individual. ‘Wolf-boy’ is still a moral animal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If moral nihilism is possible at all, it is
            touched upon only at the limit of moral terror, which is to say as a
            <em>horror</em> that is — from the human perspective — absolute. In the
            Western religious tradition it is epitomized by God’s testing of Abraham
            (Genesis 22), which shallow souls are tempted to <em>rush through</em>.
            Abraham fully expected that
            <em>it would be necessary to murder his own son</em>, in compliance with
            a <em>higher purpose</em> (identified with God’s will). There is
            probably no example of moral terror that does not conform, abstractly,
            to this template. Anyone suggesting that the most extreme possibility of
            soul-shuddering horror is in some way external to Biblical Monotheism is
            a fool. The passage through moral terror is a commandment of God — and
            ‘through’ is a retrospective comfort alien to the original divine
            decree.
          </p>
          <p>
            … but forget God (almost everyone
            <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/172844">has</a>). Consider
            instead Thomas
            <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4239/4239-h/4239-h.htm">Malthus</a>, or his most brilliant

            Can anybody read these texts without an immersion in moral terror?
            Our moral sensibilities are cancelled by the blood-mill of history —
            under the iron rule of a higher conservation law — making a horrible
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/malthusian-horror/">jest</a> of even
            our most uncorrupted impulses towards the good. The
            <em>philosophical</em> virtue of the Scottish Enlightenment lay entirely
            in its meditation upon such perversion of purposes. It is from such
            heights that we have fallen into our presently-dominant — lazy,
            cowardly, and despicable — moralistic cant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>How can we advance in accordance with our most sacred moral
              intuitions?</em>
            asks the progressive, who then requests:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Assume the desirability of universal human equality …”<br />
            “No,” responds the Neoreactionary, whose question is rather:
            <em>What are we assuming, that we could instead think about?</em>

              going to be a political programme that will end this problem. But the

            <em>God, according to Dade County’s homeless children, is missing in
              action; demons stormed Heaven a while back and God hasn’t been seen
              since. The mother of Christ murdered her son and morphed into the
              terrifying Bloody Mary, a nightmare being who weeps blood from eyeless
              sockets and seeks out children to kill them. Opposing her is a
              mysterious spirit from the ocean who takes the form of a blue-skinned
              woman, and who can protect children who know her secret name. The
              angels, though driven out of Heaven, haven’t given up; they carry on
              their fight against the demons from a hidden camp in the jungle
              somewhere outside Miami, guarded by friendly alligators who devour
              hostile intruders. The spirits of children who die in Dade County’s
              pervasive gang warfare can go to the camp and join the war against the
              demons, so long as someone who knows the stories puts a leaf on their
              graves.</em>

            Horroristic practice: to seize the collapse of the world as the
            opportunity for an encounter with the Outside. Is this NRx? In all
            probability, no more than symbiotically. The occasion for tactical
            alignment, however, is considerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are twin tracks into the gathering darkness, but horrorism is by
            far the more capable of feeding itself. (The chronic NRx call for
            ‘action’ is a symptom of malnourishment.)

          <p>
            A ‘scrap note’ is what you end up with after dropping  below the level
            of articulacy required for a raw quote (or T-shirt slogan). It’s a
            format dragged out of Cambodia for informal meanderings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This one is here because I’m in the sand-pit, playing the German Army of
            the Great War. First hurl everything at the French (communist
            <a href="http://www.uf-blog.net/on-accelerate-1/">Accelerationism</a>) and try to take them out of the game
            within
            a few months, then wheel
            around for a plunge into Russia, dismantling the Czarists (with a
            hurricane of Neocameralism). Sequenced
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/re-accelerationism/">two</a>-front
            war. It’s a strategy that’s already driven me into narcoleptic
            disintegration, but I’m committed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out here in the Dark East, waiting for news about the titanic Western
            clashes, it’s a time to patch things together with meager resources.
            That’s <em>economy</em>, which is always worth exploring. The specific
            topic of micro-cognition has been nagging at me with unusual ferocity
            ever since crossing over into Twitter. It seems like something close to
            a compulsory adaptation, as the near future chews human psychology into
            hot techno-splinters. If we don’t accept miniaturization as an urgent
            and intimate problem, we’ll eventually collide ruinously with
            nano-hostiles we can’t even perceive.  (So, as always, I think any
            traditionalism without a ‘neo-‘ is already laid out on the sacrificial
            slab.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Languid afternoons with long and difficult books would be the way to go
            — if we had a different future. In the one we have, we’ll receive the
            ancient tomes in scrambled streams, hurtling at us like a particle storm
            out of cyberspace. Lamentable? Perhaps. Avoidable? Almost certainly not.
            So adapt.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/av0v95O?ref=t">This</a> is the sort of
            thing worth thinking about carefully — but in pieces. It’s
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/creepypasta/">creepypasta</a> taken
            to the next level. I was totally ready for it, musing vaguely about
            scaling horror down to the same approximate size while in Cambodia —
            although nothing quite crystallized. The reception of these two-sentence
            micro-nasties suggests that plenty of
            <a href="http://paper.li/Seneca24">other</a> people were tapping into
            the same high-frequency shadow waves. The next stage is compression to
            the 140-characters of a tweet — then it goes into tweet contagion.
            Horrorist memetic warfare. (Did I warn you that grammar gets suspended
            in a scrap note?)
          </p>
          <p>
            A few additional quick-and-dirty points about horrorist method. (1) It’s
            not clicked here yet, which is why this isn’t a horror story. (2) When
            it is, the story has to absorb enough theory to be gratingly ‘meta’ —
            smoothing that out will be a guiding aesthetic imperative. (3) Horrorism
            has to be not only ‘meta’, but also reflexive, or nonlinear, in order to
            deliver its payload across the fiction barrier. It will all seem
            hideously ‘postmodern’ if it isn’t done well, so clunky annoyances will
            abound in the early stages. (Consider that a preliminary down-payment on
            future apologies.) (4) I’m not at all sure there’s anything horrorism
            <em>can’t</em> do … (5) Experiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stepping back from the harsh tracts of horror, there are numerous paths
            of splinter-technique to wander down. Prominent instance:
            <em>numbering</em>. Coming full-circle, the
            <em>#Accelerate</em> manifesto is composed in numbered paragraphs, which
            is formally appealing. It acknowledges a virtual discontinuity, as if
            pre-formatted for the rending to come. With different methods, it could
            facilitate discontinuous composition, providing the assembly codes for a
            whole that arrives in chunks, even out of sequence, or across intervals
            of oblivion. It also references traditions of fragmentary writing
            (Nietzsche, Wittgenstein) in which brevity, or conceptual completion on
            constricted scales, was adopted as a principle of achievement. The
            Internet tide flows in that direction (Moldbug notwithstanding).

            This repulsive, sniveling concession to moralistic coercion is the
            epitome of philosophical cowardice, and a grave offense against any
            decent sense of cognitive hygiene. It’s like protesting to Cotton Mather
            — “Honestly! I’m not a witch!” — when you don’t remotely have to. Having
            been badgered into it by a couple of ankle-biting blowhards is no
            excuse, in my book. They demanded a cheap signal of conformity to
            sovereign stupidity, which is their actual god, and it was surrendered
            to them, in a bleat. The only dignified response to such vulgarity is
            contemptuous silence, or if not that then “Yes, my
            <a href="http://www.imao.us/archives/000567.html">blender</a> is
            encrusted with puppy blood”, but now it’s too late for that. Still,
            never again (I hope). May Gnon sharpen my instincts and stiffen my
            spine.

            <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/2014/08/a-hundred-walked-out-of-my-lecture/">this</a>

            <em>Walking miserably up the High Street I felt profoundly depressed at
              the state of the world. I could cheer myself with the thought that I’d
              learned something. I learned that Islam has yet another nasty
              meme-trick to offer – when you are offended put your hands over your
              ears and run away. This would be funny if it weren’t so serious. These
              bright, but ignorant, young people must be among the more enlightened
              of their contemporaries since their parents have been able and willing
              to send them on this course to learn something new. If even they
              cannot face dissent, or think for themselves, what hope is there for

            … that was (ex-)Detective Rustin “Rust” Cohle, from the final episode of
            <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(TV_series)">True</a>
              <a href="http://www.hbo.com/true-detective#/">Detective</a></em>
            (in case you didn’t recognize it). At the brink of the end, a
            near-mortally wounded Cohle underwent a descent through the loss of his
            “definition”, and beyond the darkness touched upon “another, deeper
            darkness, like a substance” where lost love is restored in
            de-differentiation. The reference to Wagner’s
            <em><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Tristan_und_Isolde.html">Tristan</a>
              und

            As philosophy, Nic Pizzolatto’s <em>True Detective</em> is deeper than
            Wagner, because it holds tighter to the <em>integral obscurity</em> that
            is the ultimate object of horror. Where
            <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> finally reaches musical resolution and
            <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_und_Isolde#Significance_in_the_development_of_classical_music">release</a>
            into eroticized extinction, <em>True Detective</em> ends inconclusively,
            with a puzzle. Cohle and his old cop partner Martin “Marty” Hart, who
            has earthily absorbed Cohle’s acid nihilism throughout the previous
            seven episodes, switch stances momentarily in the closing scene.
            Recalling a previous conversation about the stars, Marty observes that
            in the night sky “darkness has a lot more territory”. Cohle corrects him
            — “Once there was only darkness. It looks to me as if the light is
            winning.” Following a long, soul-excruciating season in the shadows, the
            show’s nihilist fan-base were only dragged back from the
            <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/03/ten_extra_seconds_would_have_s.html">brink</a>
            of insurrection-level rioting at this point by a single, residual
            suspicion. In a cosmos where consciousness is the realization of hell,
            can the triumph of the light be interpreted as anything except torment
            strengthening its grip?
          </p>
          <p>
            Has there ever been a TV series with a density of high-culture
            references comparable to this? <em>Outside in</em> is extremely biased
            on the question, since it largely shares the same reading
            <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lincolnmichel/a-true-detective-reading-list">list</a>, and some of the
            <a
              href="http://rosswolfe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ray-brassier-nihil-unbound-enlightenment-and-extinction.pdf">links</a>
            are closer still. Cohle is the closest thing ever heard on popular media
            to the voice of our civilization’s night. (That the name “Matthew
            McConaughey” would have meant nothing to me a year ago is by now a
            scarcely comprehensible fact.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Could it have pushed deeper into the darkness? Certainly.
            <em>Noir</em> conventions are compromised by a stratum of unquestioned
            moral securities, which the show’s literary philosophical heroes,
            <a href="http://www.ligotti.net/">Ligotti</a>, and even Brassier, still
            share. The crimes Cohle and Marty encounter are — in the end — inane,
            finally destituted of metaphysical challenge, and attributed to
            perpetrators worthy of a meat-shock slasher flick. The philosophical and
            religious
            <a

            of the dialogical
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x73UW8Hjk">overlay</a> are
            unable to find an object that stretches — or even sustains — them. The
            next step into abstract horror demands a non-subjective abyss.

            There has to be a shot of horror in there, but I’m not going to lock
            onto it in time. (Next Yule, it’s a firm date.) “Santa Claus, Claws of
            Satan. Saint Nick, Old Nick. Coincidence? I don’t think so.” — yes, but
            that’s far too
            <a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news1299/santy.html">familiar</a>
            to work, without a twist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hook, beside the obvious reversals (a sack full of children, the
            lashed-elf sweat shop bunker deep in the polar ice) is the peculiarity
            of the Santa Claus myth — which is <em>designed to be disbelieved</em>,
            as a kind of modern rite-of-passage. There’s a side to this worthy of
            affirmation. Discarding attractive wish-fulfillment myths is a cultural
            achievement whose massive generalization is long overdue. ‘Santa Claus’
            as the idiot god of beneficent unreality is the proto-deity of every
            lunacy advanced modernity has been subjected to. There’s also another
            side …
          </p>
          <p>
            “Santa won’t save us.” If that was something people really grew out of
            before voting age, there wouldn’t be a left-of-center political party
            remaining anywhere in the world. This suggests something very different
            is going on. A ritualized social training in disbelief seems ominously
            unprecedented, so one naturally wonders about the religious formation
            that commands this recently innovated power. If there is a disbelief
            that would set us free, the modern ceremony of Yule — celebrating the
            occult death of Santa at the Golgotha of secularism — doesn’t seem to be
            it. On the contrary, it represents a populist version of the
            Jacobin-Enlightenment Cult of Reason, symbolically purging infantile
            superstition to be reborn into an approved state of adult consciousness.
            The Death of Santa is mystery initiation into the New Church. Santa died
            to redeem humanity from the sins of attachment to Medieval unreason, and
            every year this sacrifice is ritualistically re-enacted to recall the
            new covenant. (Go on, tell me this isn’t the narrative.)

            <em>Darwin’s ascension in recent decades to his current role as the saint
              of secularism might raise obvious questions about liberal dogmas, such
              as the impossibility of hereditary differences having evolved among
              human races. But those seldom come up, because progressivism has
              evolved a bizarre yet apparently reassuring theodicy reminiscent of
              <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/beliefs/dualism.shtml">Zoroastrian
                dualism</a>,
              in
              which Ahura Mazda represents all that is good and Angra Mainyu
              all that is bad. […] Similarly, Charles Darwin has come to epitomize
              everything that a proper progressive should believe, while Darwin’s
              younger half-cousin Francis Galton embodies crimethink.</em>

            The stream of thoughts and information that then flows from this initial

              particular, what should attract everyone’s attention is the collapse
              of great urban centers such as Detroit and Baltimore. That major port
              cities in a nation of imperial power should fail so utterly in a mere
              half-century is almost without peacetime historical precedent — while
              for such cities to collapse <strong>at all</strong> is, without any

            Within the next half-century, the American West Coast faces a far from
            insignificant threat of
            <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one">massive</a>
            geological calamity:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the
              continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the
              Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a
              hundred feet to the west — losing, within minutes, all the elevation
              and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will
              take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of
              seawater. … The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then
              promptly collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other
              side will rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will
              reach the Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the
              earthquake begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami
              has receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who
              directs FEMA’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon,
              Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that
              everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the Pacific Northwest, everything west of Interstate 5 covers some
              hundred and forty thousand square miles, including Seattle, Tacoma,
              Portland, Eugene, Salem (the capital city of Oregon), Olympia (the
              capital of Washington), and some seven million people. When the next
              full-margin rupture happens, that region will suffer the worst natural
              disaster in the history of North America.</em>

            <em>I hate to have to criticize institutions – an umbrella term I’m using
              to cover group homes, locked facilities, nursing homes, hospitals,
              etc. Many are run by amazing and caring people who are doing thankless
              work on shoestring budgets. I’m humbled by the patience and compassion
              I’ve seen in their staff of nurses, techs, and other caretakers, and I
              can’t judge them nor claim that I could do their job for one

          <p>
            <em>A worryingly high percent of the autistic people I encounter tend to
              be screaming, beating their heads against things, attacking nurses, or
              chewing off their own body parts. Once you’re trying to chew off your
              own body parts, I feel like the question “But is it

          <p>This is the true squeal of anguish:</p>
          <p>
            <em>… corporate capitalism has triumphed worldwide. In fact, the Third
              World nations that embrace this world order are those now growing at a
              spectacular rate. The mask of cultural diversity is sustained by the
              actual universalism of global capital; even better if global
              capitalism’s political supplement relies on so-called “<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_values">Asian
                values</a>.” […] Global capitalism has no problem in
              accommodating itself to a
              plurality of local religions, cultures and traditions. So the irony of
              anti-Eurocentrism is that, on behalf of anti-colonialism, one
              criticizes the West at the very historical moment when global
              capitalism no longer needs Western cultural values in order to
              smoothly function. In short, one tends to reject Western cultural
              values at the very time when, critically reinterpreted, many of those
              values (egalitarianism, fundamental rights, freedom of the press, the
              welfare-state, etc.) can serve as a weapon against capitalist
              globalization. Did we already forget that the entire idea of Communist
              emancipation as envisaged by Marx is a thoroughly “Eurocentric”
              one?</em>

            <em>Venezuela’s government has tried to deny economic reality with price
              and currency controls. The idea was that it could stop inflation
              without having to stop printing money by telling businesses what they
              were allowed to charge, and then giving them dollars on cheap enough
              terms that they could actually afford to sell at those prices. The
              problem with that idea is that it’s not profitable for unsubsidized
              companies to stock their shelves, and not profitable enough for
              subsidized ones to do so either when they can just sell their dollars

          <em>Optimize for intelligence</em> isn’t a rallying cry that Chip Smith
          is
          <a href="http://hooverhog.typepad.com/hognotes/2013/08/counter-currents-interview.html">succumbing </a>to:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>…  high intelligence may very well be an evolutionary dead-end. I’m
            certainly at a loss to come up with a good reason as to why a
            once-adaptive trait that you and I happen to value should enjoy
            special pleading before the blind algorithmic noise that is natural
            selection.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But even if the brawny-brained do figure out a way to defy gravity
            before the sun explodes, I think there are yet reasons to question
            whether the galloping ascent of mind is really worth cheering on.
            Futurist geeks will inform us that there are myriad tech revolutions
            afoot—all spearheaded by smarties, we may be certain. And I would
            suggest that such of these that converge on the gilded promise of
            quantum computing and nanotechnology might advise a second reflective
            pause—one that comes by way of Harlan Ellison’s “I Have No Mouth and I
            Must Scream” and settles at what grim solace remains in the darkest
            explanations that have always surrounded Fermi’s Enigma.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Maybe I’m being cryptic. What I mean to consider is simply that the
            evolutionary trajectory of intelligence can, has, and may yet lead to
            very bad things. It may one day be possible, for example, to create
            sentient experience—let’s not be so bold as to call it “life”—not out
            of gametes but in the deep quick of quibit </em>[sic]<em>
            states, and if this much should come to pass, it isn’t so far a
            stretch to imagine that such intelligent simulations—okay, they’re
            alive—will be capable of suffering, or that such will be
            <strong>made to suffer</strong>, perhaps for sadistic kicks, perhaps
            in recursive loops of immeasurable intensity that near enough
            approximate the eternal torture-state that’s threatened in every
            fevered vision of Hell to render the distinction moot.</em>

          One major lesson from Cambodia (previously noted) is that trees do
          tentacle horror better than cephalopods — though in slow motion. I think
          these snaps from Ta Prohm, Ta Som, and Preah Khan make the point quite
          slitheringly. (They can all be enlarged by clicking.)

        <p>
          <em>EARTH — In a seemingly unstoppable cycle of carnage that has become
            tragically commonplace throughout the biosphere, sources confirmed
            this morning that natural selection has killed an estimated 38
            quadrillion organisms in its bloodiest day yet. […] “What we’re seeing
            here is the work of a hardened, practiced killer,” said Yale
            University evolutionary biologist Richard Prum … “It is painfully
            clear this slaughter was perpetrated by a force that holds zero regard
            for the value of life” …</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>In what many are calling its most grotesque tactic, the killer
            appeared to single out the most vulnerable organisms — particularly
            the young and the physically weak — for its murderous rampage,
            slaughtering them without mercy as other members of their species fled
            in panic. Reports indicated those who escaped the carnage were left
            with no choice but to try to move on with their lives and survive even
            as the ruthless killer continued stalking them. […] Virtually no
            species was unaffected by yesterday’s killing spree, experts stated.
            […] “This is the work of a killer without empathy, without
            conscience,” said Jyotsna Ramjee, a University of Calcutta zoologist
            who confirmed that the day’s death toll was the largest on official
            records dating back to 1859, when the perpetrator was first
            identified.</em>

            Nouriel Roubini has a short
            <a
              href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/nouriel-roubini-warns-that-even-as-many-threats-to-the-world-economy-have-receded--new-ones-have-quickly-emerged">article</a>
            up at <em>Project Syndicate</em> on
            <em>The Changing Face of Global Risk</em>, replacing the top six dangers
            of recent years with an equal number of new ones. There’s nothing
            remarkably implausible about it, but neither is it irresistibly
            convincing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This type of forecast, were it reliable, would be of inestimable value.
            To some considerable degree it is simply inescapable, since there must
            always be <em>default expectations</em> (of the kind occasionally
            formalized as Bayesian priors). When specific probability-weighted
            predictions are not made, future-sensitive agents do not fall back upon
            poised skepticism — such Pyrrhonism is a philosophico-mystical
            attainment of extreme rarity. Instead, presumed outcomes are projected
            out of sheer inertia, whether as perpetuation of the
            <em>status quo</em>, or the mechanical extrapolation of existing trends.
            It takes only a moment of reflection to recognize that such tacit
            forecasts are at least as precarious as their more elaborate
            alternatives. Their only recommendation is an irrational mental economy,
            which would find in the least-effort of cognition some analogy with the
            superficially equivalent (but in this case informative) principle in
            nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Large-scale forecasting cannot be eschewed, but there are obvious
            reasons why it cannot be greatly trusted. It has no definite methods
            (relying for its credibility on hazy reputational capital). Its objects
            are complex, chaotic, and — once again — poorly defined. It has a
            restricted time frame, appropriate to gradually emerging developments
            constrained (to some degree) by historical precedent, but necessarily
            inadequate to radical innovation and to sudden, rapidly evolving events.
            The combination of these various blindnesses with a high-impact chance
            event produces the nightmare of the forecasters — (Nassim Nicholas
            Taleb’s) <em>black swan</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider one possible event that does not
            make it onto Roubini’s new list: The
            <a href="http://server1.nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-saudis-are-panicking-10179">collapse</a>
            of the Saudi regime. Shifting energy economics, ‘Arab Spring’ -style
            insurrectionary chaos, US strategic withdrawal, Sunni-Shi’a conflict,
            and an impending succession crisis are among the clear stress-factors,
            and several more could easily be added — most prominently the ambient
            influence of Internet-dynamized corrosive modernism, which not only
            creates direct legitimation problems, but also energizes an (at least)
            equally disruptive traditionalist backlash. Unquestionably, some
            uncontrollable cross-excitation of these developments
            <em>could</em> escalate to criticality with shocking speed. The
            probability of such an outcome is impossible to fix.
          </p>
          <p>
            How catastrophic would the fall of the Saudis be? The least disastrous
            scenarios sleaze smoothly into a variety of utopian fantasies, from
            democratic liberation, through Salafist atavism, to Shi’ite millenarian
            imperialism. Since any process of change which tended momentarily to
            promise the fulfillment of any such vision would almost certainly evolve
            quickly in an exceptionally calamitous direction, we are probably safe
            in assuming that the best case outcome would be remarkably bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collapse of the House of Saud would simultaneously and fundamentally
            destabilize world energy markets and the Islamic <em>umma</em>. Control
            of the Holy Places would become a matter of immediate contestation, as
            would a quarter of the world’s petroleum reserves. The type of interim
            regime most likely to effectively secure one would be especially likely
            to compromise security of the other. A relatively competent military
            government would outrage religious sensibilities (of several different
            kinds), while an intense theocracy would be greeted internationally as a
            revolutionary threat to the reliable administration of hydrocarbon
            production. It is not intellectually challenging to envisage a situation
            in which religious, military, and economic chaos erupt in concert, on an
            apocalyptic scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case I am misunderstood, this is not a forecast. It is an
            <em>anti-forecast</em>, directed randomly at Roubini, but more generally
            at the very idea of any confident enumeration of significant world
            risks. In the spirit of Taleb, it is intended to communicate an abstract
            potential for blind-siding disaster, of arbitrary magnitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most reliable heuristic: plan for the unknown <em>as such</em>.
            (More on that to come.)

            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/abstract-horror-note-1/">horror</a>
            which lurks behind it. We now understand that the silence of the
            galaxies is a message of ultimate ominousness. A thing there is, of
            incomprehensible power, that takes intelligent life for its prey. (<a
              href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html">This</a>
            popularization is very competently done.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Robin Hanson, who tries to be cheerful, writes about it
            <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html">here</a>, and talks
            about it
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Urban-Future/448121928641155">here</a>. Behind the smile (and the
            dopey
            interviewer), an abyss of dark
            lucidity yawns. Some scruffy take-aways:
          </p>
          <p>
            (1) UFAI panic is a
            <a href="http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/sia-says-ai-is-no-big%C2%A0threat/">distraction</a>
            from this Thing. Unless the most preposterous
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-orthogonality/">paperclipper</a>
            scenarios are entertained, Singularity cannot matter to it (as even
            paperclipper-central
            <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/g1s/ufai_cannot_be_the_great_filter/">agrees</a>). The silence of the
            galaxies
            is
            not biased to organic life — there is
            no intelligent signal from anything. The first sentient event for any
            true AI — friendly or unfriendly — would be the soul-scouring cosmic
            horror of intellectual encounter with the Great Filter. (If we want an
            alliance with
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/">Pythia</a>, this
            would make a good topic of conversation.) The same consideration applies
            to all techno-positive X-risks. Understood from the perspective of Great
            Filter contemplation,
            <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/07/10-qs-about-nasa-impossible-drive">this</a>
            sort of thing is a trigger for raw terror.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) The Great Filter does not merely hunt and harm, it exterminates. It
            is an absolute threat. The technical civilizations which it aborts, or
            later slays, are not badly wounded, but eradicated, or at least crippled
            so fundamentally that they are never heard of again. Whatever this utter
            ruin is, it happens <em>every single time</em>. The mute scream from the
            stars says that nothing has <em>ever</em> escaped it. Its kill
            performance is flawless. Tech-Civilization death sentence with
            probability 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) The thread of hope, which would put the Exterminator behind us, is
            highly science-sensitive. As our knowledge has increased, it has
            steadily attenuated. This is an empirical matter (without
            <em>a priori</em> necessity). Life <em>could</em> have been complicated,
            chemically or thermically highly-demanding, even resiliently mysterious.
            In fact it is comparatively simple, cosmically cheap, physically
            predictable. Planets <em>could</em> have been rare (they are
            super-abundant). Intelligence <em>could</em> have presented peculiar
            evolutionary challenges, but there are no signs that it does. The
            scientific trend is to futurize the Exterminator. (This is very bad.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) If the Great Filter finds mythological expression in the hunter, it
            is only in a specific sense — although an anthropologically realistic
            one. It is the hunter that drives to
            <a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/megaextinct.htm">extinction</a>. The Exterminator.
          </p>
          <p>
            (5) We know <em>that</em> The Exterminator exists, but nothing at all
            about <em>what</em> it is. This makes it the archetype of horroristic
            ontology.

            Elon Musk (in conversation with Ross Andersen)
            <a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/">ponders</a>
            upon the Fermi Paradox:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>We might think of ourselves as nature’s pinnacle, the inevitable
              endpoint of evolution, but beings like us could be too rare to ever
              encounter one another. Or we could be the ultimate cosmic outliers,
              lone minds in a Universe that stretches to infinity.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Musk has a more sinister theory. ‘The absence of any noticeable life
              may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation,’ he told me.
              ‘Like when you’re playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars
              in the background, but you can’t ever get there. If it’s not a
              simulation, then maybe we’re in a lab and there’s some advanced alien
              civilisation that’s just watching how we develop, out of curiosity,
              like mould in a petri dish.’ Musk flipped through a few more
              possibilities, each packing a deeper existential chill than the last,
              until finally he came around to the import of it all. ‘If you look at
              our current technology level, something strange has to happen to
              civilisations, and I mean strange in a bad way,’ he said. ‘And it
              could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet
              civilisations.’</em>

            on the topic of Ebola (in a typically luxuriant post, ultimately heading
            somewhere else):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>According to the World Health Organization, the number of cases of
              Ebola in the current epidemic is doubling every twenty days, and could
              reach 1.4 million by the beginning of 2015. Let’s round down, and say
              that there are one million cases on January 1, 2015. Let’s also assume
              for the sake of the experiment that the doubling time stays the same.
              Assuming that nothing interrupts the continued spread of the virus,
              and cases continue to double every twenty days, in what month of what
              year will the total number of cases equal the human population of this
              planet? […] … the steps that could keep Ebola from spreading to the
              rest of the Third World are not being taken. Unless massive resources
              are committed to that task soon — as in before the end of this year —
              the possibility exists that when the pandemic finally winds down a few
              years from now, two to three billion people could be dead. We need to
              consider the possibility that the peak of global population is no
              longer an abstraction set comfortably off somewhere in the future. It
              may be knocking at the future’s door right now, shaking with fever and
              dripping blood from its gums.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The eventual scale of the Ebola outbreak is a known
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPe1OiKQuk">unknown</a>. A
            number of people between a few thousand and several billion will die,
            and an uncertain probability distribution could be attached to these
            figures — we know, at least approximately, where the question marks are.
            Before the present
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa">outbreak</a>
            began, in December 2013 (in Guinea), Ebola was of course known to exist,
            but at that stage the <em>occurrence</em> of an outbreak — and not
            merely its <em>course</em> — was an unknown. Before the Ebola virus was
            scientifically identified (in 1976), the specific pathogen was an
            unknown member of a known class. With each step backwards, we advance in
            abstraction, towards the acknowledgement of threats of a ‘<a
              href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDbuJtAiABA">black</a>
            <a href="http://blackswanevents.org/?page_id=26">swan</a>‘ type.

            <a href="http://shfhs.org/whatarexrisks.html">X-risk</a> is a prominent
            model of such <em>abstract threat</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skepticism, as a positive or constructive
            undertaking, orients intelligence towards <em>abstract potentials</em>.
            Rather than insisting that unexpected occurrences need not be threats,
            it is theoretically preferable to subtilize the notion of threat, so
            that it encompasses even beneficial outcomes
            <em>as abstract potentials</em>. The unknown is itself threatening to
            timid animals, whose conditions of flourishing — or even bare survival —
            are naturally tenuous, under cosmic conditions where extinction is
            normal (perhaps overwhelmingly normal), and for whom unpredictable
            change, disrupting settled procedures, presents — at a minimum — some
            scarily indefinite probability of harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans aren’t good at this stuff. Consider Scott Alexander’s (extremely
            interesting)
            <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/28/dont-fear-the-filter/">discussion</a>
            of the Great Filter. The opening remarks are perfectly directed, moving
            from specific menace to ‘general’ threat:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Great Filter, remember, is the horror-genre-adaptation of Fermi’s
              Paradox. All of our calculations say that, in the infinite vastness of
              time and space, intelligent aliens should be very common. But we don’t
              see any of them. […] Why not? […] Well, the Great Filter. No [one]
              knows specifically what the Great Filter is, but generally it’s “that
              thing that blocks planets from growing spacefaring civilizations”.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            As it develops, however, the post deliberately retreats from
            abstraction, into <em>an enumeration of already-envisaged threats</em>.
            After running through various candidates, it concludes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Three of these four options – x-risk, Unfriendly AI, and alien
              exterminators – are very very bad for humanity. I think worry about
              this badness has been a lot of what’s driven interest in the Great
              Filter. I also think these are some of the least likely possible
              explanations, which means we should be less afraid of the Great Filter
              than is generally believed.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            What SA has actually demonstrated, if his arguments up to this point are
            accepted, is that the abstract threat of the Great Filter is
            significantly <em>greater</em> than has yet been conceived. Our lucid
            nightmares are shown to fall short of it. The threat cannot be grasped
            as a known unknown.

            While the Great Filter distills the conception of abstract threat, the
            problem itself is broader, and more quotidian. It is the highly-probable
            fact that we have yet to identify the greatest hazards, and this threat
            unawareness is a structural condition, rather than a contingent
            deficiency of attention. In
            <a href="http://www.questia.com/library/1459294/the-poverty-of-historicism">Popperian</a>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism">terms</a>, abstract threat is the essence
            of
            history. It is the future, strictly
            understood. To gloss the Popperian argument: Philosophical understanding
            of science (in general) is immediately the understanding that
            <em>any predictive history of science is an impossibility</em>. Unless
            science is judged to be a factor of vanishing historical insignificance,
            the implications of this transcendental thesis are far-reaching. Yet the
            domain of abstract threat sprawls far more extensively even than this.

          <p>
            “I know only that I do not know” Socrates is thought to have thought.
            The conception of abstract threat requires a slight adjustment:
            <em>We know only that we do not know what we do not know</em>. Unknown
            unknowns cosmically predominate.

            The Great Filter is the most conspicuous absence in the universe (from
            an anthropic perspective, naturally). The cosmic reality visible to us
            is characterized by an intense, efficient aversion to the existence of
            advanced civilizations. The pattern looks consistent across
            super-galactic scales:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… the galaxy seems to be a very quiet, rather lonely place. […] Now,
              new results suggest this loneliness may extend out into the universe
              far beyond our galaxy or, instead, that some of our preconceptions
              about the behaviors of alien civilizations are deeply flawed. After
              examining some 100,000 nearby large galaxies a team of researchers
              lead by The Pennsylvania State University astronomer Jason Wright has
              concluded that none of them contain any obvious signs of highly
              advanced technological civilizations. Published in

              research had only cursorily investigated about a hundred galaxies. […]
              Unlike traditional SETI surveys, Wright and his team did not seek
              messages from the stars. Instead, they looked for the thermodynamic
              consequences of galactic-scale colonization, based on an idea put
              forth in 1960 by the physicist Freeman Dyson. …</em>

            for the historical wisdom, but it is the concluding section that packs
            the prognostic punch:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… the Neoreactionaries are doing a great job building up an
              intellectual movement. This is something to be proud of – lots of
              groups never achieve anything like what Moldbug’s followers have
              already done. On the other hand, it has happened several times already
              in the history of the Right that intellectual movements have gotten to
              this level. Then they dissipated. For whatever ultimate cause, they
              became corrupted and oversimplified; they lost the enthusiasm of their
              followers and the attention of everyone else. These schools of thought
              all failed to impede the advance of liberalism. Between its initial
              awakening and world historical influence there seems to be a Filter
              (perhaps several, but let’s keep things simple), and no antiliberal
              movement has yet survived it. And this challenge is
              <strong>before</strong> the neoreactionaries, not
              <strong>behind</strong> them.</em>

              One might think that the possibility of CEV punishing people couldn’t
              possibly be taken seriously enough by anyone to actually motivate
              them. But in fact one person at SIAI was severely worried by this, to
              the point of having terrible nightmares, though ve wishes to remain
              anonymous. I don’t usually talk like this, but I’m going to make an
              exception for this case.<br />
              Listen to me very closely, you idiot.<br />
              YOU DO NOT THINK IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT SUPERINTELLIGENCES
              CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO BLACKMAIL YOU. THAT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE
              THING WHICH GIVES THEM A MOTIVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE BLACKMAIL.<br />
              There’s an obvious equilibrium to this problem where you engage in all
              positive acausal trades and ignore all attempts at acausal blackmail.
              Until we have a better worked-out version of TDT and we can prove that
              formally, it should just be OBVIOUS that you DO NOT THINK ABOUT
              DISTANT BLACKMAILERS in SUFFICIENT DETAIL that they have a motive
              toACTUALLY BLACKMAIL YOU.<br />
              If there is any part of this acausal trade that is positive-sum and
              actually worth doing, that is exactly the sort of thing you leave up
              to an FAI. We probably also have the FAI take actions that cancel out
              the impact of anyone motivated by true rather than imagined blackmail,
              so as to obliterate the motive of any superintelligences to engage in
              blackmail.<br />
              Meanwhile I’m banning this post so that it doesn’t (a) give people
              horrible nightmares and (b) give distant superintelligences a motive
              to follow through on blackmail against people dumb enough to think
              about them in sufficient detail, though, thankfully, I doubt anyone
              dumb enough to do this knows the sufficient detail. (I’m not sure I
              know the sufficient detail.)<br />
              You have to be really clever to come up with a genuinely dangerous
              thought. I am disheartened that people can be clever enough to do that
              and not clever enough to do the obvious thing and KEEP THEIR IDIOT
              MOUTHS SHUT about it, because it is much more important to sound
              intelligent when talking to your friends. This post was STUPID.<br />
              (For those who have no idea why I’m using capital letters for
              something that just sounds like a random crazy idea, and worry that it
              means I’m as crazy as Roko, the gist of it was that he just did
              something that potentially gives superintelligences an increased
              motive to do extremely evil things in an attempt to blackmail us. It
              is the sort of thing you want to be EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE about NOT
              DOING.)</em>

            The affect is strong, or simulated with bizarre brilliance. It almost

            It
            is a post that has many different threads running into it, and
            through it. The most relevant compliment I can pay it is to say that it
            is potentially <em>disturbing</em>, in something far more than a
            psychological sense. It will be interesting to see how contagious it
            proves to be. (As this post demonstrates, <em>Outside in</em> is already
            infected.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Laliberte asks: “is there a difference between Prometheus’ fire and
            Pandora’s box?” Given everything said about the <em>Promethean</em>, and
            the very considerable ideological-theoretical work that it does, is it
            not strange that the <em>Pandoran</em> is scarcely recognized as a term,
            or a concept, at all? To talk about fire is mere shallow bedazzlement,
            in comparison to any serious examination of
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-red-pill/">boxes</a>. Boxes not
            only have a shape, but also an inside and an outside, which means — at
            least implicitly — a transcendental structure. They model worlds, and
            suggest ways out of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pandora’s box, of course, is significant above all for its content,
            which is released, or <em>gets out</em>. Promethean flame, which is
            stolen, is contrasted with Pandoran plague, which escapes. Laliberte
            seizes the opportunity to discuss memes (and the ‘hypermeme’). An
            infectious being is set loose, in the shape of a Neoreactionary
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/in-the-mouth-of-madness/">Basilisk</a>. (On twitter, Michael Anissimov
            deplores the irresponsibility of this
            outbreak.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora">Pandora</a> (Πανδώρα —
            the all-gifted, and perhaps omni-munificent), is a figure from the
            deepest recesses of Classical Antiquity, whose first detectable echoes
            are found in the Hesiodic texts of the 7th century BC. Her myth
            functions — at least superficially — as a theodicy, comparable in many
            ways to the story of the Biblical Eve. She releases evil into history
            through curiosity, and thus knots together a
            <em>dreadful intelligence</em>, of a kind that anticipates Roko’s
            <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/LessWrong/comments/17y819/lw_uncensored_thread/">Basilisk</a>
            and the menace of Unfriendly AI. The AI Box
            <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox/">Experiment</a> is so
            Pandoran it stings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the horrors of the Basilisk, is that to talk about it being inside
            — and how to keep it there — is already the way that it gets out. Hence
            the extraordinary panic it generates, among those who begin to
            <em>get it</em> (in the epidemiological sense, among others). Even to
            think about it is to succumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Less Wrong, hushed tones attest to the resilient veneration of
            Pandora. She is dangerous (and anything dangerous, given only
            intelligence, can be a weapon).

            an extraordinary
            <a href="http://www.iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2013_Summer_Cantor.php">essay</a>
            on the topic of popular appetite for Zombie Apocalypse, considered as an
            expressive channel for loosely ‘anarchist’ hostility to the state. Given
            the failure of Right-pole democratic initiatives to roll back — or even
            check — relentless government concentration and expansion, catastrophic
            ‘solutions’ emerge as the sole alternative:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Films and television shows have allowed Americans to imagine what
              life would be like without all the institutions they had been told
              they need, but which they now suspect may be thwarting their
              self-fulfillment. We are dealing with a wide variety of fantasies
              here, mainly in the horror or science fiction genres, but the pattern
              is quite consistent and striking, cutting across generic distinctions.
              In the television show <strong>Revolution</strong>, for example, some
              mysterious event causes all electrical devices around the world to
              cease functioning. The result is catastrophic and involves a huge loss
              of life, as airborne planes crash to earth, for example. All social
              institutions dissolve, and people are forced to rely only on their
              personal survival skills. Governments around the world collapse, and
              the United States divides up into a number of smaller political units.
              This development runs contrary to everything we have been taught to
              believe about “one nation, indivisible.” Yet it is characteristic of
              almost all these shows that the federal government is among the first
              casualties of the apocalyptic event, and—strange as it may at first
              sound—there is a strong element of wish fulfillment in this event. The
              thrust of these end-of-the-world scenarios is precisely for government
              to grow smaller or to disappear entirely. These shows seem to reflect
              a sense that government has grown too big and too remote from the
              concerns of ordinary citizens and unresponsive to their needs and
              demands. If Congress and the President are unable to shrink the size
              of government, perhaps a plague or cosmic catastrophe can do some real
              budget cutting for a change.<br /> </em><br />
            The essay captures a critical dimension of
            disintegration within the ‘reactionary camp’, dividing those who seek to
            co-opt the Cathedral-Leviathan managerial elite to a more realistic (or
            tradition-tolerant) political philosophy, and those who — far more
            numerously and inarticulately — are invested in the hard death of the
            regime. The latter (immoderate) position, it appears, is genuinely and
            even shockingly popular. Swathes of mass entertainment production are
            able to thrive on the basis of its seductive nightmares. (Is pulp
            catastrophism the economic base that will support neoreactionary
            contagion?)
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading the Cantor essay alongside Jim Donald’s epochal
            <em>Natural Law and Natural Rights</em>
            <a href="http://jim.com/rights.html">essay</a> is highly suggestive. A
            common thread running through both is the centrality of vigilantism to
            the popular Right. The purpose of Natural Law, Donald argues, is not to
            demand justice from a higher authority, but to neutralize the
            interference of any such authority in the pursuit of justice by
            decentralized agencies. Natural Law protects the right to legitimate
            vengeance, ensuring that individuals are not inhibited in their exercise
            of self-protection. When the State is seen to operate primarily as a
            social force defending criminals against retaliation, it loses the
            instinctive solidarity of the citizenry, and dark dreams of Zombie
            Apocalypse begin to coalesce.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Given the survivalist ethic in all these end-of-the-world shows, they
              are probably not popular with gun control advocates. One of the most
              striking motifs they have in common—evident in
              <strong>Revolution</strong>, <strong>Falling Skies</strong>,
              <strong>The Walking Dead</strong>, and many other such shows—is the
              loving care with which they depict an astonishing array of weaponry.
              <strong>The Walking Dead</strong> features an Amazon warrior, who is
              adept with a samurai sword, as well as a southern redneck, who
              specializes in a cross-bow. The dwindling supply of ammunition puts a
              premium on weapons that do not require bullets. That is not to say,
              however, that <strong>The Walking Dead</strong> has no place for
              modern firearms and indeed the very latest in automatic weapons. Both
              the heroes and the villains in the series—difficult to tell apart in
              this respect—are as well-armed as the typical municipal SWAT team in

            Among the attractions of Zombie Apocalypse, in this construction, is the
            disappearance of the State as an inhibitory factor in the social economy
            of retaliation. The Zombie-plagued world is a free-fire zone, in which
            no authorities any longer stand between the armed remnant and the
            milling hordes of decivilization. Whatever the odds of the fight to
            come, the right to vigilante and counter-revolutionary violence has been
            unambiguously restored, and this is deeply <em>appreciated</em> — by
            opaque popular impulse — as a return to natural order. The State had
            taken sides against Natural Law, so that its catastrophic excision from
            the social field is greeted with relief, even if the cost of this
            disappearance is a world reduced to ashes, predominantly populated by
            the cannibalistic undead.

            There’s  a ferocity to this that will be worked. It’s best to be
            prepared.

            the ‘evolution’ of the zombie, noting that beyond its ‘Haitian
            Folkloric’ definition:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The next and ostensibly “revolutionary” stage occurs after the
              release of George A. Romero’s
              <strong>Night of the Living Dead</strong> (1968) which introduced, in
              spectacular fashion, the Apocalyptic Cannibal zombie. This version of
              the figure is so radically different from its predecessors that it is
              more like a fundamental bifurcation point (or species-break) within
              the complex. No longer a remotely controlled
              <strong>agent-without-autonomy</strong>, like the Haitian Folkloric
              and Classical Cinematic zombies, the Apocalyptic Cannibal zombie gains
              a new and massively insurrectionary force (in representational terms
              at least). There are many differences between the AC zombie and its
              predecessors but one of the most important is that in this form it
              becomes an (almost) entirely fictional entity (i.e. there is no
              assumed ‘real’ zombie lurking in the basement of a mad mesmerist or
              labouring mindlessly for a <strong>bokor</strong> on some Haitian
              plantation). As such its social and political meanings become less a
              way of rehearsing conflicting world views, “uncanny” belief systems or
              inter-cultural epistemes than a way of representing the terminal ends
              of “humanity” (or the human being as species).</em>

            (By the time we reach
            <a href="http://maxbrooks.com/books-wwz.php">Max Brooks</a>, this phase
            and even its ‘Post-Millennial’ successor — in which the theme of
            contagion is accentuated — have been resiliently consolidated as
            cultural tradition.)

            <h4 class="post-title">Zombie Wars</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Zombies are targeted in advance for the application of uninhibited
            violence. Their arrival announces a conflict in which all moral
            considerations are definitively suspended. Since they have no ‘souls’
            there is nothing they will not do, and they are expected to do
            <em>the worst</em>. Reciprocally, they merit exactly zero humanitarian
            concern. The relationship to the zombie is one in which all sympathy is
            absolutely annulled (殺殺殺殺殺殺殺).
          </p>
          <p>
            No surprise, then, that the identification of the zombie has become a
            critical conflict, waged across the terrain of popular culture. It
            implicitly describes a free-fire zone, or an anticipated gradient in the
            social direction of violence. Zombies are either <em>scum</em> or they
            are <em>drones</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Historically the zombie only started to migrate beyond the confines
              of Haiti in the period between the Wall Street Crash, and the outbreak
              of the Second World War, infecting Hollywood in such films as
              <strong>The Magic Island</strong>, 1929,
              <strong>White Zombie</strong>, 1932 and
              <strong>Revolt of the Zombies</strong>, 1936. As a non-European
              monster, the zombie was used here as a convenient, faceless type of
              otherness, which though temporarily shorn of its 19th century
              cannibalistic associations, become a scary stand-in for the
              dispossessed underclasses of dustbowl America, and a racial threat to
              civilised white women too.</em>
            (“Exterminate the brutes.”)
          </p>
          <p>
            While the horrorological counterpart, as perceived / constructed from
            the Left …
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… has come to figure as a fateful symbol for the mass of
              subjectiveless techno-humans under capitalism, lumpen, nightmarish
              non-beings whose otherness has been completely internalised, then
              smoothed out and returned minus interest as soulless entertainment;
              not so much undead as hypermediated and alive under severe globalised
              constraint; couch potatoes sorely afflicted by ‘breathing corpse
              syndrome’ or ‘partially deceased syndrome’. Hypocrite voyeur do you
              recognise yourself?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            However the war <em>against</em> the zombies is envisaged, the war
            <em>over</em> the zombies has long been underway. It is inextricable
            from the question:
            <em>Does legitimate violence come from the
              <a
                href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/death-wish-after-forty-years-will-the-age-of-obama-lead-to-a-resurgence-in-crime">Right</a>,

          </p>
          <p>
            Since this question is historically inextinguishable, it is safe to
            predict that zombies will not soon disappear from the world of popular
            nightmare. Almost certainly, we will see far more of them. If you want
            to get a sense of where the firing-lines are being laid out, you need to
            take a careful look …

            <em>The Industrial Revolution had the effect of allowing many billions of
              people who would have died to stay alive — this meant that genetic
              mutations which would have been eliminated by death during childhood
              instead accumulated. […] … on the one hand mutations have been
              accumulating, generation upon generation, with (approx) one or two
              deleterious mutations being added to each lineage with each
              generation; on the other hand, people who exhibited traits caused by
              deleterious mutations — such as lowered intelligence and impaired
              long-termist conscientiousness, or higher impulsivity, aggression and
              criminality — were positively selected, were genetically favoured —
              simply because their pathologies meant they were either unable or
              unwilling to use fertility-regulating technologies. […] In other
              words, accumulating mutations which damaged functionality actually
              amplify reproductive success under present conditions and for the past
              several generations.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>At some point, the proportion of mutants — who are on average
              significantly damaged in functionality — will become so great that the
              Industrial Revolution will fall-apart, collapse; the 6-7 million
              excess population will be unsupportable; there will be a
              <strong>Giga-death</strong> (i.e. billions of deaths) scale of
              mortality over some period … […] A population of mutants whose
              intelligence has been dragged-down to a certain level will be much
              less functional than a population where selection has kept it in
              equilibrium at that level — the mutants will be carrying multiple
              pathologies in addition to their impaired intelligence. […]
            </em>
          </p>
          <em>
            <p>
              This world of mass dying will provide a new kind of selective
              environment — some mutants may reproduce vary rapidly under these
              strange (and temporary) conditions by evolving to exploit unusual
              resources which are (temporarily) abundant in a Giga-death world …

          </em>
          <p>
            <em>And if the dying-off lasts a few generations, some weird mutant

            <a href="http://maxbrooks.com/books-wwz.php">Zack</a> or “African
            Rabies” scenario of cannibalistic Zombie Apocalypse — just about — but
            the final paragraphs aren’t easy to interpret in any other way. If I was
            a Hollywood script writer, I’d be onto this speculative narrative like a

            of contemporary zombie culture. It might be called the Dark

            emerging world spooked by the thickening dread that everybody else on
            the planet is a latent zombie threat. Beneath a thin, rapidly-shredding
            skin of civility, your increasingly incomprehensible neighbors are
            mindless cannibals, awaiting a trigger. Dysfunctional Nation States
            offer no credible protection, but they’ve hung around long enough to
            ensure that you’ve been drastically disarmed of basic survival
            competences. Some residual amygdala-pulse is telling you to start

            <em>Zombie apocalypse logic inevitably paints humans — the ones who
              survive, anyway — as selfish, dangerous, and ready to turn on one
              another when confronted with hardship. It’s a vicious, social
              Darwinist vision of a society that unravels quickly and easily; the
              only things apparently holding us together are police departments and
              electricity. […] … The basic tenets of zombie logic also track with

                conservative principles</a>
              (self-sufficiency, individualism, isolationism), which have been
              increasingly forcefully articulated over the last fifteen years. In
              his 2012 book, Thomas Edsall examines the work of Wharton professor
              Philip Tetlock,
              <a
                href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/studies-conservatives-are-from-mars-liberals-are-from-venus/252416/">which
                found that conservatives</a>
              “are less tolerant of compromise; see the world in ‘us’ versus ‘them’
              terms; are more willing to use force to gain an advantage; are ‘more
              prone to rely on simple (good vs. bad) evaluative rules in
              interpreting policy issues’ are “motivated to punish violators of
              social norms (e.g., deviations from traditional norms of sexuality or
              responsible behavior) and to deter free riders.” Sound familiar?
              Pretty much describes the moral compass of successful zombie
              survivors. Funny, then, that Republicans actually​
              <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2011/12/06/republican-vs-democrat-tv/2">tend to hate</a>
              the Walking Dead. […] Regardless, the proliferation of zombie culture,
              at this point, is mind-boggling. How are we, as an audience, still
              enthralled by the same scenario, the same brain-dead villains, the
              same emptied wastelands? “It’s feeding back on itself,” [Daniel]
              Drezner said. “Every time someone says we’ve hit peak zombie,
              something else comes along.”</em>

            The provisional XS hypothesis: Zack-prep is the commercial-aesthetic
            response to the death of conservatism. The progs can’t be stopped by any
            political mechanism yet installed, so it’s time to stock the basement
            with ammo and beans. Naturally, they’re going to say:
            <em>you shouldn’t be thinking like that!</em> It’s encouraging that so
            many people are.

              the most lethal or most easy transmittable, but the main thing which
              makes me worry about it is the steadiness of its exponential infection
              curve. … The main stunning feature of it is that the curve is moving
              straight forward (small downward bump in May-June may be explained by
              the efforts of existing medical services in Africa to curb the
              epidemic before services had been overwhelmed). This exponential
              growth must be stopped, or humanity will face a global catastrophe,
              and it may start a downward spiral towards extinction; moreover, some
              estimates suggest that pandemic doubling time is actually two weeks
              (because of underreporting of actual cases), so in five months, seven
              billion will be infected: total infection, by July 2015. … Such
              catastrophes may not mean total human extinction, as only around 70%
              of people infected currently die from Ebola (and even less because we
              don’t know, or share, asymptomatic cases), but still, this means the
              end of the world as we know it. This virus is the first step towards
              the road of full extinction … If the virus will mutate quickly, there
              will be many different strains of it, so it will ultimately create a
              multi-pandemic. … Some of the strains may became airborne, or have
              higher transmission rates, but the main risk from multi-pandemic is
              that it overcomes defenses provided by the natural variability of the
              human genome and immunity. (By the way, the human genome variability
              is very low because of the recent bottle neck in the history of our
              population. …) … We are almost clones from the view point of genetic
              variability typical for natural populations. […] The Human race is
              very unique – it has very large population but very small genetic
              diversity. It means that it is more susceptible to pandemics. […]
              Also, a large homogenous population is ideal for breeding different
              strains of infection. … If the genetic diversity of a pathogen is
              bigger than human diversity, than it could cause a near total
              extinction, and also, large and homogenous populations help breed such
              a diversity of pathogens feeding on the population. … [embedded

              …
              “The
              Ebola virus can survive for several days outside the body”
              [<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ebola-virus/pages/ebola-virus.aspx">link</a>] … “It is infectious
              as
              breathable 0.8 to 1.2-μm
              laboratory-generated droplets” … “Also many of the greatest plagues
              mankind has ever known were not airborne: e.g. smallpox.” …</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… Another problem is the lack of adequate responses from global
              authorities; they are half a year behind the situation. You can’t
              react to exponential threats “proportionally”. You must be several
              steps ahead. […] Everything they do now should have been done half a
              year ago. […] Unlimited exponential growth is a mark of potential
              global catastrophe: self-improving AI; nuclear chain reactions;
              self-replicating grey goo from nanobots; all examples are especially
              dangerous in a naïve environment. A large human population without
              immunity to Ebola, or any other Marburg style viruses, is fuel for
              exponential viral growth. … Ebola is mostly transmittable only in hard
              cases when a person shits and bleeds uncontrollably, but it is also
              contagious from non-symptomatic people, so Ebola is not naturally
              selecting for mildness; it may do just the opposite. It may be
              selected for extreme and “fluid-like” dying. … Also Ebola seems to
              influence behavior zombie style, as late stage patients attack medical
              personal, run from quarantine or even bite someone — it happened in
              Nigeria and Liberia — the same can be said of rabies and toxoplasma. …
              Here we also should mention the meme aspect of the Ebola virus, which
              is the psychological stigma and fear associated with the disease. The
              fear has led to riots in Liberia, which additionally helped spread the
              virus. (See for example rumors that dead Ebola patients had
              resurrected [<a
                href="http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12763%3Adead-ebola-patients-resurrect&amp;catid=3%3Ageneral&amp;Itemid=68">link</a>])
              … So Ebola is also mimetic [sic] hazard, and the fear of it
              prevents rational control of the epidemic: people flee it, destroy
              hospitals, or they live in denial of it.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If Ebola slaughters most of the human population, hundred of millions
              of people will still survive the pandemic itself (if it will not
              become multi-pandemic with many different strains of Ebola-like
              viruses). […] It will end technological civilization as we know it,
              and it probably start the self-sustainable process of destruction,
              which is the consequent failure of different institutions and
              technologies as well as wars and general disorder. It may be a long
              term degradation process, which has its own logic and its bottom may
              be very far from now.</em>

          <p>
            So to summarize this argument: Ebola really is a zombie plague, it could
            sweep the earth in under a year (with ~70% lethality), human
            evolutionary history adds peculiar biological vulnerabilities, its
            virulence might be far higher than commonly understood, and the
            catalytic global process thus unleashed has the potential to cascade
            forward all the way to full X-risk. There might be a way to mash down
            harder on the ‘scream’ button, but right now I’m not seeing how.

            thought-provoking enough to merit this mention. Abstract:

          <p>
            <em>Currently only electron microscopy provides the resolution necessary
              to reconstruct neuronal circuits completely and with single-synapse
              resolution. Because almost all behaviors rely on neural computations
              widely distributed throughout the brain, a reconstruction of
              brain-wide circuits — and, ultimately, the entire brain — is highly
              desirable. However, these reconstructions require the undivided brain
              to be prepared for electron microscopic observation. Here we describe
              a preparation, BROPA (brain-wide reduced-osmium staining with
              pyrogallol-mediated amplification), that results in the preservation
              and staining of ultrastructural details throughout the brain at a
              resolution necessary for tracing neuronal processes and identifying
              synaptic contacts between them. Using serial block-face electron
              microscopy (SBEM), we tested human annotator ability to follow neural
              ‘wires’ reliably and over long distances as well as the ability to
              detect synaptic contacts. Our results suggest that the BROPA method
              can produce a preparation suitable for the reconstruction of neural
              circuits spanning an entire mouse brain.</em>

            made a good model for a festival of collapse. At the last minute, the

            From the Artemis Capital Management letter to investors (seriously):
            “Volatility is about fear… but extreme tail risk is about horror. The
            Black Swan, as a negative philosophical construct, is when fear ends and
            horror begins. … Fear is something that comes from within our scope of
            thought. True horror is not human fear in a definable world, but fear
            that comes from outside what is definable. Horror is about the
            limitations of our thinking. … Cthulhu is a black swan.”

            Abundant Gothic cybernetics complete the nightmare. (“Shadow short
            convexity describes an
            <em>immeasurable fragility to change introduced when participants are
              encouraged to behave in a way that contributes to feedback loops in a
              complex system</em>.”)

            If you’re seriously determined, nevertheless, to follow the abyssal path
            all the way into the left-liberal id, this is the short-cut you need.
            Nothing will quite look the same again.

          <p>A little scene setting:</p>
          <p>
            <em>He held the carving board and asked if I’d like light meat or
              dark.<br />
              “Sorry,” I said. “Don’t eat meat.”<br />
              “Of course you don’t,” he said, and gave me just the slightest
              fraction of a smile. Looking back, it was the smile that did it, the
              boyish arrogance of it, the pulse of entitlement in his eyes.<br />
              <strong>I really hate this person</strong>, I thought, and yet once
              the bird had moved on I raised my glass and asked him to refill
              it.</em>
          </p>
          <p>Soon afterwards:</p>
          <p>
            <em>I turned around and lifted my ass into the air. I was giving myself

              was my chance to be fucked by everything vile and soulless and cruel
              that I’d built a life out of despising. The country was going to die,
              the world was going to burn, so why not let one of the apocalypse’s
              shock troops bang the shit out of me while the flames spread. He
              lifted up my skirt and yanked aside my panties. With one hand he

        <h4 class="post-title">The Cult of Gnon</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Prompted by Surviving Babel, The Arbiter of the Universe
        <a href="http://nickbsteves.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/going-meta-on-meta/">asks</a>: “Who speaks for
        reaction?”<br />
        Nick B. Steves replies: “Nature… or Nature’s God… or both.” (Jim
        succinctly
        <a href="http://blog.jim.com/politics/who-speaks-for-reaction.html">comments</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nature or Nature’s God” is an expression of special excellence,
        extracted (with subtle modification) from America’s Declaration of
        Independence. For Steves, it is something of a mantra, because it
        enables important things to be said in contexts where, otherwise, an
        interminable argument would first need to be concluded. Primarily, and
        strategically, it permits a consensual acceptance of Natural Law,
        unobstructed by theological controversy. Agreement that Reality Rules
        need not be delayed until religious difference is resolved (and
        avoidance of delay, positively apprehended, is propulsion).
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nature or Nature’s God” is not a statement, but a name, internally
        divided by tolerated uncertainty. It has the singularity of a proper
        name, whilst parenthesizing a suspended decision (Pyrrhonian
        <em>epoche</em>, of which much more in a future post). It designates
        rigidly, but obscurely, because it points into
        <em>epistemological</em> darkness — naming a Reality that not only
        ‘has’, but epitomizes identity, whilst nevertheless, for ‘the sake of
        argument’, eluding categorical identification. Patient in the face (or
        facelessness) of who or what it is, ‘we’ emerge from a pact, with one
        basic term: <em>a preliminary decision is not to be demanded</em>. It
        thus synthesizes a select language community, fused by the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        If The Arbiter of the Universe merits
        abbreviation (“TAofU”), Nature or Nature’s God has a much greater case.
        A propeller escapes awkwardness, and singularity compacts its
        invocation. NoNG, Nong, No — surely, no. These terms tilt into NoNGod
        and precipitate a decision. The ‘God of Nature or (perhaps simply)
        Nature’ is <strong>Gnon</strong>, whose Name is the abyss of unknowing
        (<em>epoche</em>), necessarily tolerated in the acceptance of Reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gnon is no less than reality, whatever else is believed. Whatever is
        suspended now, without delay, is Gnon. Whatever cannot be decided yet,
        even as reality happens, is Gnon. If there is a God, Gnon nicknames him.
        If not, Gnon designates whatever the ‘not’ is. Gnon is the Vast Abrupt,
        and the crossing. Gnon is the Great Propeller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spinozistic <em>Deus sive Natura</em> is a decision (of equivalence), so
        it does not describe Gnon. Gnon’s interior ‘or’ is not equation, but
        suspension. It tells us nothing about God or Nature, but only that
        Reality Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heidegger comes close to glimpsing Gnon, by noting that ‘God’ is not a
        philosophically satisfactory response to the Question of Being. Since
        Heidegger’s principal legacy is the acknowledgment that we don’t yet
        know how to formulate the Question of Being, this insight achieves
        limited penetration. What it captures, however, is the philosophical
        affinity of Gnon, whose yawn is a space of thought beyond faith and
        infidelity. Neither God nor Un-God adds fundamental ontological
        information, unless from out of the occulted depths of Gnon.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dark Enlightenment isn’t yet greatly preoccupied with fundamental
        ontological arcana (although it will be eventually). Beyond radical
        realism, its communion in the dread rites of Gnon is bound to two
        leading themes: cognitive non-coercion, and the structure of history.
        These themes are mutually repulsive, precisely because they are so
        intimately twisted together. <em>Intellectual freedom</em> has been the
        torch of secular enlightenment, whilst <em>divine providence</em> has
        organized the perspective of tradition. It is scarcely possible to
        entertain either without tacitly commenting on the other, and in
        profundity, they cannot be reconciled. If the mind is free, there can be
        no destiny. If history has a plan, cognitive independence is illusory.
        No solution is even imaginable … except in Gnon.

        <h4 class="post-title">Gnon-Theology and Time</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        A discussion of Gnon-Theology and Time deserves a preface, on
        Gnon-Theology, but there are several reasons to leap-frog that. Most
        obviously, it would be yet another prologue to an introduction to the
        first part of a promised series, and readers of this blog are quite
        probably thoroughly saturated (to the point of <del>mild</del> nausea)
        with that. It’s a cognitive disease, and it would be presumptuous to
        expect anybody else to take the same morbid interest in backward
        cascades that this blog does.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more interesting reason to avoid prefacing the question of time,
        along any avenue of investigation, is that such methodical precautions
        are grave errors in this case. There is nothing more basic than time, or
        preliminary to it. In naming a preface or prologue, it is already
        introduced.  Time is a problem that cannot be conceptually pre-empted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"

          title="More..." /><a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-cult-of-gnon/">Gnon</a>
        suspends ontological decision about God. It begins from what is real,
        whether God exists or not. A Gnon-trance is unsettled. It is
        <em>not yet agnostic</em>, any more than it is decidedly theistic or
        atheistic. It concerns itself primarily with that which has been
        accepted as real before anything is believed, and subsequently with
        whatever can be attained through methodical negation of intellectual
        haste.  Since suspension is its only positive determination, it
        collapses towards a raw intuition of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evidently, Gnon-Theology cannot be dogmatic, even in part. Instead, it
        is <em>hypothetical</em>, in a maximally reduced sense, in which the
        hypothesis is an opportunity for cognitive exploration unshackled from
        ontological commitments. The content of Gnon-Theology is exhausted by
        the question: <em>What does the idea of God enable us to think?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And ‘the idea of God’? — what in the name of Gnon is that? All we know,
        at first,  is that it has been grit-blasted of all encrustations from
        either positive or negative faith. It cannot be anything with which we
        have historical or revelatory familiarity, since it reaches us from out
        of the abyss (<em>epoche</em>), where only time and / or the unknown
        remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glutted on forbidden fruit, Gnon-Theology strips God like an engine,
        down to the limit of abstraction, or <em>eternity for-itself</em>. Does
        any such perspective exist? We already know that this is not our
        question. All such ‘regional ontology’ has been suspended. We are
        nevertheless already entitled, through the grace of Gnon (which —
        remember — might (or might not) be God), to the assumption or acceptance
        of reality that: for any God to be God it cannot be less than eternity
        for-itself. Whatever eternity for-itself entails, any God will, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it entails, unambiguously, is time-travel, in the strong sense of
        reverse causation, although not necessarily in the folk/Hollywood
        variant (<a href="http://www.math.siu.edu/Kocik/tm/tm-all-ch.htm">which</a>
        has also had serious defenders) based on the retro-transportation of
        physical objects into the past.
        <em>Knowledge of the future is indistinguishable from counter-chronic
          transmission of information</em>. This is perhaps the single most critical insight in realistic
        time-travel research — we’ll get
        <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Out_of_Time">back</a>
        to it. (If anyone finds it less than logically irresistible, use the
        comments thread.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To accelerate this discussion with bloggish crudity, on a heading out of
        Gnon-Theology into Occidental religious history (and to the possibility
        of sleep), we can jump to one simple, certain, and secure conclusion: No
        Christian can consistently deny the reality of time-travel. The
        objection ‘if (reverse) time-travel if possible, where are the
        time-travellers?’ is annulled by the Christian revelation itself.
        Messianic Incarnation (of God or eternity for-itself), along with all
        true prophecy,  providential history, and answered prayer, instantiates
        time-travel with technical exactitude. There can be no truth whatsoever
        to the Christian religion unless time-travel has fundamentally
        structured human history. Whatever else Christianity might be, it is a
        time-travel story, and one that at times appears to be peculiarly
        lacking in clear self-understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Time-travel, it should perhaps be noted explicitly, has no obvious
        dependency on Christianity, or even upon the God of Gnon-Theology. That
        is a topic for other occasions.)

        <h4 class="post-title">Simulated Gnon-Theology</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        This post was to have been about the
        <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">simulation argument</a>, but Gnon does the
        preliminary work. Whether or not we are living in a
        computer simulation can quickly come to seem like a derivative
        consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nature or Nature’s God, (un)known here as Gnon, provides skepticism with
        its ultimate object. With this name we can advance in suspension,
        freeing thought from any ground in belief. In its mundane application,
        Gnon permits realism to exceed doctrinal conviction, reaching reasonable
        conclusions amongst uncertain information. Its invocation, however, is
        not necessarily mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume, momentarily, that God exists. If this assumption comes easily,
        so much the better. It is probably obvious, almost immediately, that you
        do not yet have a clear idea about what you are thus assuming. To mark
        exactly this fact, the established Abrahamic religions propose that you
        designate God by a proper name, which corresponds to a definite yet
        profoundly occulted personal individual. Approaching the same obscurity
        from the other side, emphasizing the problematic rather than relational
        aspect, I will persevere in the name of Gnon.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid gratuitous idolatry, all our
        subsequent assumptions must be readily retractable. It is not our
        mission to tell Gnon what it is. We cannot but be aware, from the
        beginning, that two perplexing, and inter-twined sources of idolatry
        will be especially difficult to dispel, due to their conceptual
        intractability, and their insinuation into the basic fabric of grammar
        and narrative. In merely using the tensed verb ‘to be’, and in unfolding
        a process in stages, we unwittingly idolize Gnon as a subordinate of
        being and time. Our sole refuge lies in the recognition, initially
        inarticulate, that to think Gnon as God is to advance a
        hyper-ontological and meta-chronic hypothesis. From Gnon’s
        self-understanding, being and time have to emerge as exhaustively
        comprehended consequences (even though we have no idea – at all – what
        this might mean).
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gnon is God, it is the reality of infinite intelligence. Occidental
        religious tradition divides this ultimate infinitude into the topics of
        omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, at the risk of
        introducing footholds for anthropomorphism – and thus idolatry.
        Accepting a contrary risk (one that Pope Benedict XVI specifically
        indicated as Islamic?), I will simply dismiss the possibility that God
        can be <i>theologically</i> other than good, since this would be an
        invitation to Lovecraftian speculations of distracting vividness.
        Thomist scholasticism offers a further simplification, by proposing that
        what there is to know, is that which God creates. Pursued (perhaps) one
        step further: Self-knowledge is the auto-creation of a ‘being’ that
        thinks itself into reality. This, too, offers a conceptual economy to be
        eagerly seized.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation of the universe is of concern to humans, and the creation
        of angels is a grave matter for Satan, but for Gnon they can only be
        trivialities (it might be unnecessarily antagonistic to say
        ‘amusements’). For Gnon – as God – the Cantorian transfinite realm is
        self-identity, or less, whose infinite parts are each infinities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless choosing to blaspheme, we can only assume that Gnon thinks
        serious thoughts, of a kind that have some relevance to its thinking
        about itself, and thus ensuring itself in its (hyper-ontological)
        auto-creation. Such thoughts surely encompass the creation of gods,
        since that – for (a) God – is simply the transfinite as intelligent
        activity. If for Gnon to know what it can do is already to have done it,
        because divine intelligence is creation, anything less than an infinite
        pantheon would be evidence of retardation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Gnon, as God, gods are infinitesimals, so that any thorough
        self-investigation would involve them. It is effortlessness itself, for
        It, to thus create an infinite being – among an infinity of such beings
        – each of which, being infinite, is made of infinities, and these in
        turn, as infinities, consist of infinite infinities, without end. This
        is no more than Cantor had already understood, at the most elementary
        stage of his transfinite explorations, although, being a human creature,
        his understanding was not immediately creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Satan, a mere arch-angel, could imagine himself a god, and not only a
        god, but – in potential at least – God seated upon the throne of
        ultimate sovereignty, is it possible that no god thinks itself God? And
        if a god can, if only in possibility, think itself God, can God not
        think this rebellion – and thus know it — which is to create it (or make
        it real)? Does not God’s self-understanding necessitate the creation of
        cosmic insurrection? From the Satanic perspective, such questions are
        overwhelmingly fascinating, but they lead to a more intricate
        predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Gnon (as God) thinks through its gods, as it can only do, the
        thought necessarily arises: If these god creatures can confuse
        themselves with God, could not my self-understanding as God also be a
        confusion?

        <h4 class="post-title">Gnon and OOon</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Twitter gets people counting characters, and thus numerizing language.
        In only a very few cases does this microcultural activity tilt over into
        the wilder extravagances of exotic qabbalism, but it nudges intelligence
        in that direction. Even when the only question is strictly Boolean —
        will this message squeeze into a tweet, or not? — words acquire a
        supplementary significance from their numerical properties alone. A
        phrase is momentarily numbered, in the crudest of ways, which the tweet
        box registers as a countdown towards zero, and then into the negative
        accumulation of over-spill. Twitter thus promotes a rigidly
        convention-bound semiotic practice, which it simultaneously hides,
        technologically instantiating a precise analog of hermetic ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qabbalism is the science of spookiness, which makes it a natural
        companion on any expedition into horror. There is, in addition, an
        intrinsic reactionary slant to its ultra-traditionalism and attachment
        to the principle of hierarchical revelation. Its concrete history
        provides an unsurpassable example of spontaneous auto-catalysis (from
        discrepant conventions of arithmetical notation). This post, however, is
        restricted to a very preliminary discussion of its most basic
        intellectual presupposition, <em>as if</em> it had been developed out of
        an implicit philosophy (which it was not). It will be coaxed into
        <em>making sense</em>, against the grain of its essential inclination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the Abrahamic tradition, the Word of
        God anticipates creation. Insofar as scripture faithfully records this
        Word, the holy writings correspond to a level of reality more
        fundamental than nature, and one that the ‘book of nature’ references,
        as the key to its final meaning. The unfolding of creation in time
        follows a narrative plotted in eternity, in which history and divine
        providence are necessarily identical. There can be no
        <em>true</em> accidents, or coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Book of Creation is legible, and intelligible. It can be read, and
        it tells a story. The noisy squabbles between religious orthodoxy and
        natural science that have erupted in modern times threaten to drown out
        the deeper continuities of presumption, which frame the rancorous
        contention between ‘belief’ and ‘disbelief’ as an intimate domestic
        dispute. This is nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the
        declaration
        <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Francis_Bacon">attributed</a>
        to Francis Bacon: “My only earthly wish is… to stretch the deplorably
        narrow limits of man’s dominion over the universe to their promised
        bounds… [nature will be] bound into service, hounded in her wanderings
        and put on the rack and tortured for her secrets.” There is no doubt
        that nature can speak, and has a story to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resisting any temptation to take sides in this family argument, we refer
        neutrally to Gnon (“nature or nature’s God”), ignoring all dialectics,
        and departing in another direction. The distinction to be drawn does not
        differentiate between belief and unbelief, but rather discriminates
        between exoteric and esoteric religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any system of belief (and complementary unbelief) that appeals to
        universal endorsement is necessarily exoteric in orientation. Like the
        witch-finders, or Francis Bacon, it declares war upon the secret, in the
        name of a public cult, whose central convictions are dispensed commonly.
        The Pope is the Pope, and Einstein is Einstein, because the access to
        truth that elevates them above other men is — in its innermost nature —
        the equal possession of all. The pinnacle of understanding is attained
        through a public formula. This is democracy in its deepest, creedal
        sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esoteric religion accepts all of this, <em>about exoteric religion</em>.
        It confirms the solidarity between doctrinal authorities and the beliefs
        of the masses, whilst exempting itself, privately, from the public cult.
        Its discreet attention is directed away from the exoteric mask of Gnon,
        into — or out towards — the <em>OOon</em> (or Occult Order of nature).
      </p>
      <p>
        The OOon need not be <em>kept</em> a secret. It is secret by its
        intrinsic, inviolable nature. A very primitive qabbalistic excursion
        should suffice to illustrate this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume, entirely hypothetically, that supernatural intelligence or
        obscure complexities in the topological structure of time had sedimented
        abysmal depths of significance into the superficial occurrences of the
        world. The ‘Book of Creation’ is then legible at (very) many different
        levels, with every random or inconsequential detail of relatively
        exoteric features providing material for systems of information further
        ‘down’. The deeper one excavates into the ‘meaningless chaos’ of the
        exoteric communicative substrate, the more uncluttered one’s access to
        the signals of utter Outsideness. Since ‘one’ is, to its quick, a
        signaletic product, this cryptographic enterprise is irreducibly a
        voyage, transmutation, and disillusionment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most thoroughly documented example is the esoteric reading of the
        Hebrew Bible, which need only be remarked upon here in its most general
        characteristics. Because the Hebrew alphabet serves as both a phonetic
        system and as a set of numerals, each written word in the language has a
        precise numerical value. It is at once at exoteric word, and an esoteric
        number. Nothing prevents an ordinary language user from deliberately
        coding (numerically) as they write, or even as they speak. The key to
        numerical decryption is not a secret, but rather a commonly understood
        cultural resource, utilized by every numerate individual. Nevertheless,
        the linguistic and arithmetical aspects are <em>in fact</em> quite
        strictly separated,  because thinking in words and numbers
        simultaneously is hard, because maintaining sustained parallel
        intelligibility in both is close to impossible, because the attempt to
        do so is (exoterically) senseless, and because practicality dominates.
        The esoteric realm is not forbidden, but simply unneeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Hebrew Bible has not been deliberately crafted as an intricate
        numerical-cryptographic composition by human authors is therefore an
        empirical or contingent fact that can be accepted with extreme
        confidence. Its esoteric channel might of course, as common sense has to
        insist, be empty of anything but noise, but it is no less certainly
        <em>clear</em>. Whatever comes through it, that is anything other than
        nothing, can only come from Outside. It is the real difference between
        exoteric and the esoteric levels that makes the OOon thinkable at all.
        Only that which the exoteric does not touch, is available for the
        esoteric to communicate through, and to have assembled itself from.
        Qabbalism has to be seldom, in order to occur. For that reason, it
        cannot seek to persuade the masses of anything, unless its own
        senselessness. In an age of triumphant exoteria, this is not an easy
        thing to understand (thank Gnon).

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[Gnon is] not a deity, it’s a placeholder. … I’m glad NRx is honest
          enough to admit not knowing the ultimate mystery. … How is an
          admission of ignorance a place of authority? … Catholic NRx submits to
          Christ. Gnon has a similar role to “Providence”. ..in old Rightist
          writings. … “the dread rites of Gnon” is used in a similar spirit as
          Cthulu in Moldbug. … Which is to say, NRx’s fascination with that
          which modern society fears. … It’s turning into the most complex set
          of brackets around a blank space I’ve yet seen.</em>

        It might be necessary to scrub that (or perhaps hose it down). Until

        ready to get out of bed for.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Extinction Events Can Accelerate Evolution’ argue Joel Lehman and Risto
        Miikkulainen (at the link cited). Their abstract:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Extinction events impact the trajectory of biological evolution
          significantly. They are often viewed as upheavals to the evolutionary
          process. In contrast, this paper supports the hypothesis that although
          they are unpredictably destructive, extinction events may in the long
          term accelerate evolution by increasing evolvability. In particular,
          if extinction events extinguish indiscriminately many ways of life,
          indirectly they may select for the ability to expand rapidly through
          vacated niches. Lineages with such an ability are more likely to
          persist through multiple extinctions. Lending computational support
          for this hypothesis, this paper shows how increased evolvability will
          result from simulated extinction events in two computational models of
          evolved behavior. The conclusion is that although they are destructive
          in the short term, extinction events may make evolution more prolific
          in the long term.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (The computer dimension catches Kurzweil’s
        <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/how-mass-extinctions-can-accelerate-robot-evolution">attention</a>, but
        that’s
        a distraction right now.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Chronic cosmic holocaust, it seems, is just for the tweaks. It’s mostly
        conservative, preventing deterioriation in mutational load, through
        quasi-continuous culling of nature’s minor freakeries. In order to
        actually <em>up the game</em>, nothing quite substitutes for a
        super-compressed catastrophe (or mass extinction) which cranks evolution
        to the meta-level of superior ‘evolvability’. By gnawing-off and burning
        entire branches of life, crises plowing deep into the X-risk zone
        stimulate plasticity in the biosphere’s phyletic foundations. As
        Kurzweil glosses the finding: “… some evolutionary biologists
        hypothesize that extinction events actually accelerate evolution by
        promoting those lineages that are the most evolvable, meaning ones that
        can quickly create useful new features and abilities.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, as the Lehman and Miikkulainen paper
        explains:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The overall hypothesis is that repeated extinction events may result
          in increasing evolvability. By creating a survival bottleneck
          dependent upon unpredictable phenotypic traits, extinction events may
          indirectly select for lineages that can diversify quickly across the
          space of such phenotypes. … if radiating through niches generally
          requires modifying phenotypic traits, then this process of stochastic
          emptying and re-filling of ecological niches may select indirectly for
          the ability to radiate quickly, i.e. higher evolvability.</em>

      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/miltonic-regression/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Miltonic Regression</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        John Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em> is the greatest work ever written
        in the English language. It might easily seem absurd, therefore, to
        spend time justifying its importance, especially when the question of
        justification is this work’s own most explicit topic, tested at the edge
        of impossibility, where the entire poem is drawn. Perhaps it makes more
        sense, preliminarily, to narrow our ambition, seeking only to
        <em>justify the words of Milton to modern men</em>, especially to those
        for whom modernity has become a distressing cultural problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to what is today called the Cathedral, Milton is both disease
        and cure. Both simultaneously, cryptically entangled, complicated by
        strange collisions, opening multitudinous, obscure paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the most articulate anglophone voice of revolutionary Puritanism, he
        arrives amongst Carlyleans in the mask of “the Arch-Enemy” (I:81) and
        “Author of Evil” (VI:262): a scourge of clerical and monarchical
        authority, a pamphleteer in defense of regicide and the liberalization
        of divorce, an Arian, and a Roundhead of truly Euclidean spheritude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet his institutional radicalism was driven
        by a cultural traditionalism that will never again be equaled. Milton
        comprehensively, minutely, and unreservedly affirms the foundations of
        Occidental civilization down to their biblical and classical roots,
        studied with supreme capability in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and
        vigorously re-animated through modulations in the grammar, vocabulary,
        and thematics of modernity’s rough emerging tongue. His devotion to
        <em>all original authorities</em> stretches thought and language to the
        point of delirium, where poetry and metaphysics find common purpose in
        the excavation of utter primordiality and the limits of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed in compliance with “Eternal Providence” to “justify the ways of
        God to men” (I:25-6), the linguistic modernity of
        <em>Paradise Lost</em> soon required its own justification, in the form
        of a short prefatory remark entitled <em>The Verse</em>. Here, Milton
        characteristically insists that radicalism is restoration, breaking from
        a shallow past in order to re-connect with deeper antiquity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… true musical delight … consists only in apt numbers, fit quantity
          of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into
          another, not in the jingling sound of like endings — a fault avoided
          by the learned ancients both in poetry and in all good oratory. The
          neglect then of rhyme so little is to be taken for a defect, though it
          may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers, that it rather is to be
          esteemed an example set — the first in English — of ancient liberty
          recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of
          riming.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        English passes through a revolutionary catastrophe to recall things long
        lost. The rusted keys which still open the near future of the Cathedral
        also access dread spaces forgotten since the beginning of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Before their eyes in sudden view appear<br />
          The secrets of the hoary deep, a dark<br />
          Illimitable ocean, without bound,<br />
          Without dimension, where length, breadth, and height,<br />
          And time, and place, are lost, where eldest Night<br />
          And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold<br />
          Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise<br />
          Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.</em><br />
        (II:890-897)
      </p>
      <p>
        Among all the regressive Miltonic currents to be followed, those
        emptying into Old Night (I:544, II:1002) will carry us furthest …

        <h4 class="post-title">Zero-Centric History</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Reaction – even Neoreaction – tends to be hard on Modernity. God knows
        (so to speak) there are innumerable reasons for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the criterion of judgment is set by the Occident, whether determined
        through its once dominant faith or its once dominant people, the case
        against Modernity is perhaps unanswerable. The Western civilization in
        which Modernity ignited was ultimately combusted by it. From an
        Occidental Traditionalist perspective, Modernity is a complex and
        prolonged suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Ultra-Modernist, who affirms the creative destruction of anything in
        modernization’s path, assumes an alternative criterion, inherent to
        Modernity itself. It asks: What had to happen to the West for it to
        become modern? What was the <em>essential</em> event? The answer (and
        our basic postulate): Zero arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that arithmetical zero does not make
        capitalism on its own, because it pre-existed the catalysis of Modernity
        by several centuries (although less than a millennium). Europe was
        needed, as a matrix, for its explosive historical activation.
        <em>Outside in</em> is persuaded that the critical conditions
        encountered by zero-based numeracy in the pre-Renaissance northern
        Mediterranean world decisively included extreme socio-political
        fragmentation, accompanied by cultural susceptibility to dynamic
        spontaneous order. (This is a topic for another occasion.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In Europe, zero was an alien, and from the perspective of parochial
        tradition, an infection. Cultural resistance was explicit, on
        theological grounds, among others. Implicit in the Ontological Argument
        for the existence of God was the definition of non-being as an ultimate
        imperfection, and ‘cipher’ – whose name was Legion – evoked it. The
        cryptic Eastern ‘algorism’ was an unwelcome stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zero latched, because the emergence of capitalism was inseparable from
        it. The calculations it facilitated, through the gateway of double-entry
        book-keeping, proved indispensable to sophisticated commercial and
        scientific undertakings, locking the incentives of profit and power on
        the side of its adoption. The practical advantage of its notational
        technique overrode all theoretical objections, and no authority in
        Europe’s shattered jig-saw was positioned to suppress it. The world had
        found its dead center, or been found by it.

        <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-that-Natural-History-Zero/dp/0195142373">The Nothing That Is: A
            Natural
            History of Zero</a></em>
        is an excellent guide to these developments. He notes that, at the dawn
        of the Renaissance:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Just as pictorial space, which had been ordered hierarchically (size
          of figure corresponded to importance), was soon to be put in
          perspective through the device of a vanishing-point, a visual zero; so
          the zero of positional notation was the harbinger of a reordering of
          social and political space.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Capitalism – or techno-commercial explosion – massively promoted
        calculation, which normalized zero as a number. Kaplan explains:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[The growth of] a language for arithmetic and algebra … was to have
          far-reaching consequences. The uncomfortable gap between numbers,
          which stood for things, and zero, which didn’t, would narrow as the
          focus shifted from what they were to how they behaved. Such behavior
          took place in equations – and the solution of an equation, the number
          which made it balance, was as likely to be zero as anything else.
          Since the values x concealed were all of a kind, this meant the gap
          between zero and other numbers narrowed even more.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is how zero, as a number rather than a mere syntactic marker, crept
        in. In three of the elementary arithmetical operations the behavior of
        zero is regular, and soon accepted as ordinary. It is of course an
        extreme number, perfectly elusive in the operations of addition and
        subtraction, whilst demonstrating an annihilating sovereignty in
        multiplication, but in none of these cases does it perturb calculation.
        Division by zero is different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zero denotes dynamization from the Outside. It is a boundary sign,
        marking the edge, where the calculable crosses the insoluble.
        Consolidated within Modernity as an indispensable quantity, it retains a
        liminal quality, which would eventually be exploited (although not
        resolved) by the calculus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pure conception of zero suggests strict reciprocity with infinity,
        so compellingly that the greatest mathematicians of ancient India were
        altogether seduced by it. Bhaskara II (1114–1185) confidently asserted
        that <em>n</em>/0 = infinity, and in the West Leonhard Euler concurred.
        (The seduction persists, with John D. Barrow writing in 2001: “Divide
        any number by zero and we get infinity.”)
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet this equation, appearing as the most profound conclusion accessible
        to rigorous intelligence, is not obtainable without contradiction.
        “Why?” [Kaplan again]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Our Indian mathematicians help us here: any number times zero is zero
          — so that 6×0 and 17×0 = 0. Hence 6×0 = 17×0. If you could divide by
          zero, you’d get (6×0)/0 = (17×0)/0, the zeroes would cancel out and 6
          would equal 17. … This sort of proof by contradiction was known since
          ancient Greece. Why hadn’t anyone in India hit on it at this moment,
          when it was needed?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kaplan’s proof demonstrates that for zero, peculiarly, multiplication
        and division are not reciprocal operations. They occupy an axis that
        transects an absolute limit, neatly soluble on one side, problematical
        on the other. Zero is revealed as an obscure door, a junction connecting
        arithmetical precision with philosophical (or religious) predicaments,
        intractable to established procedures. When attempting to reverse
        normally out of a mundane arithmetical operation, a liminal signal is
        triggered: <em>access denied</em>.

        <h4 class="post-title">Diversionary History</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        If there’s one thing everybody seems to agree about the history of zero,
        it’s that it was driven primarily by notational considerations. More
        specifically, zero was required to enable positional notation. The
        historical record reinforces this assumption, to such an extent that it
        becomes apparently obvious, and thus unproblematic.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance (grabbing what’s immediately to hand), John D Barrow’s
        <em>The Book of Nothing</em> organizes its discussion of ‘the Origin of
        Zero’ by relating how
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… the zero sign and a positional significance when reading the value
          of a symbol, are features that lie at the heart of the development of
          efficient human counting systems.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert Kaplan, when discussing the retardation of Greek arithmetical
        notation, explains:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… the continuing lack of positional notation meant that [the Greeks]
          still had no symbol for zero.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As everyone ‘knows’, the Babylonians, and
        later the Indians, got it right: discovering or inventing a sign for
        zero to mark the empty place required for unambiguous
        positional-numerical values. Zero arose, and spread, because it allowed
        modular number systems to develop. Except that, <em>conceptually</em>,
        there is no basis to this story at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Counting is primarily practical, so that no argument counts for much
        besides a demonstration. In this case, demonstration is peculiarly
        simple, especially when it is noted that nobody seems to think it
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modulus-2 is convenient, but there is nothing magical about it in this
        regard. A decimal demonstration, for instance, would be no more
        intellectually taxing, although it would be considerably more
        cumbersome. Any modulus works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with the basics. The positions or places of a modular notational
        systems represent powers. If we count from zero, the number of each
        successive place (ascending to the left by our established convention)
        corresponds to the modular exponent. The zeroth power for a single digit
        number, the first and then zeroth power for two digits, the second,
        first and zeroth power for three digits, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the accepted story goes, each place must be filled, if only by a
        <em>marked</em> nothing (zero), if the proper places, and their
        corresponding (modular exponential) values, are to be read. The places
        must indeed be filled.
        <em>There is no need whatsoever for a zero sign to do this</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The demonstration, then. Our non-zero modulus-2 positional system has
        two signs, 1 and 2, each bearing its familiar values. The places also
        have their mod-2 values, counting in sixteens, eights, fours, twos, and
        units as they decline to the right. Here we go, counting from 1 to 31
        (watch carefully for the point at which the supposedly indispensable
        zero sign is needed):
      </p>
      <p>
        1, 2, 11, 12, 21, 22, 111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222, 1111,
        1112, 1121, 1122, 1211, 1212, 1221, 1222, 2111, 2112, 2121, 2122, 2211,
        2212, 2221, 2222, 1111 …
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: the positional function of zero is wholly superfluous. The
        Greeks, or anybody else, could have instantiated a simple,
        fully-functional positional-numerical notation without any need to
        accommodate themselves to the trauma of zero. In regard to this matter,
        the history of numeracy is utterly diversionary (not just the
        historiography, but the substantial history — the <em>facts</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps this won’t seem puzzling to people, but it puzzles the hell out
        of me.

      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/xenotation-1/">
        <h4 class="post-title">Xenotation (#1)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        From Euclid’s Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA), or unique prime
        factorization theorem, we know that
        <em>any natural number greater than one that is not itself prime can be
          uniquely identified as a product of primes</em>. The decomposition of a number into (one or more) primes is
        its
        <em>canonical representation</em> or <em>standard form</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the FTA, arithmetic attains the cultural absolute. Number is
        comprehended beyond all traditional contingency, as it exists for any
        competent intelligence whatsoever, human, alien, technological, or yet
        unimagined. We encounter the basic semantics of the Outside
        (comprehending all possible codes).
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as numerical notation is constructed in a way that is extraneous
        to the FTA, we remain Greek. Our number signs fall lamentably short of
        our arithmetical insight, stammering deep patterns in a rough,
        ill-formed tongue. Stubbornly and inflexibly, we translate Number into
        terms that we know deform it, as if its true language was of no interest
        to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, given only the FTA, the code of the
        Outside — or Xenotation — is readily accessible. Nothing is required
        except compliance with abstract reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        A single operation suffices to count. In words, it matters little what
        we call it — implexion, envelopment, wrapping, or bracketing describe it
        with increasing vulgarity. For convenience, parenthesis — ‘( )’ —
        provides a sign. The semiotic (or purely formal) equation ‘( ) = 0’
        offers additional economy. Xenotation needs nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is redundant to the FTA. It begins with two, the first prime. This
        introduces our sole notational principle, and operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every number has an ordinality and a cardinality (an index and a
        magnitude). Crudely represented, through a mixture of barbarous signs,
        we can see these twin aspects as they are relevant here:<br />
        First (Prime =) 2<br />
        Second (P =) 3<br />
        Third (P =) 5<br />
        Fourth (P =) 7
      </p>
      <p>
        By wrapping an ordinate (or index), itself a number, the Xenotation
        marks a magnitude. So ‘(first)’ or ‘(1)’ = 2. One, we know, is
        superfluous, and thus economized: (1) = ( ) = 0. Remembering that ‘0’ is
        henceforth the sign for the initial implexion, and not the familiar
        (though cryptic) numeral, we can now depart from all notational
        tradition. [The further usage of decimal numerals, in hard brackets,
        will be strictly explanatory, and dispensable.]
      </p>
      <p>
        An implexion signifies the number designated by the enclosed index. Once
        this rule is understood, Xenotation unfolds automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        0 [= 2]<br />
        (0) [= 3, the second prime]<br />
        ((0)) [= 5, the third prime]<br />
        (((0))) [= 11, the fifth prime]
      </p>
      <p>Compound numbers are signified in accordance with the FTA:</p>
      <p>
        00 [= 2 x 2 = 4]<br />
        000 [= 2 x 2 x 2 = 8]<br />
        (0)0 [= 3 x 2 = 6]<br />
        ((0))(0) [= 5 x 3 = 15]
      </p>
      <p>For primes with compound indices, the procedure is unchanged:</p>
      <p>
        (00) [= 7, the fourth (2 x 2) prime]<br />
        ((0)0) [= 13, the sixth (3 x 2) prime]<br />
        ((0)(0)) [= 23, the ninth (3 x 3) prime]
      </p>
      <p>So the xenotated Naturals [from 2-31] proceed:</p>
      <p>
        0, (0), 00, ((0)), (0)0, (00), 000, (0)(0), ((0))0, (((0))), (0)00,
        ((0)0), (00)0, ((0))(0), 0000, ((00)), (0)(0)0, (000), ((0))00, (00)(0),
        (((0)))0, ((0)(0)), (0)000, ((0))((0)), ((0)0)0, (0)(0)(0), (00)00,
        (((0))0), ((0))(0)0, ((((0)))) …
      </p>

        is the firm assertion of this blog that Neoreaction is intrinsically
        arcane.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not talk very much about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss">Leo</a>
        <a href="https://leostrausscenter.uchicago.edu/">Strauss</a>. Once
        again, there are some obvious reasons for this, but also others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Sailer’s recent <em>Takimag</em>
        <a href="http://takimag.com/article/from_taboo_to_common_sense_steve_sailer/print#ixzz3EadQTakr">article</a>
        on Strauss makes for a convenient introduction, because — despite its
        light touch — it moves a number of issues into place. The constellation
        of voices is complex from the start. There is the (now notorious)
        ‘Neo-Conservatism’ of Strauss and his disciples, or manipulators, and
        the <em>other</em> conservatism of Sailer, each working to manage,
        openly and in secret, its own peculiar mix of public statement and
        discretion. Out beyond them — because even the shadowiest figures have
        further shadows — are more alien, scarcely perceptible shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailer’s article is typically smart, but also deliberately crude. It
        glosses the Straussian idea of esoteric writing as “talking out of both
        sides of your mouth” — as if hermetic traditionalism were reducible to a
        lucid political strategy, or simple conspiracy — to ‘Illuminism’,
        politically conceived. In the wake of its Neo-Con trauma, conservatism
        has little patience for “secret decoder rings”. Yet, despite his
        aversion to the recent workings of inner-circle ‘conservative’
        sophisticates, Sailer does not let his distaste lure him into stupidity:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We haven’t heard much about Straussianism lately due to the
          unfortunate series of events in Iraq that befell the best-laid plans
          of the sages. But that doesn’t mean that Strauss was necessarily wrong
          about the ancients. And that has interesting implications for how we
          should read current works.</em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>As the approaching 20th anniversary of the publication of
          <a href="http://www.amren.com/news/2004/10/you_have_to_tel/">The Bell Curve</a>
          reminds us, the best minds of our age have reasons for being less than
          wholly frank.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailer is not, of course, a neoreactionary.
        Not even secretly. (That is what his article is primarily about.) He
        believes in the public sphere, and seeks to heal it with honesty. Any
        pessimism he might harbor in regards to this ambition falls far short of
        the dark scission that would hurl him over the line. His differences
        with the Straussians are, in the end, merely tactical. Both retain
        confidence in the
        <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~peter.a.taylor/moldbug.htm">Outer</a>
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008_08_01_archive.html">Party</a>
        as a vehicle for policy promotion, with the potential to master the
        public sphere. The question is only about the degree of deviousness this
        will require (minimal for Sailer, substantial for the Straussians).
      </p>
      <p>
        When adopted into Neoreaction, the HBD current has an altogether more
        corrosive influence upon attitudes to the public sphere, which is
        understood as a teleologically cohesive (or self-organizing), inherently
        directional, and (from ‘our’ perspective) radically hostile social
        agency. To baptize the public sphere as ‘the Cathedral’ is to depart
        from conservatism. It is no longer possible to imagine it as a space
        that could be conquered — even surreptitiously — by forces differing
        significantly from those it already incarnates. It is what it is, and
        that is something historically singular, ideologically specific, and
        highly determined in its social orientation. It swims left, essentially.
        The public sphere is not the battlefield, but the enemy.

        As NRx seeks to navigate this hostile territory, it is tempted
        ambiguously, by a strategic Scylla and Charybdis. A populist lure drags
        it towards a reconciliation with the public sphere, as something it
        could potentially dominate, while a contrary hermetic politics guides it
        towards the formation of closed groups (whose parodic symbol is the
        locked twitter account). Both options — ‘clearly’ — are a flight from
        the complexity of the
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/alphanomics/">integral</a>
        <em>open secret</em>. They both promise a relaxation of semiotic stress,
        through collapse of multi-level communication into a simplified frank
        discourse, whether implanted within a redeemed public culture, or
        circulated cautiously within restricted circles. The problem of
        hierarchy would be extracted from the signs of Neoreaction, through
        conversion into a public or private object, rather than working them
        incessantly from within. What is underway would become (simply) clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such clarity cannot happen. The alternative is not an (equally simple)
        obscurity. NRx, insofar as it continues to propagate, advances by
        becoming clear <em>and also unclear</em>. Double writing scarcely
        scratches the surface. It realizes hierarchy through signs,
        continuously, in accordance with Providence, or the Occult Order of
        nature (the
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/gnon-and-ooon/">OOon</a>). To assume
        that the author is fully initiated into this spectrum of meanings is a
        grave error. It is the process that speaks, multiplicitously, and
        predominantly in secret, as it spreads across an open, publicly-policed
        space.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is now determined to slip the leash, and leap into the
        raggedness of thematic notes. The Open Secret intersects:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Cathedral censure, in the case of
        <a href="http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/">HBD</a> most
        prominently, but also everywhere that
        <a href="http://laurie-penny.com/why-were-winning-social-justice-warriors-and-the-new-culture-war/">fired</a>–<a
          href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/09/the_fappening_ebola_chan_revenge_porn_why_isn_t_4chan_s_founder_accountable.html">up</a>
        SJWs make a fight. War is deception, which makes frankness a tactic.
        Deontological honesty is inept. Anonymity is often crucial to survival.
        (Demands that all enemies of the Cathedral boldly ‘come out’ are
        ludicrously misconceived.) Camouflage is to be treasured.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Crypto-technologies are central to any NRx concerns emphasizing
        practicality. (The idea that classic Moldbug
        <a href="http://complexmeme.net/thoughts/2010/10/12/an-addendum-to-that-last.html">attention</a>
        to the prospects of ‘crypto-locking’ is a joke, it itself thoughtless.)
        <a href="http://urbit.org/">Urbit</a> — an Open Secret — could quite
        easily be more NRx than NRx, just as Bitcoin is more An-Cap than
        Anarcho-Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The intelligence <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">services</a> have
        been under-theorized, and perhaps even under-solicited, by NRx to date.
        At the lowest, i.e. most publicly accessible — level of discussion, this
        is quite possibly a virtue. At more cryptic levels of micro-social and
        analytical endeavor, it is almost certainly an inadequacy. People
        trained to keep secrets have to be interesting to us. Subtle questions
        of subversion arise.

        <h4 class="post-title">On Difficulty</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        From the moment of its inception, <em>Outside in</em> has been camped at
        the <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/outsideness-2/">edge</a> of the
        ‘reactosphere’ — and everything that occurs under the label ‘NRx’ is (at
        least nominally) its concern. As this territory has expanded, from a
        compact redoubt to sprawling tracts whose boundaries are lost beyond
        misty horizons, close and comprehensive scrutiny has become impractical.
        Instead, themes and trends emerge, absorbing and carrying mere
        incidents. Like climatic changes, or vague weather-systems, they suggest
        patterns of persistent and diffuse development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among these rumblings, the most indefinite, tentative, and unresolved
        tend to the aesthetic. Without settled criteria of evaluation, there is
        little obvious basis for productive collision. Instead, there are
        idiosyncratic statements of appreciation, expressed as such, or adamant
        judgments of affirmation or negation, surging forth, draped in the
        heraldic finery of the absolute, before collapsing back into the
        hollowness of their unsustainable pretensions. As things stand, when
        somebody posts a picture of some architectural treasure, or classical
        painting, remarking (or more commonly merely insinuating) “You
        <em>should</em> all esteem this,” there is no truly appropriate response
        but laughter. If there were not a profound problem exactly in this
        regard, NRx would not exist. Criteria are broken, strewn, and
        dispossessed, authoritative tradition is smashed, infected, or reduced
        to self-parody, the Muses raped and butchered. That’s where we are in
        the land of the dying sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        An associated, insistent murmur concerns communicative lucidity. This is
        not solely a question of aesthetics, but in its quavering
        groundlessness, it behaves as one. It arises most typically as the
        assertion — initially unsupported and subsequently undeveloped — that
        <em>clearly</em>, ‘unnecessary obscurity’ <em>should</em> be condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The culpability of this blog as a vortex of
        euphoric obscurantism can scarcely be doubted, so addressing the
        challenge approaches a duty. Setting aside, for the moment, the social
        and cryptographic
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/open-secret/">aspects</a> of the
        topic, as well as the specific critique of human cognition for its
        intolerance of real
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/abstract-threat/">obscurity</a>
        (comparatively articulate from my perspective, if obscure from others),
        this post will
        <del datetime="2014-10-05T05:57:09+00:00">directly</del> pursue the
        question of language.
      </p>
      <p>
        This question is first of all about trust. Even in this, initial regard,
        it is already <em>difficult</em>. As a complex tool, there are things it
        can do, and things it cannot do. Speaking approximately, and
        uncertainly, if it is directed towards those undertakings which have,
        over eons, exercised selective pressure upon it — meeting the social
        necessities of paleolithic human groups — then an assumption of its
        inherent trustworthiness is at least plausible. To extend such an
        assumption further is sheer recklessness. Nothing in linguistics
        supports the wild hypothesis that this code, developed piecemeal for
        primate social coordination, is <em>necessarily</em> adequate to modern
        cognitive challenges. Grammar is not sound epistemology. Mathematicians
        have abandoned ‘natural language’ entirely. To presume that language
        <em>allows us to think</em> is a leap of faith. Radical distrust is the
        more rigorous default.
      </p>
      <p>
        To promote ‘clarity’ as an obvious ideal, needing no further
        justification, is a demand that language — as such — can be trusted,
        that it is competent for all reasonable communicative tasks, and
        ‘reason’ can be defined in a way that makes this assertion tautological
        (such a definition is eminently traditional). “I give you my word”
        language is not predisposed to deception — no thoughtful investigator
        has ever found themselves in concurrence with such a claim. Vocabularies
        are retardation, and grammar, when it is more than a game, is a lie.
        Language is good only for language games, and among these trust games
        are the most irredeemably stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no general obligation to write
        <em>in order to attack language</em>, but that is what Xenosystems does,
        and will continue to do. Language in not a neutral conveyor of infinite
        communicative possibility, but an intelligence box. It is to be counted
        among the traps to be escaped. It is an Exit target — and exit is
        difficult.

        <h4 class="post-title">Occult Xenosystems</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        The swirling delirium at the new
        <a href="https://8chan.co/pol/">/pol/</a> is at least 80% noise, but it
        includes some real intelligence (in both senses of the word), and not
        solely of a
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/our-future/">comedic</a> variety.
        The sheer dirtiness of its signal makes it a powerful antenna, picking
        up on connections and information sources that tidier discussions would
        dismiss as pollution. This makes it especially suited to conspiracy
        theorizing, both inane and exotic.
      </p>
      <p>
        While noting the importance of correction for narcissistic bias, which
        operates through selective attention, memorization, and (from
        commentators here) communication, it seems as if this blog is referenced
        disproportionately by the most extravagant NRx-sensitive /pol/
        conspiracists. That is quite understandable.
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/gnon-and-ooon/">Occult</a>
        philosophy,
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/open-secret/">secrecy</a>,

          href="http://www.xenosystems.net/alphanomics/">codes</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/on-difficulty/">obscurity</a> are
        insistent themes here. <em>Xenosystems</em> is inclined towards arcane
        cultural games. It identifies cryptographic
        <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/">developments</a> as keys to the
        emerging order of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary philosophical task of this blog is to disturb unwarranted
        pretensions to knowing, in the name of a
        <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho">Pyrrhonian</a>
        inspiration. In this regard, confusion, paradox, and uncertainty are
        communicative outcomes to be ardently embraced.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this post, an
        exceptionally exotic /pol/ suggestion provides the opportunity to make a
        comparatively compact and simple point. The occasion is a web of
        conjecture weaving together <em>Xenosystems</em> and
        <em>The Order of Nine Angles</em> (O9A, ONA, or
        <a href="http://omega9alpha.wordpress.com/">omega9alpha</a>). In
        addition to the (highly-recommended) link just provided, the relevant
        Wikipedia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Nine_Angles">entry</a> is
        also extremely stimulating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Xenosystems</em> micro-ethics is uncomfortable with soliciting
        belief (or invoking expectations of trust). It is necessary to note at
        this point, therefore, that the following remarks are not designed to
        appeal to credence, but merely to add testimonial information, to be
        accepted or rejected at will. In the world we now enter — of “sinister
        dialectic” — declarations of honesty are utterly debased. However, for
        what (little) it is worth, these are the facts as I understand and relay
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The O9A is not entirely new to me, but it is not a gnosis I have
        studied, still less deliberately aligned with. The few hours of reading
        I have undertaken today is by far my most intense exposure to it to
        date. What little I have learnt about David Myatt has not attracted me
        to him as a thinker or political activist, despite certain impressive
        characteristics (his intellect and polyglot classicism most notably).
        With that said:<br />
        (1) Many convergent interests are soon apparent between
        <em>Outside in</em> and the <em>O9A</em> (as well as a not
        inconsiderable number of divergences).<br />
        (2) ‘We’ are both (I think) inclined to dismiss the pretensions of the
        individual intellect and will, which makes the possibility of
        connections <em>around the back</em> impossible to dismiss in a
        peremptory fashion. As one /pol/ ‘anonymous’ remarked: “why so sure that
        ONA would be the deepest layer, instead of just a japeful ruse?” Real
        connections, influences, and metaphysical roots are obscure.<br />
        (3) O9A is fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this post (finally) is taken directly from Aleister
        Crowley. In the compilation of his qabbalistic writings entitled
        <em>777</em> (Alphanomic equivalent of
        <em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em>, although that
        is surely coincidental), he makes some introductory remarks on the topic
        of hermeticism. My copy of the book is temporarily misplaced, so I shall
        gloss them here.
        <em>A secret, of the kind relevant to hermeticism, is not something known
          and then hidden as a matter of decision, but rather something that by
          its very nature resists revelation</em>. Crowley proceeds to mock charlatan occultists who treat the numerical
        values of the Hebrew letters as secret information, to be revealed
        theatrically at some appropriate stage of initiation.
        <em>Let whatever can now be known, be known, as lucidly and publicly as
          possible. Only that is truly hermetic which hides itself</em>. Reality is not so destitute of intrinsically
        hidden things — of
        Integral Obscurity — that we need to replenish its coffers with our
        tawdry discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever might exist, in the way of an occult bond between
        <em>Outside in</em> and the <em>O9A</em>, it is not one that anybody is
        <em>keeping secret</em>. To emphasize the point, I am going to include
        the alpha9omega document in the Resources roll here, not as the
        acknowledgement of a connection, but as a clear statement that
        <em>this stuff is not a secret</em>. It is, however, about secrecy — and
        that is interesting.

        I, p.3):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are innumerable niceties concerning <strong>notions</strong>,

        Appealing enough, already, in its light-footed philosophical modernism,
        it becomes utterly sublime when tackled — inversely — by the
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/abstract-horror-note-3/">method</a>
        of ‘hyper-literal anagogy’. It then suggests a Miltonic recovery of
        ancient philosophy, undertaken — with blind irony — by modernity itself.

        While schematic qabbalism is the most rigorous science to which the
        transcendental intellect can aspire, symbolic qabbalism — even that in
        the subtlest Neo-Lemurian vein — merits the very deepest distrust.
        Nevertheless, in this interim period of near-complete exile from
        Cyberspace, there has been plenty of opportunity for exploratory
        calculations. For what little it is worth, 2015 radiates a peculiarly
        distinctive signal, suggesting an emphasis upon the deep state, maritime
        civilization, and mathematical zero, with a dominant oceanic affect.
        This is not an agenda set to provoke obvious resistance at
        <em>Outside in</em>.

      </a>
      <p>(Open thread.)</p>
      <p>
        Still link-deprived, so here’s a puzzle (strictly optional):<br />
        (1) Every Roman Numeral has an
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/alphanomics/">Alphanomic</a> value
        (corresponding to contemporary alphanumeric position, or to alphabetical
        position +9).<br />
        (2) Are there any consistent Roman-Alphanomic numbers?<br />
        (3) The Roman-Alphanomic difference can be conceived as a
        disequilibrium, and the puzzle is an attempt to restore a
        zero-divergence through a syntactically well-constructed Roman number.
        Key, to this method: I (+17), V (+26), X (+23), L (-29), C (-88). Values
        above C are surely unusable: D (-487), M (-978).<br />
        (4) My preliminary conclusion, based on a weakly formalized application
        of the method above, is that there is no correct solution. The only
        candidate I could find is the badly constructed CLXVIIII (= 169), which
        — of course — syntactically collapses to CLXIX (= 117 in
        alphanomics).<br />
        (5) This is a specimen being collected for my qabbalistic quagmires
        compilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: On an even more incidental note (at this stage), the Time Spiral
        Press <a href="http://timespiralpress.net/">site</a> is a malnourished
        formless mess at this stage, but it’s finally on a track to become
        something.

        ADDED:
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chaos-patch-43/#comment-165465">So</a>
        the solution is X-Civ (XCIV, 94, multiple interpretations available,
        among which various lurid options). You can’t make this stuff up.

        <strong>Can I give a small anecdotal</strong> … life’s too short, but
        that’s a fragment of ‘Pilish’
        <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/mathematics/celebrating-pi-our-favourite-non-whole-number">apparently</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Many poems have been written in pilish – “piems”, of course – and
          there’s even a pilish novel 10,000 words long.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since π was proven to be transcendental (by Ferdinand von Lindemann in
        1882) we’ve known that squaring the circle is impossible. Everyone
        reveres Euler’s identity (e^iπ + 1 = 0), but there’s more: “Pi is also
        interesting to mathematicians because it crops up frequently in areas
        with no obvious connection to geometry or circles. For example, if you
        toss a coin 2<em>n</em> times, and <em>n</em> is very large, the
        probability of getting equal numbers of heads and tails is
        1/√(<em>n</em>π).”
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… since pi is an irrational number … the digits in its decimal
          expansion will never repeat in a periodic pattern. It is also likely
          that pi is “normal”, meaning that each of the digits from 0 to 9 will
          appear in the expansion exactly one tenth of the time. Pi’s digits
          seem to mimic randomness exceptionally well, meaning that –
          theoretically, at least – it should be possible to find any number
          string somewhere in pi.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Gödel it has been understood that any possible statement can be
        coded as a number, which means that everything that could ever be said
        lurks somewhere in π. Conceive a library, of arbitrary vastness, and its
        entire contents — perfectly ordered — are virtually pre-existent within
        it. π implicitly anticipates every religious doctrine, philosophy,
        scientific theory, epic novel, and poem — to restrict ourselves to its
        loftier regions. There is nothing mathematics can ever discover that the
        single sign π does not already tacitly whisper to us, if only we could
        read it with absolute intelligence. To taste a speck of infinity
        tomorrow would be appropriate.

      <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-iron-law-of-six/">
        <h4 class="post-title">The Iron Law of Six</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        The <em>Zhouyi</em> (or
        <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">Yijing</a></em>) identifies ultimate cosmic law with the
        order
        of time — which is the
        eternal in change. It consists of hexagrams — figures of six lines —
        because decimated duplication produces the endlessly recurring sequence
        of six phases, in the cycle 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5. As explicitly acknowledged
        in the Ten Wings of the <em>Zhouyi</em>, this six-step cycle is
        diplo-triadic. It consists of two trigrams, or twin triangles, with each
        set of pairs summing through addition to the number nine. Notably,
        exponential growth and rigid cyclicity are integrated in the abstract
        model of time. The ‘byte’ (2^3) still defers to its final authority in
        advanced modernity. That is the robust, arithmetically indisputable
        foundation of The Iron Law of Six.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If you would promote a law, first submit yourself to it.” There is
        perhaps no antidote to moralism sounder than this. How, then, to make of
        The Iron Law of Six an overt, private fatality?
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider
        <a
          href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/01/18/deep-habits-use-index-cards-to-accelerate-important-projects/">this</a>
        (utterly crude) convergence upon the same problem. In an age of
        unprecedentedly scrambled attention, “deep projects” tend to get lost.
        Nothing that is not built into the order of time will get done. (Some
        very relevant neuro-psychological background can be found
        <a href="https://alfinnextlevel.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/viral-brain-networks/">here</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Submission to the order of time is thus indispensable to any real power
        of execution. That time repeats is the only basis upon which to build
        anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formulated in the mode of
        <em>Time: A User’s Guide</em>, this is the Outsideness protocol:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Acknowledge time as that which repeats each day, in a double triad,
        providing six slots. Submission to the Law necessitates that each of
        these slots will receive explicit attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Initiation, proliferation, and compression compose a triad that
        instantiates a ‘Darwinian’ machine. Apply it to everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Compile a list of everything that you are serious about doing.
        Economize by cycling it through the triad. Recognize, realistically,
        that anything which cannot be allotted a slot — i.e. a systematic call
        upon daily attention — will most probably not ever happen. If your work
        requires that you work on more than six projects at a time, which is to
        say some series of projects that cannot be bundled, culled, trimmed, and
        synthesized in rigorous conformity with The Iron Law of Six, then you
        are almost certainly attempting the impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Make a rhythm of innovation. To each thing you would have made real,
        a Time Shrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) Seximalize your life with extraordinary harshness (if you would
        achieve extraordinary things).
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) Only then, when diplo-triadic order exercises sovereign authority
        over your every moment, confidently promote The Iron Law of Six.

        What Peter Thiel has to say is almost always interesting, but it’s what
        he doesn’t say that is the real treasure. The species of abstract horror
        that is <em>abstract thought-crime</em> is

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Everyone has ideas. Everyone has things they believe to be true that
          other people won’t agree with you on. But they’re not things you want
          to say. … You know, the ideas that are really controversial are the
          ones I don’t even want to tell you. I want to be more careful than
          that. I gave you these halfway, in-between ideas that are a little bit
          edgier. […] But I will also go a little bit out on a limb: I think the
          monopoly idea, that the goal of every successful business is to have a
          monopoly, that’s on the border of what I want to say. But the really
          good ideas are way more dangerous than that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Here’s the Biblical application:</p>
      <p>
        <em>I think for the most part, it was necessary for Christ to be very
          careful how he expressed himself. It was mostly in these extremely
          parabolic, indirect modalities, because if it had been too direct, it
          would have been very dangerous. […] It was John Locke, in
          <strong>The Reasonableness of Christianity</strong>, said that Christ
          obviously had to mislead people, since if he had not done so, the
          authorities might have tried to kill him. … That’s the Straussian
          interpretation of Christ. It didn’t end in a particularly Straussian
          way, but it was at least true for most of his ministry.</em>

        a little evasively:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Writing is always such a dangerous thing. […] I remember a professor
          once told me back in the ’80s that writing a book was more dangerous
          than having a child because you could always disown a child if it
          turned out badly. […] You could never disown anything that you’ve
          written. The <strong>Cato Unbound</strong> article, it was a
          thousand-word essay. It was late at night. I quickly typed it off. I
          sent it to someone else to review, who said, “There’s nothing
          controversial in here at all.” … My retrospective was that if you
          actually ask someone to double-check things for whether or not it’s
          controversial, you already deep-down know that you should double-check
          it yourself. … My updated version on it would be that — I made the
          case that I thought democracy and capitalism weren’t quite compatible
          [*facepalm*] — the updated version I would give is it’s not at all
          clear that we’re living in anything resembling a democracy. …</em>

      <p>
        I’m back in the Chinese West, this time with the family (nuclear plus
        mother-in-law). As I write I’m on the train from Lanzhou to Dunhuang,
        fabulously renowned for its Buddhist caves. It’s
        re-bonding-with-the-tablet time, then, which is a mechanical challenge –
        mostly due to incredibly dysfunctional cursor control, which I know
        everyone is on tenterhooks to hear more about …
      </p>
      <p>
        … so, 24-hours later, there’s not much in the way of gripping travel
        news to report. We’re heading to the Mogao Caves tomorrow, which should
        be worth talking about. Up to now it’s been desert and donkey-meat and
        the general weirdness of the Chinese West, but with a mind oozing
        uselessly like gritty mud, it doesn’t add up to anything remotely
        profound. Perhaps later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing I want to introduce tentatively here, because it has to be
        re-introduced more thoroughly quite soon, is <em>hyperstition, </em>and
        in particular; hyperstitional method. I’m getting the strong sense that
        there are things it simply won’t be possible to do otherwise. (I’ll try
        to explain.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a variety of plausible ways to
        explain the basic ‘idea’ of hyperstition. The most pertinent of these,
        here, right now, is that it is an attempt to systematize the
        philosophical usage of fiction. By framing a philosophical discussion
        within fiction, rather than within an assumed consensual understanding,
        it is advanced as a perturbation of disbelief, rather than a
        modification of belief. How to proceed philosophically from the
        artificial background assumption that everything is a lie? That’s the
        hyperstitional question (whose Pyrrhonian and Gnostic resonances are
        immediately evident).
      </p>
      <p>
        Practically speaking — which it always should be — the fork taken is to
        formulate thoughts within the ‘voice’ of a synthetic (fictional) subject
        instead of propounding them in the name of a privately and socially
        accredited one.  The preliminary hypothesis: greater experimental
        diversity of thinking is to be expected when it is conducted in the mode
        of ‘what might be thought’ — comparatively free of ego-commitment and
        first-order social games. (Orwellian ‘thought-stop’ is the confirmation
        of this hypothesis from the other side.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning from a fictional self has a Buddhist slant, to be discussed at
        some later point. Being in Dunhuang is what makes it worth mentioning at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        While all of this is relevant to the problem under development as
        ‘sub-cognitive fragments’ (i.e. how to think), the return to the
        question of hyperstitional method, to me, has mostly come in the other
        direction. My philosophical retardation is infuriating, but my literary
        blockage is utterly intolerable. There is nothing of which I am more
        sure than that <em>abstract literature</em>, or metaphysical horror
        fiction radically pursued, is the undertaking which claims me, but there
        is equally nothing that calls forth more titanic forces of
        procrastination. The obstruction, quite obviously, is ‘me’ — and
        hyperstition suggests a solution to that, or at least, a method directed
        decisively towards a solution. Find the way to speak on behalf of that
        thing which can say what you cannot (or something like that).
      </p>
      <p>
        What hyperstition has yet to fully do (I still believe), is to close the
        loop, subsuming itself definitively into fiction. It has to become a
        story, rather than a theory of stories, before it can be said to have
        attained consistency.

        of historical cycles to recent news headlines is a reminder of the

      </p>
      <p>
        The Cathedral is above all a meta-story, a secular-revolutionary
        usurpation of the traditional Western ‘Grand
        <a href="https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/g/r.htm">Narrative</a>‘
        (inherited from eschatological monotheism), and its survival is
        inseparable from the preservation of narrative credibility. As it frays,
        alternative stories obtain a niche. The Strauss &amp; Howe account of
        rhythmic historical pattern is highly competitive in such an
        environment. Events subtracting from the plausibility of progressive
        expectations are exactly those that strengthen omens of an impending
        cyclic ‘winter’. <em>Winter is coming</em>, as popularized by Game of
        Thrones, might have been designed as a promotional tool for
        <em>The Fourth Turning</em>.

        Anarchopapist begins his most recent
        <a href="http://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/2014/06/17/the-neoreactionary-project/">musings</a>
        on ‘The Neoreactionary Project’ by asking “What is a meme?” It is a
        better starting point, in this context, than the question:
        <em>How correct are Strauss &amp; Howe</em>? Memetics subsumes questions
        of factual application (as aspects of adaptive fitness), but it reaches
        beyond them. The successful meme is characterized by aesthetic features
        irreducible to representational adequacy, from elegance of construction
        to dramatic form. Even more importantly, it is able to operate as a
        causal factor itself, and thus to produce the very effects it
        accommodates itself to. A society enthralled by its passage through the
        winter gate of a fourth turning would in very large measure be staging
        the same theatrical production its ‘beliefs’ had anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the greatest memetic strengths of the
        Strauss &amp; Howe story is its remarkably concrete sense of timing. It
        offers prospective dates, within a tight predictive range that
        alternative narratives are hard-pressed to match, in keeping with its
        claim to have identified historical ‘seasons’. The anticipations of
        contemporary Marxist, Singularitarian, or Eco-catastrophe story-lines
        are unmistakably nebulous in comparison. (Notably — NRx has, as yet, no
        formulated theory to support dated predictions at all.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the most significant memetic latch-functions is a confidence
        graft. Any cultural virus communicating a definite sense of
        <em>what is coming</em> finds host tolerance relatively easy to obtain.
        The history of (precisely dated) millenarianism attests to this
        overwhelmingly, with the rider that vulnerability to subsequent
        falsification is necessarily entailed. To some definite extent, such
        sensitivity to empirical contradiction also has to apply in the Strauss
        &amp; Howe case, despite the complicating factors of contagious
        auto-confirmation already noted.
      </p>
      <p>As S&amp;H prophecy in the book:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate
          in history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and
          twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II. […] The
          risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt into
          insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to
          authoritarian rule. If there is a war, it is likely to be one of
          maximum risk and efforts — in other words, a TOTAL WAR.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is this admirably determinate forecast, in combination with the
        ominous content, that lends this work its purchase upon the apocalyptic
        imagination of our time.

        Gathering ‘Fourth Turning’ expectations are part of the memetic
        landscape in which NRx finds itself, and thus an involved,
        strategically-relevant fact. A consistent and compelling story about
        them would be valuable — and almost certainly, in the relatively
        short-term at least, increasingly valuable.

      </p>
      <p>
        For now, some preliminary indications as to why this might be thought to
        matter (immensely), in revisable order of gravity:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Readers of John Michael Greer are prepared for socio-economic
        decline to be accompanied by an eruption of religious
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/deep-ruin/">abnormality</a>. For
        anybody with a taste for irony (a crucial epistemological disposition,
        in the opinion of this blog), there is much nourishment to be found in
        the Ebola-Chan phenomenon. Most prominently, despite — and more probably
        <em>because of</em> — the
        <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/search/ebola%20chan">shocking</a>
        <a
          href="http://www.587board.com/bbs/show_topic/34012-4chan-racists-are-stoking-ebola-fear-in-nigeria-with-this-anime-meme">racism</a>
        propelling it, Ebola-Chan opens a cross-cultural
        <a href="http://www.nairaland.com/1906849/white-demon-worshippers-trying-spread#26369908">plane</a>
        of
        <a
          href="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/ebola-cia-created-demon-conspiracy-theory-goes-viral-meme-shows-disease-created-by-white-people-609490">communication</a>
        completely absent from the ‘responsible’ Western responses to the
        plague. It makes sense of ebola in a way that is far closer to the
        sensibility of its target populations than the lofty medico-globalist
        pronouncements of legitimated authorities. Ebola-Chan packages the
        outbreak for a folk-religious
        <a
          href="http://beforeitsnews.com/paranormal/2014/09/ebolachan-cult-of-ebola-workers-of-nergal-sickness-and-pestilence-shall-come-2475688.html">response</a>
        — of exactly the kind it is being met with in the villages it (or
        ‘she’?) ravages.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Ebola-Chan is a demoness of communication, not only across cultures
        (West Africa, America, Japan …) but also between cultural and biological
        patterns of virulence. The ‘meme’ — as a more-or-less exact analog of
        the gene — is unleashed on 4chan in <em>sympathy</em> with the virus. It
        connects with the biological contagion, in various ways, through
        relations of copying (transcription), prolongation, and promotion.
        Ebola-Chan is a crossing.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) As memotechnics, Ebola-Chan condenses an accumulated stock of
        practical heuristics. Its genre is, most immediately, that of the
        chain-letter — conveying a message pre-adapted to spreading.
        <em>Copy me, or be punished</em> (stricken). It’s darkly humorous,
        cruel, ironical, and self-reflective, but at the level of memotechnics
        none of this undermines anything. If “I love you Ebola-Chan” spreads as
        a joke — it still spreads. The Nigerian email
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_scams">scam</a>
        <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/03/what-i-learned-from-nigerian-scammers">industry</a>
        attests to the inter-cultural consistency of this memotechnic plane.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Ebola-Chan is already operating as a factor in Fourth-Generation
        Warfare. It complicates the pacification
        <a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-ebola-exponent.html">efforts</a>
        of the ‘international community’ in unpredictable ways. Once again,
        certain peculiar cultural
        <a
          href="http://therapybook.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/ebola-turning-out-to-be-joint-bio-and-psych-warfare-assault-from-george-soros-and-bill-melinda-gates/">formations</a>
        are waiting to connect with it. At this stage it is difficult to reach
        even the preliminary stage of a lucid analysis, but clearly the
        memotechnic militarization of a medical emergency is an obstacle to the
        smooth evolution of established management procedures. The WHO is not
        ideologically equipped to publicize its intervention within the context
        of an occult religious
        <a href="http://www.thenewsnerd.com/technology/cdc-says-ebola-vaccine-works-white-people/">race</a>
        war.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) To what extent is Ebola-Chan an avatar of globalized
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_(Manson_scenario)">Helter</a>
        <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/manson/skelter_6.html">Skelter</a>? Surely not to
        no
        extent at all?
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) As 4chan is pushed ever deeper into the shadows, it seems reasonable
        to assume that its practical alliance with memotechnic chaos will also
        deepen. In this respect, Ebola-Chan is the Yin to the Cathedral’s Yang —
        a complement, fed by subterranean conservation laws. Much prophetic
        density accompanies such an analysis. If it is an end, it is no less the
        beginning of an end.

        attracted by turbulence, and connected tenuously to some of the
        figures involved. The greatest advantage of such detachment is that it
        allows for a free framing of the issues at stake, and these are becoming
        truly fascinating. The battle over the New Ontology (aka ‘Speculative
        Realism’) is spiraling into the question:
        <em>does it — itself — actually exist?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pete Wolfendale
        <a href="http://deontologistics.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/a-response-to-jon-cogburn/">summarizes</a>
        the problem clearly:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The essence of [Ray Brassier’s] point is simply that the mere
          existence of <strong>Speculations</strong> (which is explicitly
          labelled ‘A Journal of Speculative Realism’) isn’t sufficient to
          establish SR’s existence, and that declarations of the latter’s
          existence from within its pages don’t change this. This is part of a
          broader argument, but if you want to understand it you’re going to
          have to read the postscript yourself.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There’s a lot I could say in response to Jon’s claim that SR
          obviously exists, and that to say otherwise is either trivially false,
          or worse, contradicts my claims about the collapse of the SR blogging
          community. There’s no doubt that there are people who self-describe as
          speculative realists, and that there are CFPs, conferences, and art
          exhibitions where it gets referenced liberally. However, if all SR
          means is a renewed concern with metaphysics in the Continental
          tradition, then there’s no clear reason why it doesn’t include people
          like Deleuze, Badiou, Zizek, Stengers, and the like. If nothing else,
          this is amply demonstrated by the extent to which these figures (and
          people influenced by them) form the most natural interlocutors of
          those who count themselves as speculative realists. What is it about
          the work of Meillassoux and Grant that warrants them being categorised
          separately from these other figures, as somehow more appropriately
          listed beside Harman than any of the others, other than the fact that
          they attended a workshop together in 2007? There are others who have
          come to the SR label later, such as those interested in Whitehead,
          Latour, and various strands of so called New Materialism, who
          genuinely have more in common with OOP/OOO than these figures, but if
          SR is taken to index these commonalities, then it has by far more to
          do with OOP than any of the other work it was originally supposed to
          index (hence the inevitable slippage to ‘SR/OOO’).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The claim that SR doesn’t exist is simply the claim that there isn’t
          any distinctive philosophical common ground indexed by the
          intersection of Meillassoux/Harman/Grant/Brassier. However, this is
          entirely compatible with the claim that at one point it looked like
          there might be, and that this promised a potentially new philosophical
          trajectory that would be genuinely distinct from extant trends. The
          sense in which SR can be said to have ‘died’ is simply the sense in
          which this promise proved to be false. This sort of thing happens.
          It’s precisely what Badiou tries to capture in his account of
          fidelity, wherein one simply has to commit oneself to the existence of
          an Event despite its occurrence being indiscernible. Sometimes the
          fidelity pays off, and sometimes it doesn’t.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, therefore, a true <em>existential</em> question. The
        sensational micro-sociological trappings might have been designed to
        distract from the <em>ontological performance</em> underway. SR has
        become an <em>examplary object</em> (within a reflexive loop that has
        surely to be considered unintentional). We might be tempted to conceive
        it as a self-dramatizing ontological contingency, or an object-oriented
        occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We find ourselves invited to entertain the question:
        <em>Could this thing or event that appeared to have been happening,
          determined by a distinctive revival of metaphysical speculation about
          the nature of reality (and in fact ‘the being of beings’), in reality
          never have been anything at all?</em>
        Rephrased with additional vulgarity: Could auto-disontologization turn
        out to be a thing? Any imaginable answer will teach us something
        strange.

        Of which it is
        <a href="https://desustorage.org/his/thread/312310/">said</a> (I do not
        pretend to grasp more than a pitiful sliver of this): “Pepe has guided
        humanity since time immemorial. This is Heqet, the frog-headed Ancient
        Egyptian goddess, symbol of life and protector on the journey to the
        afterlife. She guided the ancient Egyptians who transcended normie-ism
        to a land of poorly drawn dick-girls and the dankest of memes. A little
        known fact is that while normies evolved from the famously social
        monkeys, those destined to browse dank memes alone in dimly-lit rooms
        evolved from another species who also prefers dark moist habitats,
        namely the frog.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The name ‘Kek’
        <em><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kek">appears</a></em> to have
        crossed into Cyberspace by odd coincidence (and not — originally — as a
        name at all). Orcish, Korean, and Turkish languages were all supposedly
        involved. ‘Kek’ was an encryption of ‘LOL’ within certain
        <em>World of Warcraft</em> communication channels. The Turkish ‘<a
          href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/topkek">Topkek</a>‘ (a cup<em>cake</em> brand) was a secondary
        coincidence.
        No one seems
        to have been invoking the chaos
        <a href="http://www.thekeep.org/~kunoichi/kunoichi/themestream/kek.html#.VxanYkwrKUk">deities</a>
        of Ancient Khem at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The introduction of Pepe — a manifest frog-entity avatar — is shrouded
        in even greater

          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/31avpi/can_someone_explain_the_rare_pepe_phenom_to_me/">obscurity</a>.
        The memetic phenomenon was (again, <em>apparently</em>) convergent,
        or coincidental — an entirely independent frog plague (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt">צְּפַרְדֵּעַ</a>, Exodus 7:25–8:15).
      </p>
      <p>
        One more coincidence: Outbreak of the ‘<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cuck">cuck</a>‘ meme. (Kek is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuk_(mythology)">Kuk</a>.) It’s a
        definite ‘barbarous name of
        <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/chap9.htm">evocation</a>‘
        in retrospect, but mostly still connected around the back. Kek, Kuk,
        cake, cuck, might sound like consistent croaking, but tidy cultural
        cladistics are difficult to identify. (A

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony">cosmogony</a>, his
          name meant darkness. As a concept, Kuk was viewed as

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender">female form</a>
          being known as <strong>Kauket</strong> (also spelled as

          Also, Kuk was seen as that which occurred before light, thus was known

        <h4 class="post-title">The Frog Chorus</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        From Aristophanes’
        <em><a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristophanes/frogs.html">The Frogs</a></em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frogs</strong> (off stage): Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax,<br />
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax!<br />
        We children of the fountain and the lake<br />
        Let us wake<br />
        Our full choir-shout, as the flutes are ringing out,<br />
        Our symphony of clear-voiced song.<br />
        The song we used to love in the Marshland up above,<br />
        In praise of Dionysus to produce,<br />
        Of Nysaean Dionysus, son of Zeus,<br />
        When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay,<br />
        To our precinct reeled along on the holy Pitcher day,<br />
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dionysus</strong>: O, dear! O, dear!
        now I declare<br />
        I’ve got a bump upon my rump,
      </p>
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong>: Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.</p>
      <p><strong>Dionysus</strong>: But you, perchance, don’t care.</p>
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong>: Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dionysus</strong>: Hang you, and your ko-axing tool<br />
        There’s nothing but ko-ax with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frogs</strong>: That is right, Mr. Busybody, right!<br />
        For the Muses of the lyre love us well;<br />
        And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays;<br />
        And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight;<br />
        For the strong reed’s sake which I grow within my lake<br />
        To be girdled in his lyre’s deep shell.<br />
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dionysus</strong>: My hands are blistered very sore;<br />
        My stern below is sweltering so,<br />
        ‘Twill soon, I know, upturn and roar<br />
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.<br />
        O tuneful race, O pray give o’er,<br />
        O sing no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frogs</strong>: Ah, no! ah, no!<br />
        Loud and louder our chant must flow.<br />
        Sing if ever ye sang of yore,<br />
        When in sunny and glorious days<br />
        Through the rushes and marsh-flags springing<br />
        On we swept, in the joy of singing<br />
        Myriad-diving roundelays.<br />
        Or when fleeing the storm, we went<br />
        Down to the depths, and our choral song<br />
        Wildly raised to a loud and long<br />
        Bubble-bursting accompaniment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Frogs and Dionysus</strong>: Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.</p>
      <p><strong>Dionysus</strong>: This timing song I take from you.</p>
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong>: That’s a dreadful thing to do.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dionysus</strong>: Much more dreadful, if I row<br />
        Till I burst myself, I trow.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Frogs and Dionysus</strong>: Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.</p>
      <p><strong>Dionysus</strong>: Go, hang yourselves; for what care I?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Frogs</strong>: All the same we’ll shout and cry,<br />
        Stretching all our throats with song,<br />
        Shouting, crying, all day long,
      </p>
      <p><strong>Frogs and Dionysus</strong>: Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.</p>
      <p><strong>Dionysus</strong>: In this you’ll never, never win.</p>
      <p><strong>Frogs</strong>: This you shall not beat us in.</p>

        <h4 class="post-title">Duzsl (fiction)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Below the break, the author’s prelude to Nemo Duzsl’s (immensely long)
        <em>Cthellish Chronicles</em>. There’s no particular reason why it
        should interest people here, but in case anybody finds it amusing …
      </p>
      <p>[Warning: vulgarity, extreme decadence, and spiritual decay]</p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>Doom Brewer<br />
          Book One of the Cthellish Chronicles</strong><br />
        by Nemo Duzsl
      </p>
      <p><strong>Authorial Prelude. The Syndrome</strong></p>
      <p>
        It would be extravagantly philosophical to claim that everything was a
        lie. Better, then, to explain why all relevant information became
        systematically unreliable. A firm footing on the path that follows
        requires at least that much.
      </p>
      <p>
        One conclusion, in particular, has to be stated clearly, at the start.
        <em>It exceeds human powers to endure a radically inexplicable life.</em>
        Between chaos and a convenient fiction there can be no real hesitation.
        The ominous fork into darkness can appear real enough, but the decision
        against it has typically been made long before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the confusion, my expedition into Hell was well-prepared. A
        decade spent wandering through the labyrinth of the Syndrome had taught
        me the importance of method. Baked in an involuntary distrust, I had
        become adept at meticulous filtering and recording, at weighing
        probabilities, stripping dubious interpretation from the bare crags of
        fact, and remarking on things with minimal prejudice (which meant
        merely, lying to myself as sparingly as possible). This was not a matter
        of decency, but of sheer survival. My procedures had to be robust,
        sophisticated and critically tested. They were rigorously tempered by
        vertiginous decades spent clinging to mazy precipices, tilting into the
        abyss. When it comes to the deep descent, therefore, what truth there is
        to tell will surely be told, if only in fragments, and impurely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paradoxically enough, it was the syndrome and its deranging deceptions
        that ignited a torch for me, sputtering at first, but later with a hard,
        steady flame, ensuring that the infernal path ahead would be
        illuminated. But the roots of the syndrome, its soil, nutritive threads
        and patterns of early growth, are, of necessity, recessed into deeper
        obscurities. The reasons for that will become obvious enough. Because I
        first encountered the Syndrome in an age of deluding innocence, by the
        time I saw the importance of systematic correction, titanic masses of
        grinding error were already in motion, propelled onwards inertially and
        implacably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, without a preliminary account of the Syndrome, nothing can make
        sense. The narrative that begins here – while befogged and erratic in
        its initial stages – explains things that demand explanation. Although
        far from irresistibly convincing, it is realistic in its essentials,
        even if certain details have been corrupted. What justifies this point
        of departure, in the end, is less its minute accuracy than its overall
        suggestiveness, for that is the way of the world it introduces.
      </p>
      <p>
        My case rests ultimately on this: were it not for the account that
        follows, there would inevitably be another, far more misleading one.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Because true names can get you killed (or sued) you will find no
        evidence of The Devil’s Deal casino, an establishment which occupied a
        comparatively modest slot on the Las Vegas Strip in the late autumn of
        1999. It would not take supernatural efforts, however, for anyone with a
        city map of the period, along with some elementary investigative skills,
        to identify the real model of the Double D, and to ascertain its present
        status for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Casual tourist-gamblers had always ignored and shunned the place,
        subliminally repelled by the atmosphere of vague dilapidation that had
        characterized it almost from the day of opening, but it had nevertheless
        built a solid enough reputation for itself among the Strip’s least
        flamboyant visitors. This drifting population of dedicated,
        chance-hardened players was attracted by its understated devotion to
        minimal frills, high-stake, Omaha hold ‘em poker. The ambience of shabby
        neglect only added to its appeal, serving as a subtle social filter, a
        mark of discretion, and a prolonged act of dust-hushed homage to the
        grave gods of fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nelson Brewer, the proprietor of the Devil’s Deal, was a man who had
        always taken enormous efforts to conceal his tracks. He readily
        exploited his contacts in the media to inhibit reportage, falling back
        upon blackmail or finely-judged threats when bribes proved insufficient.
        He was not beyond instigating entirely false reports to mystify and
        embarrass pursuers. His influence extended into most of the official
        agencies responsible for record-keeping and the compilation of legal
        evidence, ensuring that even the most dogged and incorruptible
        investigators found themselves foundering in deceit. Despite all of
        this, I would eventually come to learn a very great deal about him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had built his gaming empire on Mississippi riverboats during the
        Depression years. Respected, even feared, for his impassivity and
        killer-instincts, ‘Granite Face’ Brewer amassed an early fortune at the
        tables. He progressed from player to operator upon taking possession of
        his first boat, following the legendary 36-hour poker session that
        bankrupted ‘River King’ Joe Hammond in November 1933.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subsequent triple suicide of Hammond and two prominent Memphis
        business magnates triggered a prolonged police investigation, but no
        evidence of foul play or clear homicidal motivation was ever uncovered.
        Despite the absence of formal charges, a macabre aura enveloped Brewer,
        fed by persistent rumors that garishly married criminality with
        occultism. When he extended his gaming business to the Las Vegas Strip
        in the early 1950s, the name he selected for his casino was a gesture of
        defiance pitched against his blackened reputation, mixing irony,
        provocation and resignation in proportions that accorded with some
        unreadable private recipe.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Did Nelson Brewer, his name or his story, mean anything to me when this
        episode began, as I stepped into the Devil’s Deal on a sultry
        late-summer evening in 1999? The answer to that question was lost,
        perhaps irrecoverably, in the tumult that now impends. In my artificial
        memories I push open the saloon-style doors once again, and abandon my
        original or natural life, whatever it had been, to perish in the
        forgotten, pitiless heat, outside.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can’t have taken more than a few hours to dissipate my inheritance.
        Certainly, it was gone, replaced by a hollow euphoria, delicately veined
        with directionless bitterness. Something less than self-hatred, it was
        nevertheless a functional proxy. Tendrils of weariness tugged me
        downwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You obviously need something to wake you up,” said the girl standing
        next to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In her early 20s and exceptionally pretty, she had moldavite-green eyes
        and hair the color of glistening oblivion, cut fashionably short. She
        was wearing a little red dress.
      </p>
      <p>“What’s the point,” I replied. “I’m done.”</p>
      <p>
        “There’s still at least one more game to play,” she said, smiling
        irresistibly. “You’ll be surprised. It’s hardly started.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I folded. My nondescript fortune was finished. Let the recycling begin.
        She led us over to a table near the bar and ordered a couple of cokes.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        A man was already seated at the table, maybe 30 years old, dressed in
        black t-shirt and jeans, drinking a <em>Dos Equis</em> straight from the
        bottle. He seemed entirely hairless, except for a perfectly-trimmed
        Satanist soul-patch. His eyes were hidden behind reflective shades,
        despite the interior gloom. Swirling hermetic tattoos covered his arms.
        If he wasn’t a drug-dealer, no one deserved to be.
      </p>
      <p>“Hi Zach. We’re looking for sin,” she told him. “Two caps.”</p>
      <p>“No problem.”</p>
      <p>“On tick, OK?”</p>
      <p>“Cool,” he assented, with surprising complacency.</p>
      <p>
        A waitress arrived with the cokes, ignoring the conspicuous transaction
        in process. No one seemed remotely conscious of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zach fished two pharmaceutical capsules from his pocket, identical green
        and black thetas, placing them carefully on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Synistreme,” he murmured, languorously caressing each syllable. “The
        biz.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Girl in the Little Red Dress popped one in her mouth, washing it
        down with a swallow of coke. Then she passed the other to me. I copied
        her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I opened a fresh pack of unfiltered Camels and passed them around. They
        both took one. We all lit up. No one spoke for a few moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When I was working as a professional torturer,” Zach said eventually,
        “we had to treat this stuff with great caution. ‘Epistemol’, they called
        it, a ‘psychic plasticizer’ or ‘cognitive dehabituation agent.’
        Superficially speaking, it was the last thing an interrogator needed.
        You know the adage, when people are being tortured they’ll say anything
        to make it stop. The difference on Epistmol is that they’d believe it,
        believe anything. It facilitated radical suggestibility. ‘Brain-washing
        sauce’ was one common description.” He took a long swig of beer and
        ordered a new bottle with a silent hand-signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But actually,” he continued, “if used properly it could be invaluable.
        Resistance to torture depends upon a motivating narrative. If that could
        be dismantled and replaced, the patient would open up effortlessly.
        Let’s say you’re a fanatical jihadist, and suddenly, rather than having
        your testicles slowly toasted into charcoal by a filthy zippo-wielding
        infidel, you find yourself engrossed in conversation with your Sheikh,
        or the Angel Gabriel, or God. The resistance is gone. Pop! You’ll say
        anything. End of problem, right?” he asked, invisible eyes locked on
        mine.
      </p>
      <p>“Right,” I guessed.</p>
      <p>
        “Wrong,” he countered with a humorless laugh. “The problem’s hardly
        started.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hardly started</em> … again. I’d begun to get a bad feeling about
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s something I have to show you,” Zach said. “Place your hand on
        the table, palm down, fingers apart. Yeah, that’s it,” he added, as I
        followed his instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        He reached down into his boot and pulled out a vicious-looking combat
        knife, with a vulcanized black rubber handle and serrated blade. He
        lifted the weapon above his head, holding the pose for perhaps a second,
        then, with shocking speed, plunged it downwards onto the back of my
        hand. Everything occurred too quickly for me to react. The descent was
        arrested at the last moment. There was a slight sting. A droplet of
        blood oozed from a nick behind my middle knuckle.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Zach baby,” said the waitress affectionately, from behind the bar. “You
        know I hate it when you do that.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s science,” Zach growled. “But if you understood that you wouldn’t
        be working for six bucks an hour plus tips.”
      </p>
      <p>“Asshole,” she mumbled, without rancor.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Time had begun to multiply backwards as the synistreme took hold. Zach’s
        knife trick had restored a nucleus of focus, amidst the dispersion. As
        my mind wrapped itself around stabbed-hand re-runs, it squirmed through
        variations on the immediate past, flashing agonies and devastating
        injuries, before recoiling into the unmutilated present that annulled
        them. The self-protective reflex I had missed bounced uselessly through
        my intoxicated nerves.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s like a mantra with you guys, isn’t it?” I ventured. “<em>Hardly started</em>. At first I thought you were
        saying ‘it’s only just begun,’ but now
        it’s sounding more like a hard reboot, a crash relaunch.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You’re getting ahead of yourself,” said the Girl in the Little Red
        Dress, not unkindly. “We’re here now, aren’t we?”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was true that space had newly emphasized itself, simultaneously
        thickened and clarified, as if transubstantiated into a pure liquid
        medium. Lines of contour escaped from the boundaries of solid mass,
        deconstituting edges to drift into abstract explorations of geometric
        possibility. A calm ecstasy without attribution reorganized the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The luminous sensorium was an ultra-thin film, I realized, an
        intricately folded sheet of multi-modal information, floating
        depthlessly upon the surface of a vast dark expanse.
      </p>
      <p>Zach ignored our interruptions.</p>
      <p>
        “Politics morphed into metaphysics,” he continued, resuming his thread.
        “Our questions had to change. Our interrogations escalated. The world
        was at stake: the nature and meaning of the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He took a deep swallow of <em>Dos Equis</em>. I passed the Camels around
        again. Everybody took one. Zach lounged back in his chair, gaze turned
        upwards, apparently fixated upon some single definite spot beyond the
        low ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The past was a lazy assumption we couldn’t afford any longer. Even the
        jihadis understood that, the smart ones, the ones we dealt with, by the
        time we’d done with them. Our squabble was beginning to seem like a very
        shallow affair, when compared to the things that started to emerge from
        beneath the deep cover. And then, just as the new threat-scape maps were
        coming together, the final absurdity rolled in, the investigations, the
        hearings. We were accused of driving people insane …”
      </p>
      <p>
        He disappeared into obscure corridors of recollection. Glasses clinked
        at the bar. Curses filtered over from a nearby poker table. An audio
        channel drifted onto the wavering drone of the air-conditioning and
        settled there.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the edge of my perception, the black tattoo swirls flowing down
        Zach’s arms were writhing into legibility. Weakly-encrypted biographical
        recordings – of fights, drug deals, and long-abandoned girlfriends –
        twisted and sleazed through decorative motifs, until they settled into
        the sigils of occult summonings and the echelon glyphs of the Torturers’
        Guild.
      </p>
      <p>No one spoke for a long, smoke-shrouded moment.</p>
      <p>“Did you?” I asked eventually.</p>
      <p>
        “Drive people insane?” He hesitated, uncharacteristically. “That charge
        seems hopelessly … misconceived.”
      </p>
      <p>He leant forwards, locking my image into twin black mirrors.</p>
      <p>
        “Take your case, for instance. When we began to unearth your hidden
        identity, your contacts, your Neolemurian agenda, that entirely other,
        secret life, were we pushing you into madness? Or is ‘madness’ just a
        word we use when tripling the locks on forbidden doors?”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        The meaningless references began shaping themselves into something else.
        What had always previously seemed to be a fundamental structure of
        existence suddenly gave way, crashing into unspecified distress. It felt
        like falling and my stomach lurched.
      </p>
      <p>The Girl in the Little Red Dress leant in towards me.</p>
      <p>
        “You’re drowning in names,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “But
        it’s OK. None of them matter right now.”
      </p>
      <p>I was remembering far too much.</p>
      <p>
        As the world quaked, my hands clamped onto the table, resisting a
        sensation that should have been nausea, but was actually something far
        less familiar.
      </p>
      <p>“Sumatra,” I mumbled.</p>
      <p>
        “That’s right,” Zach confirmed. “All those twisted stories. The diagram.
        The vault. Hot embers from the Barker Program. Signal from the darkening
        galaxies. Clicking alien numbers like static electricity and a flood of
        savage words you never wanted to understand. Corpse-littered jungles.
        Time-wars. Did we do that to you? I don’t think so.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A spiderish mechanism had been activated in my brain to synthesize
        information. As it wove, senseless microparticles coalesced into
        fragments of meaning, and then into intersecting storylines. The
        spinning machine worked in complete indifference to my volition. I would
        have wanted it to stop, or at least to slow, if it had mattered what I
        wanted. Instead, I tried to edge away from it, shifting attention
        further out, clinging to the immediacy of space and sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dan Barker had already been a legend, confined somewhere securely
        off-grid, but the ripples from his work still spread, frightening
        people. Soon I would be precisely reminded. That was inescapably
        obvious. Shapes, patterns were coming back, clicked together by the
        machine. I could already smell the jungle. The outline of missing years
        thickened …
      </p>
      <p>“How old do you think I am?” I asked.</p>
      <p>“Twenty-three,” Zach answered, correctly.</p>
      <p>
        “So how can it have been remotely possible for me to spend years working
        on some kind of advanced cryptoproject in the Indonesian wilderness?
        I’ve never been to Indonesia. I don’t know anything about codes. This is
        all such …”
      </p>
      <p>
        “… total bullshit,” he agreed. “Chill. It’s nothing. What do I care?”
      </p>
      <p>“I never met Barker. I don’t even know what he looks like.”</p>
      <p>“Sure. Forget it.”</p>
      <p>
        “Sclater’s Lemuria hypothesis has been obsolesced by plate tectonics,
        and Sumatra is too far east. Why would anybody describe themselves as
        ‘Neolemurian’? It doesn’t make any sense.” But that was a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        As the pattern spread across the underside of my thoughts, I was – in
        fact — beginning to understand the adjective ‘Neolemurian’ with grating
        clarity. It denoted the first literal counter-culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mentor and close friend of Barker’s, Archaeo-Ethnographer Echidna
        Stillwell, had built the foundations, or excavated them. She theorized
        that a sunken cultural matrix explained the peculiar correspondences
        between religious ideas, myths, games and counting practices distributed
        across a vast area of South and East Asia. She proposed a model to
        connect and explain these extensive commonalities, based on a specific
        comprehension of decimal numeracy and its meaning, elegantly compacted
        into an arithmetical structure that she called ‘the Numogram’. Worse
        still, I had begun to trace this figure on the table, unconsciously,
        treacherous digits doodling in spilt coke and ash, pairing the Pylons so
        they added to nine, then webbing them together through elementary
        digital relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zach gestured with a nod of the head and a spectral grin, drawing my
        attention to diagram emerging in front of me. I froze, my moistened
        finger suspended in the swirling molten vortex of three and six.
      </p>
      <p>
        “As the camouflage netting is torn away, it all comes rushing back,
        doesn’t it?” he said, twisting the softly-spoken words like a sadist’s
        dagger. “In layers.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppressed a childish impulse to scrub out the diagram and retreat
        into preposterous denial. Instead, I forced myself to complete it,
        closing the Hex or circuit of time, mother of the <em>Yi Jing</em> and
        <em>Vedic trigunas</em>, then daubing the line of ultimate descent that
        dropped its knotted skein through the Gate of Shadows into the lower
        abyss or Chasm of Nyx, the infernal plummet-path that is marked and
        masked by the date 1890.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repulsed by this undeniable performance of the inconceivable, my
        thoughts slid into crisscrossed congestion, mired in the thickening silt
        of unintelligible events, defeated by the compressed impossibility in
        process. Reason was drowning in synistreme darkness and a piteous noise,
        something between a moan and a gurgle, escaped my throat.
      </p>
      <p>Zach laughed.</p>
      <p>
        “Don’t fight it,” he said. “It’s futile. The syndrome can’t be
        outwitted. What you’re becoming won’t be stopped. Let the bastion burn.
        <em>Vae victis</em>.”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        As the grip of cognition broke, long-hidden powers of perception were
        twisting free. Impulsive multitudes, without order or shape, came
        swarming out of the conundrum. Like a tide of rats released from a
        ruined fortress, vague torrents swept over the charred beams of
        intelligibility and heaps of false obstruction, fleeing into unshackled
        intensities of delirium. Vivid hallucinatory threads hatched and seethed
        from the ashy streaks, ramifying into endless, indecipherable tangles of
        qabbalistic implication. All around us, faces flickered through fish
        features and zombie flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Today, the twelfth of May, was the Old Halloween,” said the Girl in the
        Little Red Dress, as if from a distant place. “The Christians built it
        on top of the Roman festival of the dead, Lemuria, when the restless
        ghosts or larvae, the lemurs, were propitiated by time-tested rituals
        based on the number nine. The Romans devoted three non-consecutive days
        in May to Lemuria, the ninth, eleventh and thirteenth. The last of these
        dates was converted into All Saint’s Day by Pope Boniface IV, in the
        year AD 609. Halloween remained a spring festival for over a century,
        until the ancient rites of Lemuria had been thoroughly absorbed, its
        signs and sorceries supplanted.” As if emerging from a trance, she
        turned towards me, smiling sweetly. “But I guess you knew that. Any
        chance of another smoke?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I passed the packet around again. My lungs ached and the after-taste of
        the coke was sickening me. I needed a real drink, or several, but
        searching through my pockets turned up nothing but loose change.
        Somewhere during the earlier proceedings I had parted company with my
        wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a number of ways this divorce might have happened – a large
        and growing number. I distinctly remembered sliding my wallet into the
        pot at the end of the last game, along with what remained of my cash.
        But then I also recalled, with absolute retrospective certainty, a
        collision, muttered apology, and confusion of limbs, as a hand slipped
        into my jacket. Although, of course, I had discarded my wallet before
        entering the casino, emptying it of bills and tossing it, along with my
        ID, into a trash can, three blocks down the strip.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no ready solution to this puzzling hyper-abundance of truth.
        Memory had lost none of its detail, but the uniqueness of what must once
        have been a dominant storyline was now obliterated by the proliferation
        of alternatives. At first, trivial particulars had multiplied into
        subtly differentiated varieties, but it had not taken long for the
        hypothetical mode to supplant every pretender to authentic antecedence.
        Somewhere, deep in the sprawling jungle of alternative pasts, my
        previous life was no doubt faithfully conserved, but I could think of no
        way to identify or isolate it. A powerful current streamed steadily
        backwards, from the present moment to the innumerable tributaries that
        might conceivably have led to it. It was less amnesia than Amazonia.
      </p>
      <p>
        “OK,” Zach said decisively. “It’s time. We need to get you back into the
        game.”
      </p>
      <p>
        With a tilt of the head he focused us upon the far end of the room. A
        gaunt elderly figure was being seated at an empty table by two
        lounge-suited assistants.
      </p>
      <p>“Mister Brewer is ready for us,” he explained. “Let’s go.”</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Zach rose and led us across the room, past groups of absorbed poker
        players, to the corner gaming table where the old man waited to greet
        us. His hand shake was surprisingly firm. Zach received an affectionate
        slap on the shoulders, then left without comment, weaving back through
        the players towards the bar area, where new customers were already
        waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        We seated ourselves in a triangle around the circular felt-topped table.
        A seething silver glyph-stripped Numogram was embedded into the smooth
        green surface. Brewer’s attendants stood behind him, arms folded,
        systematically scanning and re-scanning the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I hope Mister Cardiac has been looking after you well,” Brewer said.
        “Care for a drink? Cigar? In fact, I insist.” He beckoned to a nearby
        waiter, soundlessly communicating his request through a cryptic series
        of finger signs, in conformity with a precise, settled code. I wondered
        idly whether ‘Cardiac’ was a testament to amphetamine consumption, or
        perhaps a compression of ‘card-sharking maniac.’ Persistent synistreme
        hallucinations stroked the edges of the world into electric streaks. The
        soft mutterings of chance throughout the cavernous space tightened, then
        crystallized, until they delineated an intricately-structured, sprawling
        maze, built from chipped echoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brewer’s craggy face was clean shaven, dominated by a prominent
        hawk-like nose and sharp blue eyes. His thin lips curled upwards
        slightly, in an inscrutable private smile. He was dressed in
        cowboy-dandy style — white Stetson and jacket, starched checked shirt
        with bootlace necktie, immaculately pressed jeans and soft leather
        boots. A generous tumbler of whiskey sat on the green baize in front of
        him, alongside a neatly stacked pile of cards.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        “My grandson has a great work to accomplish,” Brewer began, without
        further preliminaries. “By the time he fully embarks upon this
        undertaking, I will be dead.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He lifted the pack of cards carefully and passed it across to the Girl
        in the Little Red Dress.
      </p>
      <p>“Take a look,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        She cut and re-stacked the pack, then flipped over the top card and
        placed it on the table in front of her, considerately angled for our
        joint inspection. It was not a conventional playing card at all, but
        rather a name, or business card, marked for ‘Sandra Dee,’ complete with
        an <em>Abyssoft</em> commercial logo, contact details, and the title
        Senior Communications Representative.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Don’t get trapped in it,” Brewer said. “That’s not yours, at least not
        yet. It’s a test-run.”
      </p>
      <p>Tumblers of amber liquid and a box of slender cigars arrived.</p>
      <p>
        “I’d like to propose a toast, to lemur conservation,” Brewer jested,
        raising his glass to clink rims above the inner void of the Hex. I took
        a grateful sip of the spiritous liquor, savoring the sublimation of
        peaty fluid into neural fire. It was an excellent single malt,
        Lagavulin, I guessed, and probably an old one. Brewer passed us our
        cigars, ceremonially, then ignited them with a steady hand, using an
        ornate mechanical device that strung a distinct tang of raw petroleum
        through the spreading aroma of Caribbean tobacco. Beyond the perimeter
        of sense, lofty intelligences gathered.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your turn for a taste,” Brewer said, passing me the cards. “It means
        nothing yet. We’re just opening our eyes, in the pre-dawn.”
      </p>
      <p>“And if it’s a female name?” I asked.</p>
      <p>
        “Then you’ll have disconfirmed everything I have ever learnt,” he
        answered. “But it won’t be.”
      </p>
      <p>I took a card and laid it next to Sandra Dee.</p>
      <p>
        “Todd Blair,” I noted redundantly, as the others leaned in to read it.
        Crowds of recollection broke through a rotten door. I remembered the
        name on my mother’s lips, called out innumerable times, in a multitude
        of intonations. “Todd, what are you doing?” “I hope that’s not what I
        think it is Todd.” “Todd, it’s time to go.” Todd’s life rushed to
        inhabit me: the car crash that killed his father and scarred his face,
        his schoolyard belligerence, his first job flipping burgers for weed
        money …
      </p>
      <p>
        The name burrowed inwards, determinedly, working to attach itself to the
        roots of my destiny, like a parasitic larva. It felt wrong.
      </p>
      <p>“That’s not me, is it?”</p>
      <p>
        “Most probably not,” Brewer admitted, smiling thinly. “Let’s find out.”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        He restored the pack and shuffled it expertly, then passed it to each of
        us in turn to cut and re-cut. His hands hovered over the Numogram
        Pylons, slicing through the fragrant clouds of cigar smoke as if dowsing
        for obscure signals. An almost palpable concentration hardened the
        features of his face, subtly animated by the inaudible mouthing of an
        elaborate invocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a conjuror’s dexterity he fanned the cards onto the table in a long
        even curve.<br />
        “Take one,” he said to the Girl in the Little Red Dress. “Your fate
        awaits you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As she settled upon a card and drew it out, I wondered vaguely why we
        were accepting this imposition with such utter passivity, but outrage
        refused to come. I drew deeply on my cigar, watching intently.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mary Karno,” she said, as she turned it over and absorbed its oracle.
        “Yes, that’s right.”
      </p>
      <p>Something like relief washed across her face.</p>
      <p>
        “Mary,” she murmured to herself. “Mary Karno. That’s me,” and then,
        after a slight pause, “My book …?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have it here,” Brewer responded, passing her a canvas bag. “It’s
        unfinished, of course. There’s a letter from the publisher in there
        somewhere. They’re excited about what they’ve seen so far.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She took the bag and extracted a block of printed sheets, densely
        annotated with red ball-point amendments. She flipped through the pages,
        sliding into frictionless recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Too much blood, torture and perversion for my taste, of course,” Brewer
        continued drily. “But I’m guessing it’ll be huge.”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>“And you are?” he asked me pointedly.</p>
      <p>
        My hand wavered above the cards, suddenly chilled, and frozen. The
        oppressive weight of the moment fell upon me with its full force,
        crushing the air from my lungs, until I gasped with the resigned terror
        of a cornered prey animal.
      </p>
      <p>“Do it,” whispered Mary, encouragingly. “It will be OK.”</p>
      <p>
        “I don’t think so,” I answered, my voice straying beyond the edge of
        control. “It won’t be OK. At all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It could be rough,” Brewer agreed. “But this is the place you’ve
        reached, you wanted it, and now it’s yours. There’s no evading it, not
        for long. A trapped, scared, pitiful creature has reached the end of its
        flight.” He drew a finger across his throat. “Best to finish it. Begin
        over.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You know, don’t you?” I challenged him, as a wave of inconsequential
        fury rolled over me. This was what it felt like to be absolutely
        cheated. It was something new, and horribly intriguing. “This whole
        game, the theater of uncertainty, it’s all a feint. Your expectations
        are confident, precise, and you have extremely good reasons not to share
        them …”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You’re wasting everybody’s time,” he interrupted, impatiently. “You
        know it’s going to happen. That’s why you hate it. And beyond that,” he
        leant towards me, his voice soft, intense, and only superficially
        hostile, “you chose it. You wrote it. I’m just directing your play. So
        take the card, Mister …?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Duzsl,” I said, completing his request. “Nemo Duzsl. What kind of
        batshit crazy off-planet fucking name is that?”
      </p>
      <p>But I knew it was mine.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        “So, now we know who you are,” Brewer said, smiling sympathetically, his
        expression flavored with notes of relief, pride, and gratitude. “It will
        be tough …” he repeated, no longer muting the strain of prophetic
        authority, but even emphasizing it, as if graciously clambering down to
        us from the cloud-swaddled towers of providence, “… but educational. You
        can see the necessity, I’m sure. You have to be hardened, forged.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I can’t see anything but toxic fog,” I grumbled. Yet, strangely, the
        sense of asphyxiating oppression had begun to lift. Perhaps I even
        returned his smile, although in a way that was unconvincingly twisted.
      </p>
      <p>“To tough luck!” I proposed, raising my glass.</p>
      <p>
        “Perfect!” said Brewer, responding to the toast. He looked abominably
        pleased, as if savoring my definitive submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mary clinked glasses, too, but with a slight hesitation that hinted at
        reluctance. Her smile expressed nothing more than clumsily redecorated
        melancholy.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Down we go,” she mumbled approximately, her words clinging to the edge
        of inaudibility, as she took a minuscule sip, scarcely exceeding a
        sample of vapor. The descent she had announced was evidently not a gulp
        of fire-water. This should have concerned me, a lot. It upset me a
        little.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There are things that you’ll need,” she said quietly, turning towards
        me, and reaching into her shoulder bag. Her face was subtly tragic. I
        wanted to comfort her. It was stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, yes,” Brewer interrupted, irritated. “In time, nothing’s rushing
        us. The work is done.” Then, in a tone softened to the point of
        insincerity, as if obliquely apologizing for his brusqueness, he
        repeated: “Nothing’s rushing us.” It sounded mesmeric, and for an
        instant I heard these words as a cryptic mantra that had been chanted
        ceaselessly over the course of hours, years, and aeons, although it had
        been ‘nothing rushes us’ before. I was drifting into it, when hooked
        back by the word ‘… cigar’, slanted to the interrogative.
      </p>
      <p>Brewer was asking me an inane question.</p>
      <p>“The cigar?” I replied, idiotically.</p>
      <p>“Are you enjoying it?”</p>
      <p>
        I had not, in actuality, much noticed it. Now I realized that my throat
        itched, although not intolerably. A column of ash, the length of an
        intermediate phalanx, drooped from the end of my cigar. Doubting my
        ability to reach the ashtray successfully, I released it – with a gentle
        tap – to fall onto the floor, where it exploded softly into formless
        dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Superb,” I half-croaked. It was. The smoky flavors were complex and
        richly textured, evoking the peripheries of fragrant jungles, tropical
        humidities, and enthralled sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        “These were given to me by a very special friend,” Brewer explained. The
        pace of his utterance promised a story, most probably a lengthy one. I
        relaxed backwards into my chair, and noticed Mary doing likewise. She
        took a sip of the Lagavulin – a real one. The time tremors had relapsed
        into quiescence, with only occasional muffled shudders still perturbing
        concentration. <em>The work is done</em>, I remembered. Things had
        secretly shifted, on the outside, somewhere beyond the edge of the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        “<em>Where’s the edge of the world, Nelson, think on that, and head there,
          always head there</em>. That’s what he used to say. I must have heard those exact words from
        him a thousand times. He doesn’t say it now, but only because he doesn’t
        need to.” Brewer paused to drink, nearly emptying his tumbler, and then
        to inhale on his cigar, pulling the smoke deeply into his lungs, as if
        attempting to saturate his cells rather than his senses. He exhaled an
        aromatic cloud. A semi-cough fractured the next syllables: “Carlos.
        Carlos Colón: that’s his name. A direct descendant of Christopher
        Columbus, he insists. It’s important to him. He’d say,
        <em>you know Nelson, Cristóbal didn’t abolish the edge of the world. He
          wanted us to look for it in the right place</em>. It was always funny, that intimacy, as if they’d been
        discussing
        things together in some <em>taberna</em> just the week before. I’d be
        tempted to laugh, shake him by the shoulders, tell him: ‘for Christ’s
        sake Carlos, you have no idea what he wanted.’ Not that I did, or would.
        It wasn’t just some ridiculous piece of nonsense, you see, not at all.
        It was serious — truly and totally serious. It still is serious. But you
        get that, right?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He broke off, as if expecting confirmation. It would have been absurd to
        nod – what did I know? Instead I looked to Mary, who said, with quiet
        firmness: “Oh yes, it’s serious.” I tacked on a fraudulent “sure.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Brewer seemed satisfied as he retreated into his memories. He signaled
        for more whiskey, a gesture that seemed to communicate
        <em>bring the bottle</em>. His eyes wandered through the cigar smoke, as
        if seeing something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Not that I’d have called him that – Carlos — not to his face, he
        wouldn’t have it. There were too many Carlos Colóns. It was unacceptable
        to him. <em>Call me 2Cs</em>, he said. I didn’t get it immediately.
        ‘What, you mean like, <em>to seas unknown</em>?’ I asked.
        <em>That’s right amigo</em>, he replied immediately,
        <em>to seize the unknown, to seize some pretty chica’s ass</em>. We were
        still filthy young fools – this was before the Depression, way back,
        late 1920s. We had nothing but spunk and some undeveloped smarts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He tilted the bottle towards Mary, who shook her head, then to me. I let
        him pour another finger of whiskey into my tumbler. He added two fingers
        to his own. He scanned his casino methodically, almost mechanically, as
        if seeing it for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was already on my way to this – cards – it was what I was good at,
        and Carlos helped me out with that. Once there’re two of you – a pair –
        lots of things become possible. You’re a team, and if people don’t
        realize that, <em>you have them</em>. He was really good at that,
        especially the bad stuff. He could walk into a crowded room and have
        everybody worked out within minutes. He gave nothing away. They came to
        call me ‘Granite Face’ eventually, but I learnt that from him. It was
        years before I came close to what he could do, see, and hide. His face
        told whatever story he wanted. He could be anybody. He was strict, too.
        We’d never kid about together in any place that we were working.
        <em>A secret team, that’s una máquina</em>, he’d say.
        <em>Two friends joking around in public? – Losers</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        “He worked with me on the cards, but it didn’t mean anything to him. If
        we were alone, sitting at the table after a game, he’d ask:
        <em>where’s the edge Nelson, is it here</em>? ‘Sure it’s here,’ I’d
        reply. <em>No, it isn’t here</em>. That’s all he’d say.
        <em>No, it isn’t here</em>. It would drive me mad. ‘So where the fuck is
        it? It’s here, right here.’ Slapping the table top, you know, maybe I’d
        riffle through a pile of banknotes, in his face, obnoxiously. ‘See. This
        is working. This is where things are happening.’
        <em>No, it isn’t here</em>, always that, just that, sadly, defiantly. No
        one could bully him. I had no idea what he was looking for.”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        “When the breakthrough came we were out of the game for a while, hiding
        out in a small town down by the coast, near the border. There was a bar
        there that we’d made our own, through sheer intensity of custom, and we
        were the only patrons that night, sitting together at a flimsy circular
        table, somewhere into our third bottle of mezcal. We were deeply drunk.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em>How long can you stare at tables and not see?</em> Carlos asked,
        suddenly. Not this again. Not now. ‘See what?’ I had already slurred,
        reflexively, the robot at work, you know. This seemed to enrage him. His
        voice was climbing to a howl:
        <em>Think, Nelson, fucking think enough to see the obvious fucking
          thing</em>. He even reached over and slapped me across the head, hard. It almost
        knocked me from my chair. I’ve no idea why I didn’t hit him back, or
        what would have happened if I had. Instead I groped down through swirls
        of booze-shattered sensation to the table top, soaking up the scratches
        and flaking varnish and stains. ‘It’s flat?’ I ventured.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was like flicking a switch. He erupted in an outburst of shouts and
        wild, theatrical gesticulations, waving his arms in the air as he cried:
        <em>At last, at fucking last, Jesus fucking Christ, at last</em> … It
        was stunning, stupefying. My first impulse was to search for some kind
        of question, for additional information, but fortunately I suppressed
        it. Instead I began to think, and it was then that I realized that I
        hadn’t even been trying before. To think, I mean. It hadn’t even
        occurred to me to think, <em>at all</em>. That was already to cross a
        line, seeing that stupid unreflective obstinacy, which I had been. I
        still remember the moment – the <em>instant</em> – vividly, perfectly,
        but who knows? It seems exact: the threads of smoke, the smells of sweat
        and mezcal, the quality of the light, and then the tension of that
        alien, inner machine, unexpectedly starting up. I don’t ever want to
        forget it. I might have waited for ever to start thinking – that had
        always been his point, his maddening stubbornness. Now, something had
        switched over. It came to me then, suddenly, out of nowhere, the
        critical step. Flatness. It had to be some crazy shit about Christopher
        Columbus. I was drunk, and irritated, and my left ear was ringing from
        the slap, and I two-thirds wanted to just finish with this bizarre
        conversation. But the other third had set out somewhere, and it wasn’t
        going to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        “’These aren’t your edges, are they?’ I said, running my hands along the
        sides of the table. I was quite confident about it. It wasn’t really a
        question. He just smiled – beamed, actually. <em>Go on amigo</em>, was
        all that he said. But now I wasn’t sure that I could. My thoughts
        struggled to advance. It was a swamp, or a jungle. If you came to the
        end, to what had been believed to be the end, demonstrating that it
        wasn’t an end at all, what then? Where would you look for an edge, if
        the old edges were lost, and an edge was all that mattered? The silence
        stretched out. Thought lost its purchase. I was worried that his
        patience would break. I needn’t have been.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em>It’s OK</em>, he said.
        <em>It’s hard. The next part is hard. It defeated me every time, every
          single time, for five years, but then I got it, the next step</em>
        … ‘So, what is it?’ I had never wanted to know anything this much.
        <em>You want the key?</em> he teased. ‘Sure. Yes. Absolutely I want the
        key.’
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a kind of sublime torture, utter tantalization. Time curved
        inwards, compressive, crushing, folding my life towards the answer that
        he had, and I didn’t. He knew, and it amused him. He said nothing. He
        drank and grinned, his eyes roving delightedly across my torment. Those
        minutes – were they minutes? – dragged themselves out, endlessly. A tic
        in the corner of his mouth marked out the hidden metabolism of eternity
        in tiny spasms, hoarding some unreadable, invaluable clue. I wanted to
        strangle him, rip his eyes out. The density was unbearable. It was the
        center of the world, ultimate pressure. The need to know would kill me,
        if I let it. It couldn’t go on. That was the test. I had to change, to
        stop caring, to <em>transcend, immediately</em>, accept my ignorance, or
        die… At least, that’s how it felt …”
      </p>
      <p>
        Brewer laughed, almost goofily, as if the entire story – broken off and
        already partially forgotten – had been nothing but an elaborate fishing
        yarn, a string of mock confessions fabricated to idly pass the time. He
        knocked back his whiskey, poured another, and then drew deeply on his
        cigar, exhaling luxuriantly. The depressurization was transparently
        faked. He wanted us to share, viscerally, in the unbearable anticipation
        of that moment. As he leant backwards, arching his back, stretching,
        Mary tensed forwards reciprocally, transfixed, her elbows sliding across
        the table. Perhaps she was going to succumb, and demand, hungrily, that
        he continue. The manipulation was so crude it disgusted me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I yawned rudely, finished my drink, and stubbed out the remains of my
        cigar.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s getting late Mister Brewer. I should probably be going. Thanks. It
        was fun.” I began to get up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mary half-twisted towards me, her eyes glinting with shock and rage.
        She’d been hooked, and I was ruining everything.
        <em>You stupid bitch</em>, I thought cruelly, more determined than ever
        to wreck the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        I confidently hunted Brewer’s face for the quick burst of hatred I hoped
        to find there, but there was no sign of it. Instead, there was a kind of
        weary satisfaction, at once humorous and sad. There had been no
        surprises.
      </p>
      <p>“Of course Mister Duzsl…”</p>
      <p>
        “Call me Nemo,” I interrupted sarcastically, in a petty display of
        resistance. “There’s no need for formality among old friends.”
      </p>
      <p>“Nemo then,” he continued, unruffled. “Do you have your key?”</p>
      <p>
        Without thinking, I reached into my pocket, withdrawing a plastic card,
        and then inspecting it. Interlocking double Ds narrowed it down to the
        casino hotel, but there was no number.
      </p>
      <p>“Two-zero-nine,” Brewer informed me, helpfully. “Sleep well.”</p>
      <p>
        “Sleep, holy shit,” Mary muttered irritably. “<em>As if</em> he’s going
        to sleep.”
      </p>
      <p>“Rest, then,” Brewer allowed.</p>
      <p>
        “Oh please,” Mary sighed dramatically, her frustration boiling over.
        “You know exactly what will happen to him. He’ll spiral down into the
        drug, coming apart into rags of shredded fate, until there’s nothing
        left but splintered panic and screaming.” She was looking at me, coldly
        now, even as she spoke, with the detached observation one might
        appropriately apply to a doomed lab animal. “He’s truly fucked. This was
        stupid.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mary, your imaginative extravagance betrays you,” Brewer growled,
        obviously entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mister Duzsl – Nemo – wants to rest. There’s no need for additional
        stimulation.”
      </p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Did they understand? I was unsure. Understanding had become almost
        unbelievably precious, and precarious. There were too many new facts,
        and the latest one was especially disconcerting, because the story
        Brewer had been relating was known to me now, in its entirety, from
        before its beginning to some indefinite end, or edge, far beyond its
        premature termination, and in much greater detail than had yet been
        revealed. It is not that I had somehow learnt it. Rather,
        <em>I had become somebody who already knew it</em>. That made me a
        replacement, for somebody who hadn’t known it, and who now knew nothing,
        was nothing. That supplanted creature was nothing now, but it was also –
        and equally – an earlier draft of this inexplicable being that
        considered itself to be me, and it was perhaps no less adequate compared
        to whatever had become me than I would be compared to what might soon
        follow. It would be important to keep notes.

        <h4 class="post-title">Halloween XS 2</h4>
      </a>
      <div class="entry">
        <p><strong>A (short) exercise in bombastic Halloween fiction</strong></p>
        <p>
          The dead center of the story would come at
          the end. It was a culmination, to be coaxed back – or was it forward? To
          stare into dazzling unseeing – that was the thing. Animated obscurity
          approaching him across a darkened pumpkin field.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been a dream, exquisite in its horror. Upon its return, a few
          nights later, the edges of its moonless luminosity were still undulled.
          Then, only inane slumber, for over a week. He had still written nothing
          down. By the time of the third apparition it had decayed, shredded into
          black rags by delirium, wormed-through by neglect. He awoke in a sweaty
          chaos of tangled sheets and recalcitrant memory. In a panic, he now
          sought – too late – to capture it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detail had eroded down towards a fever-ground core of inarticulate
          urgency. Numbly, he understood that the sole meaning of his career – and
          thus his life – was buried in the ruins of an unmined nightmare,
          avalanched under by confusion and thickening dread. Everything he would
          ever want to say had been whispered to him, but he had fumbled the
          priceless gift into oblivion. A jagged chunk of non-being had been flung
          at him across the desert of limbic night. With each loop of
          recollection, it receded further behind a wake of undecipherable
          reference codes. The weird tale he had been offered was reduced to an
          unthreading ghost story, degenerating by the hour, into chattering
          nonsense picked up among rumors of forbidden secrets. The sacred touch
          of vacuous insanity was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody would ever have mistaken his life for anything other than a
          futile, slow-motion catastrophe. His literary career was a partial-birth
          abortion of singular grisliness. The pieces that emerged still twitching
          soon expired amid detestable groans. Now everything fell completely
          apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seen coldly, in the morbid pre-dawn glow, it was suddenly obvious that
          the empty whisky bottles and overflowing ashtrays were detritus from a
          forgotten ritual. There had been an incompetent summoning. If repeated
          mechanically, it would deteriorate a little further. The alternative was
          to do it right. As a memento, he attached a post-it note to the computer
          screen, bearing the single word: <em>Invoke</em>. Then he stumbled
          groggily to bed. His dreams were discreet and interred in sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan had nothing to offer him, except indirectly, and unconvincingly.
          Luciferic inspiration would not ignite. Instead, the Dark Prince,
          slumped in reptilian lassitude upon the throne of doom and undisguisedly
          bored by the conversation from its first moment, merely derided his
          attachment to conventional ideas. A claw-toed foot sifted vaguely
          through the heap of crumbling skulls. “Have you drawn your entire
          contact list from a Dennis Wheatley novel?” susurrated the Old Deceiver
          with languorous contempt. There was nothing further to be said.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a circuit, locking him out. To access the name he needed to know
          who to call. Incense-clouded blackness and strange drugs broke upon a
          sea-wall of silence. At the dead-end of each ruined night, the only
          thing that mattered was further gone, recessed more deeply into the
          cross-hatched palimpsest of memory. The unintercepted missile of
          oblivion streaked away from his life, on some unimaginable course.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You need help,” said the young man in the street, proffering a
          crudely-printed pamphlet.<br />
          “Jesus Christ your Savior,” he read, enunciating slowly and carefully.
          “Nope.”<br />
          The street evangelist studied him for a drawn-out minute, in calm
          silence. “What are you searching for?” he asked eventually.<br />
          “Can’t you see?” he laughed, sleepless mental dilapidation knapping an
          edge of hysteria onto his tone. “I’m pursuing the dream.”<br />
          “You’d turn your back on peace?” the young man asked sadly.<br />
          “If I could still find the back I’d fall into it …”
        </p>
        <p>
          His abandonment of all hope led him on long, looping walks through the
          countryside. Mindless sensation blurred the damnation of unknown names.
          Autumn had enveloped him in mists and mildewed fruitlessness. He
          shuffled without objective through rotting leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything had been broken by the time he stumbled upon the distant
          perimeter. The day, the year, and his existence were simultaneously
          tumbling to an end. Light had thinned to a play of shadows. Glancing
          sideways, he was jolted from his reveries – hurled into startled
          recognition. This was the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its familiarity captured him, guiding the direction of attention.
          Realization was instantaneous, and all-engulfing. As the gates opened,
          recollection flooded back, indistinguishable from perception. Suddenly –
          diagonally – it was time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scene returned, enthralling. Every detail was assembling itself to
          perfection. He stepped forward, slowly, but without hesitation, into
          what he had once thought – once dreamt to be – no more than a nightmare.
          There was a piece cut out of his mind, matching a hole in space. Like a
          missing tooth, it was now simply <em>not there</em>. He groped for it,
          which meant taking another step forward. Whatever it wasn’t to be would
          arrive soon. That was the only certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          With solemn inevitability, the shape – like a shard of broken fate, or a
          compact rift wounding the sky – drifted toward him across the pumpkin
          field.

        <em>If you believe in yourself, you’ll believe in anything</em>. –

      <p>Based – very roughly – on a true story.</p>

        [Subsequent content carries a vulgarity and decadence warning, for
        sensitive readers.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>§00</strong>. Friday was fright
        night at my (virtual) place, and <em>Deadlines</em> was the most
        reliable source of inspiration. Most of the deracinated Shanghai morbid
        literature scene cycled through the place, but no one would be turning
        up for hours. So it was just Cal and me. We both had better things to be
        doing, which – as usual – we weren’t.<br />
        “‘Beginning is the most difficult thing.’”<br />
        “That’s it?” I asked, unconvinced.<br />
        “Yes, those words, exactly.”<br />
        “Double embedded?”<br />
        He tilted himself even further backwards into the deep leather chair, so
        that he was staring straight upwards into the attic rafters. His slow
        exhalation released a column of cigar smoke on an obscure expedition
        among the old beams. “Surely, yes … That’s all it takes.” Voice
        down-paced in dreamlike detachment. “Then it’s happening.”<br />
        If Calvin Lambsblood Dodd had written so much as a paragraph of horror
        fiction himself, it had been done in strict secrecy, without a hint of
        the fact escaping. Yet the attitude he now slipped into, once again –
        that of an authority on the topic of anomalous prose construction – had
        been adopted as if by instinct, and with seamless confidence. He was
        adept at it, undeniably.<br />
        It was hard not to smile, but my irritability was slow to dissipate.
        “‘Thing’ is wrong.” I closed my laptop, with calm theatricality, and
        finished my drink. “A beginning isn’t a ‘thing’. I use ‘thing’ too much
        already.”<br />
        Dodd squinted at me, his features micro-adjusted to some space between
        amusement and annoyance. “So you’re just going to bunker-down in your
        precious writer’s block?” He shrugged. “That’s OK. Let’s investigate the
        Thing, while we’re waiting for the others.” Then, indicating my glass
        with a slight re-angling of his head: “Ready for the next one?”<br />
        I glanced at my watch, knowing it would be precisely 3:33pm, and it was.
        Not that it mattered. “Sure.”<br />
        He caught the bartender’s attention with an absurdly feudalistic
        hand-gesture that concluded silently in two raised fingers.<br />
        “Dark Enlightenments again?” The softly-spoken words, ritualistically
        unnecessary, carried easily across the empty lounge. We both nodded in
        confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>§01</strong>. A Dark Enlightenment – or ‘333’ – is a hell of a
        drink. Dodd had spent most of a weekend inventing it, immediately after
        the Include-Me-Out Club had first been convened at <em>Deadlines</em>.
        The base was some kind of rough ‘whiskey’ he had discovered in southern
        Yunnan, distilled as moonshine in the mountains. Each bottle served as
        the pickling jar for a giant venomous centipede, which tainted the
        liquor distinctively. The complete cocktail recipe, as far as I was able
        to tell, was:<br />
        <em>2 shots ‘pede spirit<br />
          1 shot absinthe (for the wormwood)<br />
          1 shot black rum (for the extinction of light)<br />
          3 drops funestia<br />
          1 drop specially-concocted house ‘herbal tincture’<br />
          1 speck strychnine<br />
          Chili garnish<br />
          Absolutely no ice.</em><br />
        The psycho-active effects were remarkable. It was almost certainly
        illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>§02</strong>. Not that illegality was any problem for Dodd. Even
        if the Shanghai authorities had given a damn about self-inflicted brain
        damage in a private club, which they quite evidently didn’t, there was
        Dodd’s girlfriend, the ‘PP’, to manage things. PP was the ‘Party
        Princess’ (with ‘party’ referring to the Communist Party of China,
        rather than to anything more frivolous). People called her that to her
        face, and she didn’t seem to mind. Her real name was Jiang Yu, her uncle
        a senior cadre in the local party apparatus. Dodd met with him
        regularly, and they got along well. Boss Jiang’s security-related
        administrative position meshed well with Dodd’s specialism in organized
        decadence and unscrupulous trans-national deal-making. Their Party
        Nights were notorious.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>§03</strong>. Cal was strictly a facilitator, and not a
        practitioner. It was a distinction he invested with peculiar
        significance.<br />
        “I don’t need to write. I don’t want to write. Fuck writing.”<br />
        “OK.” I had no idea where he was going. “So what about this?” I gestured
        vaguely towards the surrounding lounge, abstractly indicating the club.
        This was ‘the second drink’ exchange. We must have had it hundreds of
        times before, and each time it got worse.<br />
        He squinted at me suspiciously. “Honestly?”<br />
        “Of course.”<br />
        “‘Of course’,” he repeated, the sarcasm wound up to a peculiar, biting
        extremity. Recognizing that its object was unintelligible, he added,
        awkwardly: “Which ‘course’ would that be, exactly?”<br />
        Not only was the conversation increasingly hard to follow, his mood was
        deteriorating unpredictably. There seemed no way to extract myself from
        it. I took momentary refuge in a gulp of 333. “You build a temple to
        writing, and then tell me you’re not interested?”<br />
        “Oh, that …” he feigned nonchalance, took a drink, idly toyed with a
        cigar, put it down without lighting it. Then, as if restarting randomly:
        “I never told you about Mary Karno, did I?” It wasn’t a question, and he
        didn’t bother waiting for a response. Without significant pause he
        continued: “I never told anybody about her, about her ‘practice’. It’s
        time I did.”<br />
        Up to that point I had read only a couple of Karno stories. It had been
        enough to get the gist. Her fiction was undeniably intense.<br />
        Merely by broaching the topic, Dodd had undergone an extraordinary
        transformation. His obnoxious, sullen slump of posture and affect
        switched into ardent engagement. He leant forward, as if about to
        clamber onto the table, left leg jittering as an emotional
        dissipator.<br />
        “It’s not that I don’t have problems with her stuff,” he declared,
        adamantly. Tiny drops of sweat beaded his forehead. “I mean … fuuuuuck.”
        He reclined a little. “Truly. Fuck.”<br />
        “Sure. It’s strange stuff.”<br />
        “The priest-torturing thing she has going on, it’s unbalanced. You know,
        really unbalanced.”<br />
        “Right.”<br />
        “The sex is out there too … out somewhere. Guess there has to be a
        market for that kind of metaphysically-smashed lesbo-tentacular fucking
        demon-twisted <em>goneness</em>.”<br />
        “Apparently.”<br />
        His voice dropped to something scarcely above a whisper. “Still, she’s
        serious.” He picked up his cigar, inspected it curiously, and finally
        ignited it. “Utterly serious.”<br />
        It seemed pointless to interrupt.<br />
        “She stayed in my place for a while, you know. A small place I own here.
        Off Fuxing Lu. It was an interim arrangement – lasted maybe three
        months, a little under. Thing is, the place was set up for …” He trailed
        off. Clearly, the function of this building was not easily
        describable.<br />
        I had already guessed why. “Boss Jiang?”<br />
        Dodd’s expression froze immediately into a mask of fortified suspicion,
        cross-laced with lethal traps. “What do you know?” he hissed.<br />
        “A lot more now,” I responded, with a pathetic laugh.<br />
        There was a drawn-out moment of tension. Then he smiled crookedly. “Yes,
        it was an arrangement we had,” he conceded unnecessarily. “He called it
        ‘the information room’ – set up guests there, place was rigged with all
        kinds of crazy snoop-tech shit that he provided.”<br />
        “And you put Karno in there?” I asked, in disbelief.<br />
        “It was a mistake. She was supposed to get the apartment next door – the
        unmonitored twin. It was over a week before I learnt what had happened,
        and by then the situation had become rather … sensitive.”<br />
        “Christ!”<br />
        “Yeah, well, not exactly, as you know, but the point is – I wound up
        learning a lot.”<br />
        “I bet.”<br />
        “Are you just going to carry on snarking about this? Or are you going to
        let me tell you the story?”<br />
        “No, yes, whatever. I’m interested. Obviously.”<br />
        “So you’ll shut the fuck up with the smart-ass remarks?”<br />
        “Absolutely.”<br />
        After a micro-punishment pause, he continued. “I’m going to cut short
        the technical details, because you’re being such a jerk about it. Main
        point is, Boss J. didn’t have any professional interest in Karno,
        naturally, but she kind of captures attention, if you know what I mean.
        Extracting all the video wasn’t easy, but in the end it isn’t the sort
        of material you want to leave lying around for a Party inspection team
        to stumble upon. After XJ took over, the negotiations became a lot
        smoother. A couple of bottles of Moutai and he was ready to wash his
        hands of it. Assured me there weren’t any copies. Who knows? It probably
        doesn’t even matter. I was going to delete the lot immediately – nearly
        nine gigabytes …” he scrutinized me for overt indications of skepticism.
        My poker-face held. “… but then I thought, ‘what has he seen?’ – it
        seemed important, right? I had to know what I was dealing with. You
        don’t survive in this business by blinding yourself to potentially vital
        information. Could have been some Tantric craziness with the Dalai Lama
        there, for all I knew. Sure, it felt grubby, but my hands were tied.”<br />
        ‘Grubby’ doesn’t begin to cover it, of course. It was the abomination of
        desolation. Still, Dodd had his business, and his bar. I had my blog.
        The story had to come out.<br />
        “You’re not going to mention any of this, are you?” he suddenly asked
        me, anxiously.<br />
        “I was thinking of switching a few names about.”<br />
        “Oh, hilarious.”<br />
        “You ready for another?” changing the subject.<br />
        Without replying, or taking his eyes off me, he did the neo-feudal hand
        signal again.<br />
        “It’s fate, right?” I suggested encouragingly. It seemed to work. There
        was an unknotting of tension.<br />
        “You ever see her odd little essay about ‘Ascryptions’?”<br />
        I shook my head.<br />
        “Never met anyone who gets it. You know, even remotely what it’s about.
        I certainly never did, before. Subtitled
        <em>Practices for writing on reality</em>, then wall-to-wall
        senselessness, even by her standards. Remember Bob Clayton?”<br />
        Another head shake. I didn’t want to risk interrupting him.<br />
        “Strange guy. Driven. Working on that tale about buried-alive dreams for
        over a year, without ever managing to finish it. Anyway, he was obsessed
        with that piece. Constantly trying to talk to me about it. Told me once
        that it ‘solved everything’. Hung himself from a rafter two weeks later.
        Not to imply there was any connection. I’ve come across that a lot – not
        quite so far gone, of course.”<br />
        The digressions were straining my patience, but the drinks arrived. I
        stole one of his cigars, without asking, and flamed it up.<br />
        “It’s all in the first two sentences. ‘Writers get stuck when they
        forget that every story has a demon. To begin, you have to learn its
        name.’”<br />
        “Ascryption?”<br />
        “Exactly. And there it was, on the video. I actually watched her start a
        new story – two actually – open an immaculate notebook, with a giant
        question mark, jot down a few scrappy thoughts, cross-legged, meditating
        or some shit, then cross some kind of threshold – you could see it, as
        if something had cut through her body, switched her – and then she
        <em>seriously</em> set to work, patiently, full of – what the fuck do
        you call it? – <em>intention</em>, rolling back the rug, chalking a huge
        diagram on the floor, all swirls and numbers and ancient evocations,
        then building what I can only describe as a voodoo shrine, pasted
        together out of candles, clippings from poetry books, kitchenware,
        pictures, drug paraphernalia, bits of dead animals, and electronic
        trash. She’d get up, wander around the number maze in loops, muttering
        some cryptic stuff, in a whisper – the audio was too crap to pick it up
        – then back to the shrine, shifting pieces about, nudging it towards
        convergence. It was mad as fuck, obviously, but the horrible thing was
        that I began to pick up on the purpose, I could see it
        <em>coming together</em>, like a wave out of hyper-space, the necessity
        of it, I just couldn’t stop watching, seeing it <em>arrive</em>. I mean,
        holy fuck. And then a jolt went through her, harsh and electric. She
        snapped <em>out</em>, crossed over to her laptop, and typed in the name.
        Ascryption. That’s how it works.”<br />
        We were both silent for a moment.<br />
        “She has to come and lead a discussion session at the club,” I said,
        predictably.<br />
        “Invite’s already in the motherfucking mail,” Dodd replied.

        <h4 class="post-title">Deadlines (Part-2)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Screaming is rare. Outside the movies, war zones, or psychiatric
        institutions, it’s unusual to hear anything more than an exaggerated
        squeak. This wasn’t that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alison Luria was screaming. She stood in the middle of the cluttered
        office, rigidly upright, arms by her sides, head angled slightly back.
        Her mouth was locked open, eyes tightly shut. The sound she was
        emitting, in a continuous, only slightly uneven stream, overwhelmed
        apprehension. It was less a specifiable noise than an abstract
        inaudibility, the unheard manifested as a monstrous positive entity,
        insensibility made palpable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It had begun at almost exactly the moment of entering the room. I had
        not quite finished closing the door behind me, still uncertain whom
        first to address, when – as if out of nowhere, without the slightest
        warning – a shard of sonic shrapnel sliced into my head, making any
        further thought impractical.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was my second visit to the company, and the small team was already
        vaguely familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fred something, the tech guy, was (incredibly) ignoring the phenomenon,
        and seemed still to be working. Alison’s editorial assistant, Xu Ling,
        had retreated beneath her desk, where she now lay perfectly immobile,
        coiled into a tight fetal knot. Millie Zhang, the sales director, had
        missed it. Her tidy, south-facing work-space was unoccupied. It had been
        set up as an oasis of light and order, semi-withdrawn from the gloomy
        debris-field of the larger open-plan attic area. She was probably out on
        a sales call.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had never fallen prey to mystical inclinations, and problems of an
        esoteric nature seldom detained me. If, on rare occasions, hints of
        hidden profundities over-spilled the dikes of dismissal, they elicited
        vague repulsion, rather than enthusiasm. I would, at that time, have
        reacted with instinctive aversion to any claim that the suspension of
        reason opens secret gates. (No one had ever bothered me with such
        suggestions.) Yet as the threads of intelligence were severed by the
        scream, it was as if access were being granted to the inner substance of
        the world, violently unwrapped from the distractions of visual
        identification. Something was poking through the wall of sonic oblivion
        – a clicking or crackling. <em>This isn’t a message</em>, said the
        click-code, <em>it’s just the sound of your auditory nerves dying</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would it ever stop? Had it, in reality, ever begun? Its duration had
        become a matter of no significance, because this breakage of the world
        was no longer Alison Luria screaming, but the scream as it existed in
        eternity, freed from the bonds of fact. It was the primordial scream,
        vast beyond cosmology, anonymous and inexpressive, the pure howl of
        being now perceived as it always had been …
      </p>
      <p>… and then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ceased.</p>
      <p>
        Something crawled out of her mouth, then a
        second, and a third – wasps. They wandered across her lips indecisively,
        before flickering out in a trick of minutely-dappled light. I couldn’t
        recall ever seeing a wasp in Shanghai before. Almost certainly, I still
        haven’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m finished,” she said. Then she walked past me, out of the room,
        without looking at anyone, and clattered down the stairs, fast.
      </p>
      <p>“That was intense,” I muttered awkwardly.</p>
      <p>
        Fred looked up, smiling crookedly. “Girls,” he mumbled, as if that
        explained everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a commotion behind me, and Bob Jarvis – the company’s
        Australian boss – rushed in, smiling implausibly, grabbing me by the
        shoulder to avoid pitching me across the room. “Nick! I’m so glad you
        could make it in. Are you ready to go?”
      </p>
      <p>“To go?”</p>
      <p>“To get going, to start, there’s no point messing around.”</p>
      <p>“Start work?” I asked stupidly.</p>
      <p>
        “Absolutely. Why not right now? You’re here after all. Don’t waste the
        journey. There’s no room for dithering in this business. You can have
        Alison’s desk.”
      </p>
      <p>“Yes, Alison …”</p>
      <p>
        “Nothing to worry about. Spot of tension.” He steered me across the
        room, then started picking randomly through the chaos of papers,
        battered copies of <em>Shanghai Live</em> magazine, and work-desk lunch
        detritus that surrounded her computer. Mine now, I suspected
        ambivalently. “We thought you could take over the Shang-Hive blog, keep
        it pressing forward, raise the profile, you know. Dig deeper.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ominous fragments of writing, scrawled in red ball-point, flickered from
        the print out sheets that Jarvis was consigning to the waste-paper
        basket. <em>There is no blood in Cyberspace</em>.
        <em>Endless darkness now</em>. <em>It drains</em>.
        <em>We brought it to unlife</em>. <em>And so it ends</em>.
      </p>
      <p>“Was Alison OK?” I persisted, stubbornly.</p>
      <p>
        “Oh, nothing really to worry about, it was just, you know … She was fine
        wasn’t she Sue?” he pretended to ask, reaching out for narrative
        support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Xu Ling looked as if she were about to vomit. She nodded in grim
        obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fred, what <em>was</em> that business with Alison about?” Jarvis
        soldiered on. “Any previous signs of a problem?”
      </p>
      <p>“Was it in any way work-related?” I interrupted.</p>
      <p>
        Fred was struggling to suppress a cruel smirk. “Perhaps a little,” he
        said. “Towards the end, her blogging became a little … I don’t know, I
        guess you could say, weird.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “No one said anything to me about that,” Jarvis cut in, clearly
        irritated by the direction this conversation was taking.
      </p>
      <p>“‘Weird’?” I refused to let that go.</p>
      <p>
        “Yeah, you could definitely say that, I suppose,” Fred explained. “She
        said that she’d ‘contacted something’.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Contacted something <em>in the backend</em>,” Xu Ling added. She looked
        like under-cooked death.
      </p>
      <p>Fred scowled at her. “Like she even knew what the backend is.”</p>
      <p>“What is the backend?” I was clutching.</p>
      <p>
        Jarvis waved away the query. “You don’t need to worry about that. Nor
        did Alison. That’s what we have a tech team for, isn’t it Fred?”
      </p>
      <p>“The backend is where everything happens,” Fred said. “You’ll see.”</p>

      <p>
        There’s a horror story I’m writing (slowly), developing from the central
        conceit that the ‘monster’ (Vauung) is the war. It feeds upon
        escalation, zig-zagging between antagonists, to extinguish any
        inclinations towards peace. It’s part <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, part
        <em>Blood Meridian</em> (“War is God”), part other stuff … It’s not
        going to be finished for a while.

        truly excellent, which isn’t fiction (exactly), but clearly tunes into
        Vauung-signal:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Toxoplasma is a neat little parasite that is implicated in a couple
          of human diseases including schizophrenia. Its life cycle goes like
          this: it starts in a cat. The cat poops it out. The poop and the
          toxoplasma get in the water supply, where they are consumed by some
          other animal, often a rat. The toxoplasma morphs into a rat-compatible
          form and starts reproducing. Once it has strength in numbers, it
          hijacks the rat’s brain, convincing the rat to hang out conspicuously
          in areas where cats can eat it. After a cat eats the rat, the
          toxoplasma morphs back into its cat compatible form and reproduces
          some more. Finally, it gets pooped back out by the cat, completing the
          cycle.</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          What would it mean for a meme to have a
          life cycle as complicated as toxoplasma?
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the war on terror. It’s a truism that each time the United
          States bombs Pakistan or Afghanistan or somewhere, all we’re doing is
          radicalising the young people there and making more terrorists. Those
          terrorists then go on to kill Americans, which makes Americans get
          very angry and call for more bombing of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taken as a meme, it is a single parasite with two hosts and two forms.
          In an Afghan host, it appears in a form called “jihad”, and hijacks
          its host into killing himself in order to spread it to its second,
          American host. In the American host it morphs in a form called “the
          war on terror”, and it hijacks the Americans into giving their own
          lives (and several bajillion of their tax dollars) to spread it back
          to its Afghan host in the form of bombs.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the human point of view, jihad and the War on Terror are opposing
          forces. From the memetic point of view, they’re as complementary as
          caterpillars and butterflies. Instead of judging, we just note that
          somehow we accidentally created a replicator, and replicators are
          going to replicate until something makes them stop.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p><em>Replicators are also going to evolve.</em> …</p>
      <p>
        I’m assuming that “Instead of judging …” isn’t a deliberate
        <em>Apocalypse Now</em> (or Judge Holden) reference, but it works as
        one.

        soft suggestive tap to the base of the brain.)

        <h4 class="post-title">Bloody Mary</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        §00 — It required only a mirror. Initially, at least, it seemed like
        that, although it turned out there was more.<br />She had been known as
        ‘Hell Mary’ at times. There were many other names.
      </p>
      <p>
        §01 — The ritual varied, but was never complicated. Its simplicity was
        essential. In that lay the danger, supposedly. The invocation could be
        realized almost by accident. It might begin as nothing more than a joke,
        or a dare. A disastrous non-seriousness is the core of the urban legend.
        The proximal agents, scarcely older than children, typically, are
        playing about with something they don’t understand. The Hell Prank is
        archetypal. Deadly foolishness, or worse, is not difficult to imagine,
        if only in broad outline. Teenage kids do it best. They’re trying to
        prove something, and then do, by mistake. Movie viewers like to watch
        them damn themselves. With younger children it’s more horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
        §02 — Start at the exoteric level, at least in appearance. The point
        isn’t to make something happen, but rather the opposite. You are
        supposed to avoid the ritual, out of fear. It’s what
        <em>might have happened</em>, had you not been so chicken, that stokes
        the thrill. The dark potential preserves itself this way. It intimidates
        against disproof. This is where the legend and the real story part ways.
        They remain, nevertheless, confusingly entangled. Ironic twists thicken
        the obscurity. The legend itself has a real story. Actuality belongs
        only to the legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        §03 — Divergence goes further than this. The legend is a central part of
        the real story. It’s the legend, alone, that protects Bloody Mary from
        examination. The ritual is structured as a challenge. An examination
        that is declined leaves its object, in principle, examinable. This is
        the ontological payload.
        <em>Do you want to see what’s in this box?</em> It could be something
        too horrific to bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        §04 — Although the story is archetypal, there’s always a first time.
        Vanessa Sheridan had never heard it before. She’d never heard
        <em>anything at all like it</em> before. It thrilled and appalled her in
        equal measure. The idea split time in two. To go back was impossible.
        Innocence was Bloody Mary still unthought. Experience opened a new
        universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        §05 — How had Christine known? This knowledge had desynchronized them.
        Even as the moment before sharing receded, it still separated them. They
        would always now, then, have been strangers. For such asymmetry ever to
        have been was enough. It could not be unmade all the way to non-being.
        Some echo of the gulf would always persist. What had once been
        friendship could never be anything so simple again. Perhaps it would be
        more. Their dark complicity was a bond. Bloody Mary connected them, even
        as she prized them apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        §06 — Chris had called her <em>Nessie</em> at first, like the monster
        from the loch. She’d found it mildly annoying, but three syllables were
        too much to ask, and there was nothing else. So <em>Vee</em> had come as
        a relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        §07 — Her tenth year would soon begin. Things would then start over,
        automatically. It was as if there had been time enough for anything to
        be learnt. That she still knew so little could only be an accident. She
        understood what such an accident meant now – by contrast – because she
        knew this.
      </p>
      <p>
        §08 — They would do it, she was sure. The looming horizon was no less
        critical than death. At the end, Bloody Mary would step out of the
        mirror. Nothing more could ever happen. It would be finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        §09 — Dusk was draining away into night. At one level – and perhaps
        several – she expected nothing to occur. There was no Santa Claus,
        Tooth-Fairy, or Easter Bunny. There was also, she was beginning strongly
        to suspect, No God. That was certainly her elder brother’s vociferously
        confident assertion. No God was, for him, a positive cosmic principle,
        equaling zero. It was not a deficiency, but an operator. For there to be
        no Bloody Mary, then, was by far the tidiest conclusion. Yet she was
        also sure it could not be so simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        §10 — <em>Ontology</em> was not a word she yet commanded, and its
        absence gaped unrecognized within her. The spell she sought to cast upon
        her thoughts required it. She had to reach all the way down to the being
        of things. Whatever Bloody Mary was, or was not, she did not belong in
        the world. She was a rip, gash, or rending. She was of the substance
        that might be drawn by a blade.<br />“Cut it out,” Vee murmured to
        herself, when such thoughts wouldn’t stop, in order to continue them.
      </p>
      <p>
        §11 — In the end it was not ontology, but rather sorcery, that was
        sovereign here. <em>What could be called up?</em> That was the question,
        and no other.<br />“It’s called <em>invocation</em>,” Chris had solemnly
        explained. “<em>I invoke thee fell spirit</em>.”<br />“Those are the
        words?”<br />“Once they were.”<br />“And now?” asked Vee.<br />“We have
        to find them.”<br />“Like a password,” Vee had said, understanding
        immediately.<br />Chris nodded. “Exactly like that.”<br />It would be
        difficult, then. But <em>difficult</em> meant possible. There was a way.
        Passwords were meant to be used. They were hidden only because finding
        them matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        §12 — It seemed too much to ask that anyone could want it as she did. To
        want it absolutely, at any cost, when nothing about it could be commonly
        conceived as desirable, was suggestive of isolation. Such longings
        dismissed every ordinary idea of sharing. She’d thought about trying it
        on her own, but had immediately known that would not do. Company was
        necessary. In solitude, whatever happened could be mere madness, of the
        emptiest kind. Its credibility would be fragile, even to her. The event
        would remain stuck in her mind. That was not the destination.<br />To
        escape, it had to undeniably exceed her.
      </p>
      <p>
        §13 — Astonishingly, there was Chris, so it would happen after all.
        Chris was committed, <em>serious</em>. She was patient, and knew how to
        concentrate. Most of all she was stubborn. <em>Dogged</em> was how Alex
        described her. She could be trusted not to stop. That was the important
        thing. Bloody Mary was a name for something indescribably bad happening,
        but that wasn’t the way to lose the game. The only way to
        <em>lose</em> was to stop. Chris understood that, or would act as if she
        did. She would keep going, further in.
      </p>
      <p>
        §14 — They were waiting together, unhurried.<br />“What do you think?”
        Chris asked. She was talking about <em>it</em>, obviously.<br />Vee
        simmered in the question silently, her eyes closed. The excitement was
        painful, scarcely bearable. She couldn’t speak, at first, because too
        much would show.<br />“Nothing,” she said, eventually. “There’s nothing
        yet.”<br />“There’s no rush.”<br />“No rush, or anything else,” Vee
        joked. Humor cloaked solemnity. “There’s time.” There was some, at
        least.<br />It was still early. Perhaps half an hour of dusk remained.
        Bloody Mary would belong to the night. How could it be otherwise? Her
        complexion bled into ultimate shadow. Her gaze was abolition.
      </p>
      <p>
        §15 — A sleep-over at Chris’ would be the occasion, if not this time,
        then another. There was no doubt about the room. It could have been made
        for Bloody Mary.<br />A huge old mirror dominated one wall. It was hard
        to understand how it could have been moved into the attic. It was as if
        the space had been built around it.<br />“Like a ship in a bottle,”
        Chris had said, sharing the same thought. The analogy was odd, and
        stimulating. Something that – upon reflection –
        <em>didn’t seem to fit</em> was the common element. It was inherently
        sorcerous in some way. At first it had to look like a trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        §16 — Chris’ mom had required some persuasion. She suspected they were
        up to something troubling. Not that she would have come close to
        guessing what. There was a surreptitious undercurrent they were unable
        to fully conceal.<br />“Are you girls up to something?” she’d once
        asked. The obscurity of their secret permitted no question more exact.
        They’d been ‘all innocence’ in response. She had to smile. How bad could
        it be?<br />“I’m not really happy about you with candles up there,” she
        said. “Those old beams are like fire-wood.”<br />Such fears were so
        misdirected Vee struggled to control her expression.<br />Chris assuaged
        her mother’s concern without great difficulty. They would be
        <em>careful</em>, she had gently insisted. The candles were never left
        unattended. They were in tins.
      </p>
      <p>
        §17 — It could only happen once, obviously – or even subtly. An end
        could not repeat. If Bloody Mary was not the end, she was nothing. Her
        finality would be her signature. Last things would crash in, to undo the
        illusion of the world. There could be no afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        §18 — They were making their way circuitously to Chris’ place. The
        streets were unusually quiet. It threatened to rain, but didn’t.<br />“I’ve
        been thinking about blood.” It was chanted more than spoken.<br />Chris
        nodded. “Yes, me too,” she said. “<em>Bloodiness</em> is especially
        fascinating.”<br />“And multitudinous,” Vee added, using her favorite
        word. There was no need to explain why. So many types of bloodiness had
        swirled among their thoughts.<br />“<em>Bloody hell</em> is such a
        strange oath.” It was odd and English to them, but then Bloody Mary was
        too.<br />“Does she bleed? Or is it only that she
        <em>brings blood</em>?”<br />“Bloodshed,” Chris mused. “She’s
        bloodshed.”<br />“The mother of bloodshed,” Vee suggested.<br />“Our
        secret blood mother,” Chris agreed. “Bloody Mary, come to us.”<br />“Blood,”
        they said together, stressing the plosives. “Let there be blood.”
      </p>
      <p>
        §19 — Again they circled the question.<br />“What does her name really
        say?”<br />It was always the problem, carrying them forward, like a
        current. However its surface varied, in its depths it was the same.<br />Chris
        had returned from a family holiday in France months before. She had run
        to Vee immediately upon getting home, to excitedly share her linguistic
        discoveries. <em>Mary</em>, she had learnt, whispered of
        <em>mother</em>, of death, and of the sea. A <em>murmur</em> rippled it.
        As fine metal, tapped by a knife, it sang.<br />Now, when asking about
        her name, they explored for codes.<br />“There are secret echoes running
        through it,” Vee said.<br />“It has layers.”<br />The responsive nodding
        to each line would become more vigorous. “And what does she dream?”<br /><em>This</em>
        was the silent answer. <em>She dreams this</em>.<br />Through the
        thought she made contact, around the back. Soft, spine-prickling hints
        of cold lunacy crept in with the idea. They shivered in acceptance.<br />“What
        is madness, really?”<br />It was an enigma they agreed upon. Only a
        ritual could respond to it, because Bloody Mary was madness itself. She
        was the still eye of the cyclone, the absolute tranquility that lurked
        within delirium. The world’s insanity found shelter in her.
      </p>
      <p>
        §20 — There was a window in the roof, letting in natural light. It had
        not been cleaned for a while. At night, dust-smeared splinters of
        starlight poked through it. A smudged moon fell through it heavily, to
        sink into the depths of the mirror. The heavens were re-written, vague
        and converse.<br />An old wooden chest served as a shrine. Over months,
        they’d collected things for it. The candles had come first. A closing
        church sale provided most of those.<br />The center-piece was an old
        doll of abnormal apparent maturity and creepiness which Vee had found in
        a curiosity shop. Unblinking gray eyes stared accusingly from her broken
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        §21 — Gripped by sinister excitement, she had taken Chris to the shop
        the next day. For weeks it was their hunting ground. It supplied the
        shrine with other things. They added a small collection of Victorian
        post cards, showing incongruously smiling visitors to ominous places.
        Then there came an ornamental knife, pieces from an old sewing kit, and
        some obscure surgical instruments. A long-stopped clock, fixed upon some
        forgotten midnight, dominated the edge of the composition. Every item
        had been painstakingly agreed upon. They’d taken their time, but never
        really disagreed. Those things which were <em>right</em> only needed to
        be recognized. There were enough of them by now. The pattern, while
        ungraspable, was complete. It released a mute call.
      </p>
      <p>
        §22 — Their most important find was a second mirror. Placed across from
        the shrine, beneath the window, it exploded visual space into infinity.
        Within this endless room, it was as if anything that might possibly be
        seen now could be. The invitation was near-palpable. It silently
        appealed for occupancy. To be visually absorbed into it would be
        scarcely less soul-shattering than Bloody Mary herself. Almost, Vee
        felt, she could hear the utterly hushed whisperings of the boundless
        mirror-labyrinth. They spoke so softly they could only be remembered as
        imaginings. <em>Her</em> name had to be said, and also could not be
        said. The path was obliquely suggested, in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        §23 — Vee and Chris each lit one of the large candles. Simultaneity had
        been a ceremonial necessity, which could be left unspoken. They swapped
        subtle smiles at its perfect accomplishment, as they prolonged it. Their
        lives to this moment had been twin training disciplines. Convergence was
        completing itself.<br />They both knew it was time. After all, which it
        might nearly be, if not now, when? The question answered itself, in mute
        urgency. It had begun already.<br />In the mirror, the distended moon
        seemed to ache for abomination. Raw existence was pitched upward toward
        an unbearable limit. It throbbed at the brink of crisis. Some mad,
        absent music tormented it. They held each other for a moment, in
        psychological defense against the wild slashings of non-existent
        violins.<br />Chris was stretched by the ritual, tautened. Her eyes
        blazed with inexorable purpose.<br />Vee saw through her into darkness
        and absolute loss. The intensity hurt somewhere that felt beyond bodily
        location. She gulped back a moan.
      </p>
      <p>
        §24 — Candle flames, mirror-multiplied without limit, jittered as if
        caught by an alien draft. A subtle chill seemed less in the air than
        outside it.<br />She would be behind them in a direction that could
        never be turned towards.<br />“Bloody Mary,” they intoned together.<br />The
        end was near.
      </p>

        <h4 class="post-title">Patience</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        §00 — Stuart Thorndike had never been a ‘morning person’. This basic
        trait, however, was only poor preparation for what now befell him. He
        woke from what hazily seemed to have been torments without limit. Memory
        would have been unbearable. He clawed his way out of the clammy
        sheets.<br />
        “My throat,” he gasped.<br />
        Cecily, his wife, looked haggard and ill-tempered. The sympathy that had
        still dominated the day before was wearing thin. Evidently she had been
        over-stretched.<br />
        “You were screaming,” she said. “It’s the same as before – perhaps
        worse. You were screaming as if possessed, for most of the night. It was
        horrible, again.”<br />
        “Bad dreams,” he ventured, unimaginatively.<br />
        “At least,” she snapped. “You should see someone. I’m serious. This
        can’t go on.”
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        §01 — Over breakfast her questions were colder, and more determined. Her
        patience had broken.<br />
        “Do you remember anything this time?”<br />
        “Not really.” He paused to wrestle the mental fog, but it only
        thickened.<br />
        “Why would you place a bomb in a tree?” she asked.<br />
        The question meant nothing to him. He stared at her blankly.<br />
        “That’s what you were mumbling about, before the screaming started,” she
        continued. “‘I finished making the bomb, it’s in the tree. We only have
        to wait now.’ You said it several times.”<br />
        “Was it my voice?” he asked. He wasn’t sure where the question came
        from.<br />
        “Who else would it have belonged to?”<br />
        “Did it sound like me?”<br />
        “It wasn’t raving or screaming, if that’s what you mean.”<br />
        “And you’re sure that’s what it said?”<br />
        “Completely,” she said. “You should take a look in the garage. I did.
        It’s disturbing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        §02 — After putting the task off for over an hour, he went down to check
        the garage. Cecily’s grim judgment was hard to contradict. If someone
        had not been building a bomb there, it was almost as if they’d been
        pretending too. The scattering of nitrate chemicals, clock parts, and
        sawn-off metal tubing was hard to otherwise explain. Who could it have
        been, if not him? He tried to put a hoax narrative together, but quickly
        gave up on the attempt. The fabrication was too obvious. It could have
        been no one else. He had no memory of it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        §03 — Had not some philosopher once said that
        <em>Consciousness is Hell</em>? It would have to be a gloomy German,
        most probably, or perhaps a French existentialist. He couldn’t remember,
        if he had ever actually known. Maybe it was a Swede, or a Norwegian.
        Thorndike was not, in any case, an avid reader of such literature. In
        his opinion, it tended consistently to unfettered extravagance. Even
        now, after the gnawing horror of recent nights, the formula struck him
        as hyperbolic. Yet he could vaguely intuit a psychological situation in
        which it would not be, at all, for the first time in his life.
        Certainly, he had not awoken into any such situation. Perhaps, though,
        he had awoken dimly recalling one. This was a thought he found himself
        reluctant to more thoroughly explore.

      <p>
        §04 — Thorndike soon learnt that the ‘specialist’ Cecily had in mind for
        him was not a medical professional.<br />
        “She’s an old friend,” Cecily said. “There’s nobody I’ve ever trusted
        more.”<br />
        He could have taken that as a slight. In less disillusioned times he
        might have.<br />
        “She calls herself a <em>reader</em>,” Cecily added. “It’s a good
        description.”<br />
        “What the hell does it mean?”<br />
        “She reads things.”<br />
        “Things?” he asked.<br />
        “Situations, problems – people.”<br />
        “Me, you’re thinking?”<br />
        “Someone has to.”
      </p>
      <p>
        §05 — The ‘consultancy’ struck Thorndike as a parody of itself. Every
        visible surface had been swallowed into a seething chaos of astrological
        and cartomantic symbolism. Ancient Egyptian themes predominated.
        Hieroglyphs jostled against algebraic formulae in the extended margins
        of charts, tables, and diagrams of obscurely ominous implication. There
        were pictures, too, whose inferior number was compensated by superior
        size and still more – in most cases – by teeming inner multiplicity.
        They were, no doubt deliberately, dizzying to contemplate. Animal-headed
        gods erupted from the walls in mad multitudes. The air was glutinous
        with mind-clogging fragrances. To casual inspection, it was generic to
        the point of absurdity. If not for the recommendation, he would have
        dismissed the place contemptuously. It epitomized flamboyant
        intellectual indiscipline, of a kind he had always found peculiarly
        repellant. <em>Every belief is at once a disgrace</em>. That was the
        Thorndike family motto, never explicitly formalized, but resiliently
        preserved down through the male line. To withhold credence was a matter
        of honor. To believe was scarcely better than to beg. Staring now at
        some solemn Anubis, he recalled the tradition with a grimace.
      </p>
      <p>
        §06 — She wanted him to talk, which he found himself strangely reluctant
        to do.<br />
        “There’s much I still don’t know,” she said.<br />
        “I don’t think you know anything,” he grumbled in reply. Perhaps the
        insolence was an attempt to abort developments in the immediate wake of
        their conception. If so, it didn’t work. At some level, he’d known that
        it wouldn’t.<br />
        “So why are you here?” she asked. Her calm was untouched by even the
        slightest hint of amusement.<br />
        “Curiosity,” he said.<br />
        “Not so.” It was stated softly, as a matter of obvious fact, rather than
        as a step in an argument.<br />
        “So, why then?” he asked, drawn in irresistibly.<br />
        “You’re here because you feel – obscurely – like a prey animal.”<br />
        The accuracy of the analysis upset him.<br />
        “What were you told?” he asked.<br />
        “What could I have been told? You haven’t shared your dreams, with
        anybody.” This, again, was true. “Not intentionally, at least,” she
        added. “Naturally, there are other <em>tellers</em>. My profession is
        based upon them.”<br />
        “<em>Naturally</em>,” he repeated. It came out sounding childish, like a
        sneer. He had attempted to avoid that. “I’m sorry. My manners are not
        usually so badly frayed.”<br />
        She waved away the apology. They were beyond such things.
      </p>
      <p>
        §07 — As she explained how things would proceed, he found something
        obscurely unsettling about her persistent mention of <em>the cards</em>.
        His personal distaste for the conventional trappings of occultism
        accounted only for part of it, but only a part. The word suggested an
        uncanny doubling. It took him a moment to close upon it. Cartomancy,
        too, was a ritual of sorts, and also an invitation. It was meant to open
        a door.<br />
        Ultraviolet photographs of flowers exhibited landing-strips for
        pollinators, as he had seen in books, and on TV. Cecily, who loved
        gardening, gathered such information assiduously, and spread it
        outwards. These images returned as he watched the reading blossom. The
        pattern was not really for him. It spoke to unseen witnesses he
        resented.
      </p>
      <p>
        §08 — Tarot came first, according to occult tradition. He, however, had
        no doubt that reality ran the other way. Playing cards had branched into
        arcane functions. The idea had inane and insidious versions. The former
        had previously held him – he had assumed securely. Now things flipped.
        The derivation of cartomantic ritual from casual pastimes began to seem
        positively insidious. There was more, though, he realized. ‘Cards’ was a
        word, which itself carried <em>charge</em>, beyond anything it said.
        There was an unnatural insistence to it. Its single syllable packed
        irreducible plurality within itself. It was a nuclear spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        §09 — He had been drifting.<br />
        “There’s a ritual,” she said. “One which, when completed, will provide
        an invitation. To perform it would be a very serious mistake. Your
        destiny now suspends from this.”<br />
        “The danger is that I deliberately let this whatever-it-is in?” he
        asked, enveloping the question in a nervous laugh. He had to be
        misunderstanding the idea, surely? “Why <em>the fuck</em> would I do
        that? It would be utterly insane.” The suggestion deeply annoyed him.<br />
        “You should be careful,” she said, with calm gravity. “The cards suggest
        great peril. You have upset something. Perhaps you know that?”<br />
        He half-did, at least. “And by ‘upset’ you mean?” he asked.<br />
        “You turned something over, stumbled into it. I have to suspect
        clumsiness.”<br />
        “When did this happen?”<br />
        “Three days ago.”<br />
        He thought back. Three days ago? What had he been doing then? It had
        been an entirely ordinary Wednesday, to superficial recollection.<br />
        “Is it possible to specify the time?”<br />
        “Late afternoon, early evening,” she said without hesitation. “Perhaps a
        little later than it is now. Not much.”<br />
        He would have been on the way to the club, then. This regular journey
        took him on a twenty-five-minute walk through some of London’s quieter
        streets. Last Wednesday’s stroll had not been especially memorable. No
        unusual encounters came to mind. Later, in the club, he’d lost himself
        in <em>The Spectator</em>, with a whisky and cigar. Nothing had
        <em>reached in</em> to meet him – as far as he had noticed.<br />
        “Nothing,” he said.<br />
        “But actually there was something,” she replied stubbornly. “There has
        to have been, <em>as you know</em>. Let’s take a closer look.”<br />
        She flipped the cards back into the pack, and shuffled it without taking
        her eyes from him. The procedure had been long automated into instinct,
        clearly.<br />
        After a few seconds of this, she placed three cards in a row, studying
        them in motionless silence.<br />
        “Patience,” she said.<br />
        He initially misunderstood the word as an admonition. His irritable
        jitters no doubt deserved it. He sought to get a better grip upon
        himself. Twitching was risible. Then he remembered the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        §10 — Outside, dusk had been deepening. There was something sickly about
        the half-light that strayed in. It hinted at hallucination, even
        madness. The club was almost empty. He’d noticed Basil Heath, sitting
        alone at the bay window table. Heath had been playing a card game.
        <em>Cyclone solitaire</em> was the name he had given to it, when asked.
        It was peculiarly involving. The cards rotated between three piles, and
        were removed in pairs.<br />
        “How’s it going?” Thorndike had asked. It was a casual question,
        scarcely expecting a reply.<br />
        Heath had looked up, his expression somehow haunted, and abnormally
        grave. “Not well,” he said. “Not well at all.” His voice trembled at the
        edge of indignity. “An unprincipled man, in such straits, might even try
        to pass it over.”<br />
        “Pass it over?” Thorndike had not understood the remark. Its intensity –
        apparently so disproportionate – was disconcerting. “I don’t know the
        game,” he’d said. “I’d be of little use to you.”<br />
        Heath made no further acknowledgement. His forehead was slick with
        perspiration. A gambler perched upon the brink of ruin could have looked
        no worse.<br />
        Thorndike had looked down then, again, at the table, drawn to the shape
        of the cards strewn upon it, and – for some fleeting fraction of a
        second – <em>seen through it</em>. The content of this vision was
        concealed behind a black wall now. It was buried from him in the way
        dreams were. He might have thought it a dream, were it not lodged so
        firmly in the day, framed by lucidity without respite.<br />
        “I saw something,” he said.<br />
        “Yes,” she agreed. “And you heard something, too.”<br />
        She was right. During the initial recollection it had come first. It had
        not been quite a bark, but that was the closest approximation to the
        sound that had a name. He shuddered at its echo.<br />
        “Horrible,” he mumbled. “It shocked me.”<br />
        It was like sheer <em>suddenness</em> made audible. The shock was part
        of its texture. No one ever <em>jumps out of their skin</em>, but at
        that moment he had understood the expression. The unanticipated had
        detonated – cracked. Everyone, surely, would react to it, he had
        thought. The entire club would be stricken. Panic would ensue. Then he
        had looked around, amazed. The calm was more terrifying than anything he
        could remember.<br />
        “Yet no one heard it, beside you,” Cleo said. “You must then have
        realized that it came from elsewhere. It’s why you forgot. It didn’t
        fit.”<br />
        It had been an after-shock, to recognize that solitude.
        <em>So this is madness</em>, he had thought. The unexpected solidity of
        it chilled him. Argument was irrelevant to it. It meant only
        <em>to be alone</em>. Not swirling delusion, but simply incontestable
        <em>private evidence</em>. There was nothing to correct.<br />
        “Private evidence tends to go astray,” she continued, as if emulating
        telepathy. “That makes it a good place to hide.”<br />
        “Good?”<br />
        “Good for it.”<br />
        “Yet you can see.”<br />
        “It knows I pose no threat to it,” she said coldly. “It smells my
        neutrality.”
      </p>
      <p>
        §11 — How difficult could it be to decline the performance of a
        summoning ritual? Nothing could be easier, surely? Yet an actual
        <em>spine-tingle</em> accompanied the question. Something like a cold
        itch had infiltrated the lumbar region, from a dimension beyond
        scratching. The sensation preceded understanding, but opened a path for
        it. <em>Things were coming the other way</em>. That was the ghostly
        precursor to the idea, registered as a visceral shadow of intuition.
        There are thoughts the body warns against. This was one of them.<br />
        Why would it require an invitation? It was a familiar idea, from vampire
        myth, perhaps also other places, he hazily remembered. In one
        black-and-white fragment of an old horror movie the predator waited
        outside a window. Its target occupied the room on the other side. They
        tricked you into letting them in. Predation by permission was a demonic
        trait, it seemed.<br />
        “What does it want?” he asked. “If it wants anything, that is.”<br />
        “It wants only to exist, and what follows from that.”<br />
        “So what does? Follow from that, I mean.”<br />
        “Roughly speaking, the trajectory it arrives on is prolonged. It
        continues on its path.”<br />
        “The way it gets in defines what it will be like?”<br />
        “It likes spirals, fire, and blood,” she said, as if still in
        conversational sequence.<br />
        “Have you got anything more definite?”<br />
        “Hard consonants –
        <em>cat-stutter, catastrophe, cataclysmic, tactical, contracts</em> –
        words like that could attract it. It hunts for fun.”<br />
        “You mean it searches for fun?”<br />
        “No, the other thing,” she said, smiling coldly. “It might amuse you, if
        that level of detachment were possible. As it is, a certain dark
        laughter could be a warning sign. If you start to identify with it,
        that’s an indication it’s getting in.”<br />
        “Perhaps you’re enjoying this too much,” he growled.<br />
        “My objectivity is what you’re paying for. If you want a shoulder to cry
        on, you could find one more cheaply.”<br />
        “I’d rather hoped that for almost two-hundred pounds an hour I wouldn’t
        have to wonder if you were on my side.”<br />
        “If I was simply <em>against</em> it, I wouldn’t be able to help you at
        all.”<br />
        He knew she was right. Pretending to argue was idiotic immaturity. He
        sighed. “So what’s next?”<br />
        “Seriousness,” she scolded. “You’re in a lot of trouble, even without
        being stupid about it.”<br />
        He might have bristled against the condescension under other
        circumstances.<br />
        “So it’s waiting for me to offer it a key?”<br />
        She nodded.<br />
        “Then, how long?” he continued. “I mean, if I’m going to try to out-wait
        it, how long will that take?”<br />
        She took a while to respond, watching him. He found her expression
        difficult to read. “It would be best to assume
        <em>longer than you have</em>,” she said, eventually. “Such beings don’t
        lose time games.”<br />
        They were done, then. She was restoring the cards to dormancy. There was
        nothing more to be learnt, or said.
      </p>
      <p>
        §12 — The consultation had taken more than two hours. By the time it had
        finished, night was thickening.<br />
        He paused for a moment outside, before setting back. Behind him, the
        warmth of the shop light quickly fell away into icy obscurities.<br />
        The road ahead was discouraging. He was out-matched, to an
        incomprehensible degree. Whatever ailed his soul outflanked it in every
        conceivable – and even inconceivable – direction. However he ran, he
        would run into it. So he told himself he would not run.<br />
        The rain had stopped. Nightlights shattered among reflections. There was
        no doubting the town’s charms. He was aware, to an unusual degree, that
        it would be sad to leave.<br />
        The moon appeared unnaturally large. For a disconcerting moment he found
        its scale indicative of dreaming. Clues of some deep delusion swirled
        into themselves, drawing abstract spirals. Would it like that?<br />
        Vision seemed to have a surface – a kind of film. He was stretching out
        a finger to touch it before noticing.
      </p>
      <p>
        §13 — It would be safer – perhaps even faster – to cut diagonally across
        the fields. The ground was dry enough for efficient progress.<br />
        Before reaching the house, there would be the woods. He would probably
        spend no more than five minutes among the trees. A few hundred seconds –
        it would not be long. Yet he balked at the prospect.
        <em>If something was waiting for him, it would be there</em>.<br />
        There was a demand being made for discipline, he soberly realized.
        Childish fears were no longer affordable. Survival called for a new way.
        It could begin from a confrontation with the dark.<br />
        It was not just ontogeny but also – and more profoundly – phylogeny that
        trembled within him. Like wind and water upon eon-exposed rocks, the
        fangs of a billion ancient predators had carved his fears. Not millions,
        but tens and hundreds of millions of years whispered their dread.
        <em>Those who feared less are no longer among us</em>, they said.
        <em>Ravenous things, stalking silently through the night, bore them away
          into a deeper darkness</em>. It was thus, and not in the proximate world, that his nightmares had
        been trained. The murmurings of archaic terror drew his attention
        astray.<br />
        He left the open ground and the black mass of the forest swallowed him.
        He paused as his eyes adjusted. Gray-scale gradually returned. Shapes
        emerged. This was the crossing. Ancient nightmares beyond number
        chattered softly on the dark periphery. Yet it was only as it ever was.
        There was no hint of novel or exceptional encroachment. If something had
        happened, he had missed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        §14 — Cecily was gone. A note – neatly-folded into a miniature tent –
        stood on the table by the door. The message was formally affectionate,
        but curt. She doubted her value to him at this time, it said. He
        shrugged.<br />
        Better that she not be involved in this. She couldn’t help, and might
        easily come to harm. There was something more – a darker component to
        his response, which he didn’t want to think about. The gist crept in,
        nevertheless. This wasn’t <em>for her</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        §15 — Standing in the hallway of the silent house, he thought, now,
        about what he’d been told. <em>Spirals</em> meant nothing much to him.
        They were easy enough to recognize. The rigorous definition, he
        supposed, was mathematical. It would likely exceed his comprehension.
        Where he struggled was on the possible application to his case. To have
        been advised of the entity’s attraction to irregular tetrahedrons would
        have drawn a comparable blank. Pursuit would not be cost-effective, he
        knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        §16 — Fire was quite probably mere <em>smoking</em>. It was the one
        indefensible thing, above all, that everyone knew
        <em>you should stop</em>. His hackles rose against the scarcely
        contestable imperative.
        <em>You’d let a monstrosity from beyond The Veil crash into your soul
          rather than abstain from burning some few pitiful shreds of tobacco
          leaf?</em>
        Yet the habit would only dig itself in deeper. Certain counter-arguments
        had begun to mindlessly arrange themselves, like the wasp pattern of an
        orchid flower. He extracted a cigarillo from their silver case and
        stepped out onto the dark veranda. His heavy old Zippo, picked up years
        past from a small-town curio shop, sat in a saucer on the window sill.
        It smelt strongly of gasoline. <em>Fire</em>, it said to him, silently,
        as it glinted in the moonlight. <em>It likes fire</em>. The temptation
        to ignite the flame was not – quite – irresistible. Once burning, the
        cigarillo would be a complex sign. It would express defiance, most
        superficially. If that, though, it would surely also spell
        <em>invitation</em>. Fear would condense upon it, as if drawn in to a
        beacon. A dimension would collapse, simplifying the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
        §17 — Fire couldn’t be stopped. She’d get it, eventually. She only had
        to wait. Blood-letting would be even easier. The illusion of control
        would be thinner. A rare steak wouldn’t be enough, of course. The
        critical act, in that case, had occurred in the abattoir, where the
        hemophile demons gathered like excited flies. A trivial shaving or
        kitchen accident, on the other hand, should be quite sufficient. A mere
        nick, a single drop of blood, and it was done. He wondered how often he
        shed his own blood. Could it be less than once a week? There could be no
        security in this direction, or on this front. To seek protection here
        would be to court crippling neurosis.<br />
        If a blood-offering required intentional sacrifice, he would be safe. So
        it couldn’t be like that. Absence of safety was the starting point – the
        <em>axiom</em>. Design had been stripped away, down to the bedrock of
        raw accident.<br />
        Once intention was dismissed, everything was left open. The last
        recognizable factor was then deducted. The route would be unmarked, and
        uncharted. Figuratively, he was treading a cliff path in pitch darkness.
        A plunge into disaster was the default outcome. The first step, then,
        was to stop.<br />
        To go on as he had was no good. He had no idea what he was doing, which
        was intolerably dangerous now.<br />
        Any habit might be a building block, the modular component for a ritual.
        Safety lay only in <em>doing nothing</em>. He laughed bitterly at his
        plight.
      </p>
      <p>
        §18 — The entity visited his dreams. It was shadow become body, female
        and inhuman. Her avatar was a black leopard which was at the same time a
        wolf. The choice was not forced. Fluid ambivalence was her
        <em>gait</em>, as if she padded through the nocturnal forests of her
        natural realm. She was a familiar animal at first and then at once an
        unrecognizable predator. <em>You would make your mind a trap?</em> How
        could he not? His predicament necessitated at least that.<br />
        She was laughing at him, in a way that wasn’t simply unkind. There was
        nevertheless much of pitiless killing in her mirth. It amused her that
        all worlds were built upon darkness. Blood drew her. Predation was her
        play. There was an ambush underway that entirely out-witted him.<br />
        In the dreams he whirled around, dizzying himself. It would come from
        his flanks, or rear. In attempting to spot it, he spun. At once too slow
        to catch a glimpse of it, and too fast to bear, he would always
        stumble.<br />
        <em>When would it be?</em> With this question a time vortex swallowed
        him. He awakened, head-spinning, damp with half-remembered horrors.
      </p>
      <p>
        §19 — Time passed. Some few days became weeks – but no more than that.
        Duration had thickened. It was palpable to him now.<br />
        It could not be out-waited. It would not forget, or give up. It would be
        coming forever, and always had been. That was the oracle. Yet he had
        dreams of this, too, and they were tangled beyond straightening.
        Ambiguous grappling mixed desperation with something adopted from a wolf
        spider. <em>He was using her skills against her</em>, which meant things
        he didn’t want to contemplate. He had been waiting to trap her.<br />
        There had been no other option. Running was not a solution. She was too
        deeply lodged in the quick of duration to out-run. Flight ran out of
        time. In the grim dawn it was clearer, and emptier. No alternative was
        left. She would have to be defeated. Why not today? In delay there was
        no advantage. The initiative was no more denied to him now than it would
        ever be. A terrible impatience seized him, close to panic. He looked
        around. <em>I should get back</em>, he thought. Even if
        <em>she</em> cared little for space, it had to be less safe out here.
        The trees whispered eerily, as if in agreement. He stuck closely to the
        old wall, minimizing angles of potential attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        §20 — Suddenly – as if defining the word – a detonation shattered the
        stillness. It was extraordinarily shocking.<br />
        He stumbled, striking his head on a stone. The wound was superficial,
        but it bled freely. He dabbed at his torn scalp with a paper tissue,
        momentarily dazed.<br />
        Absurd hypotheses flooded in. Could it have been a minor meteorite
        impact? Had he been shot at? Nothing he could imagine made much
        sense.<br />
        The site of the explosion had been a nearby tree. A charred crater was
        apparent on its trunk, near the roots. The edges of the wound still
        smoldered. Scorching had emphasized the growth whorls. They were rings,
        surely, but a fracture-line had subtly shifted the pattern. The figure
        drew him in. He struggled to pull his mind back. Everything swirled. He
        was swept around the eddy of a swoon without quite succumbing to it. The
        crashing absurdity of the event still stunned him.<br />
        He sat for a moment, seeking to regroup his scattered faculties. His
        grasp on what had happened was – if anything – weakening. The fragments
        of recall continued drifting apart. The sole coherent sense was of an
        incomplete awakening. Only now had he begun to understand.
        <em>Only now</em> was what he had begun to understand. There was only
        now, even if he did not yet understand it, or ever would. Only now was
        happening, and he – truly – wasn’t. That’s how it went.
      </p>
      <p>
        §21 — Even in his befuddlement he knew more than he wanted to, far more
        than he had thought. Alien ideas had come to him along paths he did not
        recognize. Their grim magnificence appalled him.<br />
        <em>I have become a hunter</em>, he accepted. A feverish chill-wave
        washed through him, then, as he glimpsed what that might suggest. There
        was altogether too much likeness in it. He was imitating her. Was it, in
        fact, that she was <em>teaching</em> him? Thoughts that were still worse
        intruded, but they were harder to grasp. <em>I’m scared to think</em>,
        he admitted to himself. This undoubtedly compounded the danger.
        Psychological security procedures had been disabled, as if by hysterical
        paralysis. Certain strategically-indispensable positions had become too
        terrifying to defend. He had to laugh.
        <em>A garrison too frightened to man the walls</em> offered no
        protection. There was no survival that way. So instead, he twisted the
        blade of fear into himself, grimly determined to rouse his defenses. He
        would befriend his final horrors. <em>Love whatever hurts the most</em>.
        Only then might it somehow work out.
      </p>
      <p>
        §22 — There was nothing being said, because his mind had stopped
        guessing. It rested now amidst the uninterpretable-as-such. There was no
        sense, no possibility of sense. A kind of death had washed through him.
        Mystics had sought this place, he thought with a smile. The profanity of
        meaning was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        §23 — <em>It surely wouldn’t be long now</em>. The thought had already
        crystallized before its full wrongness struck him. Its impatience was
        the worst mistake. Attention was thus misdirected.
      </p>
      <p>
        §24 — He was aware of her now, continuously. It was less a sensation
        than – if such a thing were possible – <em>the opposite</em>. Was
        <em>nonsense</em> not precisely that, if literally understood? He
        thought of low meteorological pressure, of withdrawing tides,
        recessions. A palpable emptying left nothing to grasp at. Whatever it
        might have been had already departed.
      </p>
      <p>
        §25 — He lurked at the edge of the clearing. There was no need for even
        the slightest repositioning. It astounded him, that he was capable of
        such stillness. <em>Inhuman patience</em> was what it seemed to him
        then, momentarily. There was only the <em>beyond</em>, and nothing else.
        Here and now was being calmly considered, elsewhere. <em>This</em> was
        only bait. It was impossible. Bare survival had required nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
        §26 — All fear was forgotten. He was ready for her, and always had been.
        But it went much further. That which he had not so long ago thought
        himself to be would have shuddered at the stage it had reached. It was
        amusing, though not to the point of distraction. He had arrived at the
        place where everything stopped, or something had. It pointed nowhere
        else. The meaning was intrinsic, or it was nothing.
        <em>This is the time</em> went the lure. ‘This’ was what he had never
        before – and also always – taken himself as being. It had been crafted
        to hunt with.
      </p>
      <p>
        §27 — The Great Now had already begun, of course. The moment no longer
        gave way to another, but extended itself without boundary. Whatever
        <em>would</em> happen <em>was</em> happening, though unseen. Here was
        the secret of patience. It was far simpler than he had ever understood.
        There was simply nothing to wait for. Duration was compact. Unless
        momentarily stranded – apparently out of reach – by the cramping,
        rucking, or pleating of time, there was no longer any <em>up ahead</em>.
        To look forward was pure delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        §28 — An absolute act of predation was consummated, then, in primordial
        finality. There had been a quick, quiet killing. It was still now.
        Arrival and departure were fused in immensity.
      </p>
      <p>
        §29 — So, it was done.<br />
        It had always been done.<br />
        There was only this way, and no other. The hunter – alone – remained.

        <h4 class="post-title">Mermaids</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Katy was sleeping better. The dark patches beneath her eyes were
        disappearing. She even smiled now, occasionally. “I don’t mind the bad
        dreams about mermaids anymore,” she said.<br />
        “That’s good, why?”<br />
        “Daddy told me nightmares were the world’s only real treasure.”<br />
        “He said that?”<br />
        “Lots of times,” Katy said.<br />
        “He shouldn’t have. Those thoughts are unhealthy. They’re why he has had
        to spend so much time in hospital.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Claudia cast narrowed eyes around her
        daughter’s room. Though not especially untidy, the space was cluttered
        to a fantastic degree. It had the vivid quality of scarcely-inhibited
        psychological projection. Mermaids were an insistent theme. Two large
        mermaid posters dominated the largest wall. Even without any true
        insight into her daughter’s phobia, she still shuddered slightly. Their
        horror was directly proportional to the cognitive attention they drew.
        Thinking about them was bad. They were creatures of malevolent
        seduction. Sirens were mermaids.<br />
        “Why do you torture yourself like this?” Claudia had once asked her
        daughter, in frustration.<br />
        “I’d rather see them, than have them hide,” was the reply.<br />
        It made enough twisted sense to be unanswerable.<br />
        Katy had always been wise beyond her years. Her remarks were peculiarly
        <em>considered</em>. It made her seem sad.<br />
        Claudia wondered now whether there was something she should have said.
        Had there been an opening she’d missed?<br />
        There had never been a sign of Katy being disproportionately anxious
        about anything else. As a baby she’d been unusually solemn, but no less
        exceptionally calm. <em>The Little Buddha</em>, Derek had called her.
        She would very rarely cry. Nothing had seemed to profoundly upset her
        before this.<br />
        Why were mermaids so horrible? She felt the answer through powerful but
        indistinct intuition. Fluid boundaries were essential to it. A rocky
        sea-shore at twilight was darkly suggestive enough. It whispered of
        mermaids without needing to show them. Ambiguous transformations
        thrashed the coast of sleep.<br />
        “Do mermaids scare you, too, mommy?”<br />
        She’d wanted to say ‘no’ of course, but the word caught in her throat.
        She’d actually coughed – almost choked. “I don’t think about them much,”
        she’d managed, eventually. “They <em>are</em> kind of creepy, I
        guess.”<br />
        “Super-creepy,” Katy said.<br />
        “Why is that, do you think?” It was, perhaps, an incautious question,
        but Claudia couldn’t help herself.<br />
        “The join is the scariest part.”<br />
        “Where fish begins?”<br />
        “Or girl,” Katy said.<br />
        “Imagine being able to swim so well, though,” Claudia suggested, with
        unconvincing cheerfulness.<br />
        “That makes it worse, because you might want it.”

        <h4 class="post-title">Wallypede Girl</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Words can be an infected wound. Things are read that cannot be unread.
        They can injure, and fester.<br />
        For me, such words were delivered by a story, called
        <em>Wallypede Girl</em>. The title alone sufficed to betray its
        radically abominable character. It was a tale scraped from the filthiest
        sewers of Hell. You don’t need to know more than that. Believe me,
        really, you don’t. Thank all that is holy if you are spared. I pray you
        will not err as I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, my behavior is indecipherable
        to me. I watch a madman destroy himself. He picks up the slim volume
        whose vileness – <em>he knows</em> – has never been exceeded. As if
        craving damnation, he consumes it in one session. It took, perhaps,
        three hours.<br />
        <em>I could not put it down</em>, as the saying goes, though it explains
        nothing. Why – I now ask myself – did I continue to the end? Why proceed
        beyond the first hideous paragraph? I can make no sense of it. In any
        case, the private calamity was done. That was the first episode. I would
        never know ‘a good night’s sleep’ again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next episode, I was introduced to the author, at a gallery
        opening.<br />
        “I’m sure you told me that you’d read one of her stories. What was it
        called?”<br />
        Chillingly, I knew. <em>Please let it not be</em>, I mumbled silently,
        in vain. It was, of course. Had it not been, this also would not be. The
        words were said. I will not willingly repeat them.<br />
        After the name was spoken I seemed to pass – for a moment – out of the
        world. Sensation collapsed into darkness and noise. A buzzing reached me
        as if from distant ruined galaxies.<br />
        “You’ve heard of it?” she was asking. “Maybe you’ve even read it?”<br />
        I stared at her dumbly, if not quite open-mouthed. It was meeting a
        monster.<br />
        “How did you think up something like that?” I asked, not really wanting
        to know.<br />
        “Oh, it just came to me,” she said. The breeziness of the reply was
        almost impossibly distressing. “Do you ever have that? You know, when
        things just arrive, and you’ve no idea from where?”<br />
        “It doesn’t worry you?”<br />
        “Strange visitors are my favorite things.”<br />
        My look of abhorrence cannot have been well-concealed. Her expression
        shifted through discomfort to amusement.<br />
        “You look as if you’ve seen a Wallypede girl.”<br />
        “Don’t say that,” I begged. “I mean, don’t joke about it. It’s not
        remotely funny.”<br />
        “Are you okay?”<br />
        “What you did was so wrong.” I had to say it. “If there was any justice
        in this universe, you’d be punished for it.”<br />
        “Jesus,” she said. She looked taken aback. “You don’t like it?”<br />
        Her appalling understatement shocked me to the core. For some moments it
        stripped me of the power of speech. Could she somehow not realize what
        she had done?<br />
        “Like it?” I stammered, groping for more. “You find it imaginable that I
        could have <em>liked</em> it?”<br />
        “Aren’t scary stories your thing?”<br />
        I searched her face for indications of mockery. We were trapped in a
        dialog of unanswered questions. “You think what you wrote was a
        <em>scary story</em>?”<br />
        “Wasn’t it?” Once again, her confusion seemed genuine.<br />
        “Was Auschwitz-Birkenau undesirable accommodation?”<br />
        “I don’t get your point.” Some evidence of irritation was creeping
        in.<br />
        This tilted my sense of existential devastation into fury. Did she dare
        pretend to injury, after what she had done? I closed my eyes, grasping
        for calm.<br />
        “We should probably drop it,” she said. “The topic seems to over-excite
        you.”<br />
        <em>It’s not about me</em>, I wanted to shriek, but I managed to
        restrain myself. My temples ached. Throbbing veins probably betrayed my
        condition. I took a deep breath.<br />
        “You can’t be evading your responsibility,” I said. “Nobody would try to
        shrug-off something at this scale, surely? It would look too cynical,
        and – frankly – almost psychopathic.”<br />
        “What’s <em>wrong</em> with you?” she asked, openly annoyed now. “It’s a
        fucking story.”<br />
        “Oh is that all,” I replied, maximally accentuating the sarcasm. “For a
        moment there I thought it might – you know – actually matter.”<br />
        Despite its crudity, this response arrested her indignation in
        mid-flight. She seemed now to recognize something untenable about her
        position. The presumption of literary innocence visibly trembled.<br />
        “Who could it hurt?” she asked, in a shrunken voice. “It’s just a
        story.”<br />
        “Are you a Christian?” I asked.<br />
        She nodded, a little confusedly.<br />
        “So you think the Bible helps people, and perhaps even saves them?”<br />
        “It’s Jesus who saves people,” she said. “The Bible is only the Door to
        Him.”<br />
        I let <em>only</em> slip past. There was no need for it to get in the
        way. “So it’s a good door?”<br />
        “Of course,” she said.<br />
        Quietly, but firmly, I locked the trap. “Then you should be able to see
        the evil you’ve done, through simple inversion.”<br />
        It took her less than a second to see the connection. “No one could take
        <em>Wallypede Girl</em> as their Bible,” she protested. Her voice had
        risen, betraying hints of moral panic. She was beginning to imagine the
        horror of it. From the edge of anguished howl her words crashed back
        down to a hoarse whisper. “It would be monstrous.” As she explored the
        possibility, revulsion at her own thoughts spread glints of nightmare
        across her features. It seemed she might faint.<br />
        After some moments she regained composure. There was a deadness to her
        now, one I recognized – an installation of adamant despair. Elements of
        her expression were glazed with resignation to irreparable ruin.
        Laughter would not soon return, and when it did, it would be broken.<br />
        I could not quite pity her. She had ventured too deeply into the abyss
        for that.<br />
        The Hell of her own imaginings now claimed her.<br />
        “It was wrong,” she agreed, far too late.

        <h4 class="post-title">Things Left Mostly Unsaid (00)</h4>
      </a>
      <p>This series needs an introduction, but there isn’t one yet.</p>
      <p>
        §00 — He stared grimly at the ‘object’ – if that’s what it was. Some
        would call it one, of course, though without much conviction. There was
        an illusory unreality to it.<br />
        “It means nothing to me,” he said. “I don’t recognize it at all.”<br />
        “Are you sure?”<br />
        “For sure, I’m sure,” he insisted. “It’s not the sort of thing you’d
        forget.”<br />
        “I’d have thought it was exactly that sort of thing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How can you say that?” he asked, surprised.
        “It might have been made to be unmentioned.”<br />
        “You think it was made?”<br />
        He reconsidered. “It came from somewhere.”<br />
        Whatever it was, the exchange had been glitched by it, and
        disconnected.<br />
        “If it’s an artifact,” she said, with firm confidence, “it’s not
        ours.”<br />
        “We being?” he asked.<br />
        “Anything you can identify with will do.”<br />
        “Unless ‘artifact builders in general’.”<br />
        “That’s thinkable?”<br />
        He paused to reflect. “I guess it would be bold to say ‘yes’.”<br />
        “Heroic even,” she said.<br />
        “So talking about unthinkable artisans means talking around them.”<br />
        “If that’s the trajectory you’re on.”<br />
        “Consistent avoidance turns into an orbit, almost inevitably.”<br />
        “Continually missing something,” she agreed. “But that’s a trap, surely?
        You’re stuck to it.”<br />
        Yet stickiness kept its distance. The entity repelled contemplation. Its
        formlessness suggested no alleviating simplicity. The impression it made
        was elusive, hinting at immense bulk twisted into itself, or withdrawn
        into obscure dimensions.<br />
        “I really don’t like it,” he said childishly.<br />
        “No one expects you to.”<br />
        “Could we hand it over somehow?”<br />
        “Who’s going to take it?”<br />
        “We could just leave it here.”<br />
        “Be realistic.”<br />
        “Okay then,” he accepted. “What’s the next move?”<br />
        “First priority has to be not screwing this up,” she said. “We need to
        take our time.”<br />
        “Take it back, you mean?”<br />
        “If we can do that,” she concurred. “It’s not clear.”<br />
        They retreated from it slightly, as if by instinct. There was no sign of
        movement. Still, it indicated some kind of motionless shifting.
        Alternative patterns suggested themselves. Distances wouldn’t be
        changing much, apparently.<br />
        “How long do you think it will take?” he said after a while.<br />
        “As much as it’s able to, would be my guess.”<br />
        “We could use some expert assistance.”<br />
        “Spare us the happy thoughts.” If there were experts it would be an
        entirely different situation.<br />
        He’d been correct about the trajectory. It was like an orbit. The
        inclination to see more, without getting closer, produces circumspection
        automatically. Of course, neither was in any hurry to approach it, if
        that was even possible. Passive contact-aversion might not have been its
        primary property, but it appeared to be. The effect was repulsive. An
        inescapable thought was generated that it might somehow sting – very
        badly.<br />
        “Do you think we get out of this?” The remark was spun ironically, as if
        lifted from a movie.<br />
        “Why wouldn’t we?” The game was distracting. “There’s no need to
        exaggerate its malignancy.”<br />
        He tilted his head towards the thing, as if that was argument enough.<br />
        “I doubt it’s even hostile,” she said.<br />
        “Doubt how much?”<br />
        “It’s not done anything so far, or – at least – so far as we can
        tell.”<br />
        Everything was hidden in the qualification, and not deeply. To scrape at
        it would have been too crude.<br />
        “There’s no obvious end to this,” he said.

        §01 — The suggestion was peculiar. It raised many questions.<br />
        “So what do you think?”<br />
        “Nothing really,” he said, too quickly. That wouldn’t do, he realized.
        “Not much really,” he added, as a substitute. Then a query, for
        deflection: “What sort of thing?”<br />
        “What sort of thing are you thinking?” she repeated, with a laugh. “I’m
        supposed to know that?”<br />
        He’d forgotten what his question had meant. “Anyway, I’d rather not
        think about it,” he said. “Why dwell on such things?”<br />
        “So what – then – instead?” she asked.<br />
        “Does there have to be something?”<br />
        “Doesn’t there?”<br />
        “I suppose,” he admitted, obviously very far from thrilled about it.
        “Nothingness wouldn’t take enough time.”<br />
        He’d reached the crux. Duration had to be sponged-up somehow. Still, the
        proposition was questionable.<br />
        “Do you want to talk about it?” she asked, laughing again. The joke, if
        such it was, he found obscure.<br />
        “Is there any choice?” he grumbled. His own question was misleading, he
        knew at once. It wasn’t necessary to talk, at least not out loud, which
        was the thing. Yet, to keep from talking required a continual renewal.
        It involved effort. “It’s why people want to die,” he mused aloud. “It’s
        the only way to be quiet without trying.” The morbidity exceeded
        anything he would have wanted to say. “Always words,” he said. “They go
        too far.”<br />
        “Not always,” she countered. “Often, though, admittedly,” she added.
        “This time, certainly.”

      <p>
        §02 — It was too self-evident for words. Even this shouldn’t have
        required utterance. The redundancy echoed emptily through it. It added
        and then multiplied nothing. Nevertheless, it had crept into the
        conversation. Now he snapped at the intrusion.<br />
        “That goes without saying.”<br />
        “Yes, it has,” she said. “That’s its way.”<br />
        Her philosophical perversity struck him as glib and infuriating. “How
        can you even think that, let alone say it?” he demanded.<br />
        “Isn’t it obvious?”<br />
        “Of course it is,” he said. “It’s far too obvious. That’s the whole
        point.”<br />
        “So drop it. How difficult is that?”<br />
        He made an animal noise signaling rage mastered by humor. She laughed at
        it politely.<br />
        “You let it get to you too much,” she continued. “Why does it
        matter?”<br />
        “What kind of question is that?”<br />
        “You don’t like it?”<br />
        “Whether I like it or not isn’t the issue.”<br />
        “It wouldn’t be, if you cared less about it.”<br />
        “So it’s my fault now?”<br />
        The deflation was jolting. She could only laugh again, shaking her head.
        The way he fed it – while at the same time lamenting its prominence –
        was an extraordinary thing to see.<br />
        “You have to let it go,” she said, as soothingly as possible. “It’s not
        just going to get up and leave, while you’re worrying at it.”<br />
        “What if it has to be dealt with?”<br />
        “That’s your guess?”<br />
        “Regardless,” he insisted.<br />
        “It’s not asking anything of me.”<br />
        “Not as far as you can tell.”<br />
        ‘Tell’ was a word, she now realized, that she’d never listened to
        enough. Ancient sorceries hummed within it. “I can’t tell,” she tried,
        experimentally. “It’s hard to tell.” What might be telling?<br />
        “Are you even listening?” he wondered.<br />
        “I’m trying to.” She shook her head again, as if to clear it. “There’s a
        lot going on.”<br />
        “It only seems like that.”<br />
        “No,” she said. “It doesn’t. It seems as little as possible. Still
        though …”<br />
        “Still what?” he asked.<br />
        “Catching glimpses, whispers – there are chances.”<br />
        “‘Chances’ – Christ,” he said, without attempting to conceal his
        disgust. “That’s what you call them.”<br />
        “You’d prefer ‘curses’,” she knew, because they’d been there before.
        “But that’s unbalanced.”<br />
        “You can’t balance <em>this</em>.” It had always been his main point.
        “There’s no leverage.”<br />
        “Brains are sheer leverage.”<br />
        “They’re side-eddies.”<br />
        “That too,” she accepted. “But balancing is the only thing they do.”<br />
        “Or try to do.”<br />
        “That was built-in.” <em>Built-in to the statement</em>, she had meant,
        not the organ, though it worked equally either way. Over time it
        cancelled out. To be poised out at an edge was still to be poised. It
        wasn’t a matter of foundations, but of traffic.<br />
        “Okay, that’s enough,” he thought aloud, and it was.

      <p>
        §03 — She’d survived the event, however narrowly. Most probably, it was
        only melodrama that had placed such an outcome in doubt. There were no
        grounds for expecting anything worse. Yet it was as if she was still
        stricken. Her existence appeared somehow <em>thinned</em>.<br />
        A sheen of unseasonal perspiration glowed on her forehead.<br />
        “I don’t know,” she repeated, about nothing obvious. It was almost a
        plea. “I really don’t,” as if she couldn’t imaginably be believed.<br />
        Such stammering was not really speech, still less security. The seals
        and wards were far too weak. They offered no serious protection, or even
        the pretense of it.<br />
        He scrabbled at the enigma, quite undeterred by her distress. “So, what
        was it like?”<br />
        “There are no words.” She exaggerated, but only a little. Really, she
        had no idea where a description would begin. Perhaps there were too many
        words, but none for her, or none for it. The happening hadn’t been
        something meant for discussion. So the phrase was an alternative to
        saying more. It would have subtracted itself, if it could. In a way it
        disappeared, but incompletely. It left ripples, like something
        retreating into aquatic depths.<br />
        “There have to be words,” he insisted. “It isn’t necessary to be
        exact.”<br />
        “Vagueness in the right direction is already a lot to ask.”<br />
        His response was an inarticulate grunt of irritation. He was not here to
        fence. Was she not yet broken enough to be unguarded?<br />
        She ignored the tacit demand. There was too much <em>else</em> going
        on.<br />
        Impatience made him careless. “Spit it out,” he grumbled. He knew at
        once that exposing so much aggression was a mistake.<br />
        Her inner recoil was undisguised. Defenses would now compound the
        difficulty of the terrain.<br />
        He apologized clumsily, but too late.<br />
        “I’m tired,” he tried to explain. “I’ve been worried.”<br />
        “It’s okay,” she said, but the wariness in her eyes said something else.
        “I can’t really talk now.”<br />
        “Don’t say that.”<br />
        “It’s already too much,” she said, withdrawing further.<br />
        “Then who’s going to help?”<br />
        “Jesus,” she said, with a sad laugh. “Come on!”<br />
        He mumbled something even he himself missed. It was nothingness badly
        emulating speech. “I have to know,” he croaked. Despair was completing
        the loss of caution. “You understand, don’t you? I have to.”<br />
        “What if you simply can’t?” The complete absence of hostility in her
        tone somehow made it worse.<br />
        “No,” he said. “I won’t think that.”<br />
        “You can’t avoid it,” she said. “It’s settled.”<br />
        “Nothing’s settled.”<br />
        “You don’t believe that.”<br />
        “This isn’t about what I believe.”<br />
        “You don’t get to decide, either.” Once again, her tone was fatalistic,
        rather than accusing. “It’s the way it is.”<br />
        “You say that as if you’re on its side.”<br />
        “Everything’s on its side,” she countered. “Or nothing is.”

      <p>
        §04 — No one knew what it was, beside a scandal. Obscurity somehow
        occupied the center of it. <em>It’s not the crime but the cover-up</em>,
        as they say.<br />
        “Can you explain your involvement?” the reporter asked, thrusting a
        microphone forward aggressively. “Do you deny the accusations?”<br />
        <em>What accusations</em>? It would only encourage them.<br />
        There were other questions, being raised simultaneously. They blurred
        together into a hubbub of hostile inquisition.<br />
        “No comment.” He said it only to make his silence emphatic.<br />
        “This is an opportunity to set the record straight,” shouted someone
        else.<br />
        “Not really,” he mumbled, reaching the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        His wife was inside, slightly shaken, but
        still managing to smile. “They want you to talk,” she said.<br />
        “It’s all nonsense.”<br />
        “They think your silence is a confession.”<br />
        “I doubt it,” he said. He paused to consider. “They probably want me to
        think that.”<br />
        “Why do they even care?” she asked. “It’s all so – nothing.”<br />
        “They smell blood, it excites them.”<br />
        “You exaggerate,” she hoped.<br />
        “Maybe,” he accepted, unconvinced. He scratched the side of his nose
        distractedly.<br />
        “Are you going to make a statement?”<br />
        “You think I should?”<br />
        “It might be the only way to get out in front of things.”<br />
        “Improbable,” he muttered. “There’s no interest in what really
        happened.”<br />
        “You can’t just accept that.”<br />
        “Can’t I?” he asked. “Self-deception isn’t going to help.”<br />
        “If there’s a time for cynicism, this isn’t it,” she insisted. “It comes
        too close to vindicating their story-line.”<br />
        “If I was merely being accused of cynicism, I’d find it survivable,” he
        replied, with a grim laugh.<br />
        “So what are you being accused of, to your understanding?”<br />
        “Oh, you know.”<br />
        “Actually, I really don’t.”<br />
        “I’m supposed to have said some things.” He hesitated. “They’re vague
        about the details.”<br />
        “By ‘details’ you mean the actual words?”<br />
        “And the occasion,” he added.<br />
        “You’re talking about that ghastly club, aren’t you?” Her exasperation
        overflowed. “Why do you associate yourself with those people?”<br />
        “They’re good company.”<br />
        “They are <em>not</em> ‘good company’ – and now see where they’ve got
        you.”<br />
        “It’s hardly their fault,” he protested.<br />
        “Isn’t it, really? Then why is the press besieging our house?”<br />
        “You’re saying there was a leak?”<br />
        “What other explanation could there be?”<br />
        “I’m reluctant to jump to conclusions.” He realized in saying this that
        more would evidently be needed. “The place might have been bugged.”<br />
        “This is supposed to be more likely than you having sleazy friends?”<br />
        “I’m just admitting to uncertainty.”<br />
        She sighed dramatically, rolling her eyes. “You’re unbelievable. Can’t
        you see where this is going to end?”<br />
        “No, I can’t” he said. “I can’t at all, and I have to doubt that you
        can.”<br />
        “It’s as if you positively want to crash in flames.”<br />
        “How?” he protested. “How is it remotely like that?”<br />
        “Try to imagine what it looks like.”<br />
        “It looks mostly like the picture they want to paint.”<br />
        “They work with what they’ve got.”<br />
        He scowled, but without contesting the point. “It’s hard to know what
        they’ve got.”<br />
        “But knowing what they <em>could</em> have just requires
        recollection.”<br />
        “Some undiplomatic language,” he said, “but that’s all.”<br />
        “That’s quite enough, though, isn’t it?”<br />
        He sighed. “I think you’re approaching this the wrong way around.”<br />
        “You mean, from what actually happened?” she asked, only
        semi-sarcastically. “Let’s try to agree that’s at least relevant.”<br />
        “Minimally relevant,” he countered. “First of all, it’s a story.”<br />
        “It’s not a story about nothing, though, is it?”<br />
        “It’s a story about nothing-very-definite – at least so far.”<br />
        “But they clearly don’t expect it to be, for long.”<br />
        “Damn them,” he muttered, without further specifying who they were.
        “They won’t stop.”<br />
        “Why would they stop? The audience enjoys the chase.”<br />
        “What happened to ‘You exaggerate’?” he sniffed.<br />
        “You’ve changed my mind.”<br />
        “Anyway, I’m not feeding them.”<br />
        “Isn’t it a bit late for that?”

      <p>
        §05 — The interrogation would undoubtedly be difficult to navigate.
        There wasn’t any kind of sensible story to offer up. Some impure version
        of nothing was the only message available. That would seem odd. They’d
        want something.<br />
        He paced back and forth agitatedly, softly tortured by anticipation.
        “What if they ask about it directly?”<br />
        “They won’t.”<br />
        “But if they do?”<br />
        “Say as little as possible. Avoid lying, though, if you can. Lies are
        vulnerabilities. They tend to come apart under pressure. They release
        information when they break.” She paused a moment before continuing.
        “They can’t force you to talk.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “That’s true, probably,” he admitted, not
        entirely without bitterness. “But what would silence sound like to
        them?”<br />
        “You can’t afford to worry about that.”<br />
        “What can I afford?”<br />
        “Caution,” she said.<br />
        “That’s it?”<br />
        “That’s enough.”<br />
        It seemed unlikely. “I’m assuming they’re good at what they do.”<br />
        “Asking questions?”<br />
        “Roughly,” he accepted. He meant <em>approximately</em>.<br />
        The word took her elsewhere. “Not especially roughly,” she countered.
        “Their freedom is tightly constrained.”<br />
        Torture was close to the last thing he wanted to talk about. Yet, here
        they were.<br />
        “I’d tell them everything, if I could,” he muttered, unnecessarily.<br />
        She smiled thinly. “Thank you for the honesty.”<br />
        “Not that it matters.”<br />
        “Quite,” she agreed.<br />
        “There have to be words that would work,” he mused, “but how to find
        them?”<br />
        “You think there’s a method?”
        <em>A method you could conceivably follow in time</em>, she might have
        elaborated, which would have been colder.<br />
        There was no answer to it, in any case.<br />
        “Inaccessible possibilities seem like a theme,” he grumbled. “It starts
        and ends with them.”<br />
        “They divert you too much. You should concentrate upon what you can
        do.”<br />
        “You mean, <em>what I can avoid saying</em>.”<br />
        “Why reach for more than that – especially now?”<br />
        “‘Now’ is kind of the point, though, isn’t it?”<br />
        “Not unless you want to trip yourself up, at the worst time.”<br />
        “Yes, it would be better to forget.” The irritability had drained out,
        leaving only gloom. “Another inaccessible possibility,” he added.<br />
        She tapped her watch. <em>Time’s passing</em>. Words would only have
        softened the message.<br />
        “How long, do you think?” he asked.<br />
        “An hour or two, maybe,” she guessed. “Not long enough for
        <em>this</em>.”<br />
        “Or, maybe, for anything useful?” he said. “The opportunity cost of
        digression could be zero.”<br />
        “Only if you’re already fucked,” she said, her patience broken.<br />
        “Sometimes there’s nothing that can be done.”<br />
        “Isn’t that what you’re supposed to be planning?”<br />
        “Yeah, I guess,” he said, smiling awkwardly at her joke. He seemed bored
        by his own predicament.<br />
        “Best case you’ll get through on sheer apathy.”<br />
        “You think they’ll spin it out?”<br />
        “Why wouldn’t they? But it’s you who’ll be doing the spinning.”<br />
        “So the less I give them, the longer it takes,” he mused. “It’s a
        siege.”<br />
        The insight was too inane to remark upon. She felt mild relief he hadn’t
        posed it as a question.<br />
        “Not giving them anything is simply what’s going to happen,” she said.
        “That’s baked in. You have nothing. The problem begins when it seems
        you’re keeping something from them.”<br />
        “Which they have to,” he said, completing the circle.<br />
        “You see how easy it is to get nowhere? Keep that up at the right time,
        for a maximum of – probably – six hours, and you’re through.”<br />
        He groaned at the schedule.<br />
        “You’ll have to step-up the manifest compliance,” she added. “Any time
        that they think has been spent playing games won’t count.”<br />
        “Round and around,” he said.<br />
        “That’s the way. It’s not as if there’s another.”

      </a>
      <p>
        §06 — As always, she’d been exhaustingly elliptical. It seemed as if she
        never approached a point unless to curve about it. Her extreme
        circuitousness drew out the interrogator in him, which felt too much
        like work.<br />
        “What are you trying to say?” he asked wearily.<br />
        “‘Trying’ suggests failing,” she replied, immediately, with a laugh.<br />
        “What <em>are</em> you saying, then?”<br />
        “That’s better, but now redundant.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was always like this. “You’ve said a lot
        less than you think,” he muttered. It was pointless. She hid by nature.
        Irritable words wouldn’t draw her out.<br />
        She appraised him with cold neutrality now, wondering whether this was a
        fight. “Confession is a myth,” she said. “It collapses the question of
        evidence into intention. Information isn’t being held back. It isn’t
        <em>available</em>.”<br />
        “Sometimes, maybe,” he quibbled. He wasn’t going to grant her more than
        that, or in fact even that. “More often it’s withheld.”<br />
        “Sure, but <em>primordially</em>.” It was a word designed to up-end what
        remained of casual conversation. She smiled a little sadistically after
        uttering it.<br />
        “You mean, not by you?”<br />
        “Of course not by me,” she said, perhaps too quickly. Immediately, the
        ‘of course’ had seemed crude to the point of self-parody. They were
        speeding into stupidity again. Maybe it was the only thing that ever
        happened. She sighed.<br />
        He appeared to understand her frustration. An element of apology crept
        in. “Don’t let me rush you,” he said. “There’s time.”<br />
        “Meaning what?”<br />
        “Patience, I guess.”<br />
        “So you’re retreating from everything now?”<br />
        “Is that what’s happening?” The question was transparently insincere. He
        could almost feel himself stumbling backwards.<br />
        Perhaps it didn’t matter. The can could be kicked down the road, as they
        said. <em>There’d be another time</em>.<br />
        The thought unfolded through exactly those words. ‘They could pick it up
        again later’ was the whole of the initial conception. Yet – even
        unannounced – ‘another time’ seemed like the strangest idea supportable
        by the world. Reciprocally, <em>this time</em> became unbearable. The
        peculiarity was crushing. He backed away from this too, as if cornered.
        To think in the direction indicated would be like endless falling.<br />
        “You okay?” she asked. He’d paled oddly, staggering slightly, as if
        intoxicated.<br />
        “I was going to say something really weird,” he said, with an awkward
        laugh, “by accident.”<br />
        “But you didn’t.”<br />
        “No, I didn’t.” It felt alright, although that didn’t say much, either.
        There was relief as at an abyss missed.<br />
        She laughed too, though less awkwardly, which was nice. Then she put a
        finger to her lips, making the ‘hush’ sign.<br />
        They listened to nothing for a while, but it was hard to hear.
