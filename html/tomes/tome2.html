    <h1 class="block-title">BLOCK 1 - DARK ENLIGHTENMENT</h1>

    <section class="post">
      <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/the-dark-enlightenment-part-1/">
        <h4 class="post-title">The Dark Enlightenment (Part 1)</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>Neo-reactionaries head for the exit</em></h5>
      <p>
        Enlightenment is not only a state, but an event, and a process. As the
        designation for an historical episode, concentrated in northern Europe
        during the 18th century, it is a leading candidate for the ‘true name’
        of modernity, capturing its origin and essence (‘Renaissance’ and
        ‘Industrial Revolution’ are others). Between ‘enlightenment’ and
        ‘progressive enlightenment’ there is only an elusive difference, because
        illumination takes time – and feeds on itself, because enlightenment is
        self-confirming, its revelations ‘self-evident’, and because a
        retrograde, or reactionary, ‘dark enlightenment’ amounts almost to
        intrinsic contradiction. To become enlightened, in this historical
        sense, is to recognize, and then to pursue, a guiding light.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were ages of darkness, and then enlightenment came. Clearly,
        advance has demonstrated itself, offering not only improvement, but also
        a model. Furthermore, unlike a renaissance, there is no need for an
        enlightenment to recall what was lost, or to emphasize the attractions
        of return. The elementary acknowledgement of enlightenment is already
        <em>Whig history</em> in miniature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once certain enlightened truths have been found self-evident, there can
        be no turning back, and conservatism is pre-emptively condemned –
        predestined — to paradox. F. A. Hayek, who refused to describe himself
        as a conservative, famously settled instead upon the term ‘Old Whig’,
        which – like ‘classical liberal’ (or the still more melancholy
        ‘remnant’) – accepts that progress isn’t what it used to be. What could
        an Old Whig be, if not a reactionary progressive? And what on earth is
        that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, plenty of people already think they know what reactionary
        modernism looks like, and amidst the current collapse back into the
        1930s their concerns are only likely to grow. Basically, it’s what the
        ‘F’ word is for, at least in its progressive usage. A flight from
        democracy under these circumstances conforms so perfectly to
        expectations that it eludes specific recognition, appearing merely as an
        atavism, or confirmation of dire repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, something is happening, and it is – at least in part – something
        else. One milestone was the April 2009
        <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/april-2009/" target="_blank">discussion</a>
        hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri
        Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction
        and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual
        forthrightness. Thiel
        <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/the-education-of-a-libertarian/"
          target="_blank">summarized</a>
        the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are
        compatible.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2011, Michael Lind posted a democratic
        <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/lind_libertariansim/" target="_blank">riposte</a>
        at Salon, digging up some impressively malodorous dirt, and concluding:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The dread of democracy by libertarians and classical liberals is
            justified. Libertarianism really is incompatible with democracy.
            Most libertarians have made it clear which of the two they prefer.
            The only question that remains to be settled is why anyone should
            pay attention to libertarians.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Lind and the ‘neo-reactionaries’ seem to be in broad agreement that
        democracy is not only (or even) a <em>system</em>, but rather a
        <em>vector</em>, with an unmistakable direction. Democracy and
        ‘progressive democracy’ are synonymous, and indistinguishable from the
        expansion of the state. Whilst ‘extreme right wing’ governments have, on
        rare occasions, momentarily arrested this process, its reversal lies
        beyond the bounds of democratic possibility. Since winning elections is
        overwhelmingly a matter of vote buying, and society’s informational
        organs (education and media) are no more resistant to bribery than the
        electorate, a thrifty politician is simply an incompetent politician,
        and the democratic variant of Darwinism quickly eliminates such misfits
        from the gene pool. This is a reality that the left applauds, the
        establishment right grumpily accepts, and the libertarian right has
        ineffectively railed against. Increasingly, however, libertarians have
        ceased to care whether anyone is ‘pay[ing them] attention’ – they have
        been looking for something else entirely: an exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a structural inevitability that the libertarian voice is drowned
        out in democracy, and according to Lind it should be. Ever more
        libertarians are likely to agree. ‘Voice’ is democracy itself, in its
        historically dominant, Rousseauistic strain. It models the state as a
        representation of popular will, and making oneself heard means more
        politics. If voting as the mass self-expression of politically empowered
        peoples is a nightmare engulfing the world, adding to the hubbub doesn’t
        help. Even more than Equality-vs-Liberty, Voice-vs-Exit is the rising
        alternative, and libertarians are opting for voiceless flight. Patri
        Friedman
        <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/2008/05/nothing-against-bioshock/" target="_blank">remarks</a>: “we think
        that
        free exit is so important that we’ve called it the
        only Universal Human Right.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For the hardcore neo-reactionaries, democracy is not merely doomed, it
        is doom itself. Fleeing it approaches an ultimate imperative. The
        subterranean current that propels such anti-politics is recognizably
        Hobbesian, a coherent dark enlightenment, devoid from its beginning of
        any Rousseauistic enthusiasm for popular expression. Predisposed, in any
        case, to perceive the politically awakened masses as a howling
        irrational mob, it conceives the dynamics of democratization as
        fundamentally degenerative: systematically consolidating and
        exacerbating private vices, resentments, and deficiencies until they
        reach the level of collective criminality and comprehensive social
        corruption. The democratic politician and the electorate are bound
        together by a circuit of reciprocal incitement, in which each side
        drives the other to ever more shameless extremities of hooting, prancing
        cannibalism, until the only alternative to shouting is being eaten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the progressive enlightenment sees political ideals, the dark
        enlightenment sees appetites. It accepts that governments are made out
        of people, and that they will eat well. Setting its expectations as low
        as reasonably possible, it seeks only to spare civilization from
        frenzied, ruinous, gluttonous debauch. From Thomas Hobbes to
        Hans-Hermann Hoppe and beyond, it asks: How can the sovereign power be
        prevented – or at least dissuaded — from devouring society? It
        consistently finds democratic ‘solutions’ to this problem risible, at
        best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoppe advocates an anarcho-capitalist ‘private law society’, but between
        monarchy and democracy he does not hesitate (and his
        <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/1936/Anthony-Wile-with-Dr-Hans-Hermann-Hoppe-on-the-Impracticality-of-One-World-Government-and-Western-style-Democracy.html"
          target="_blank">argument</a>
        is strictly Hobbesian):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>As a hereditary monopolist, a king regards the territory and the
            people under his rule as his personal property and engages in the
            monopolistic exploitation of this &amp;quot;property.&amp;quot;
            Under democracy, monopoly and monopolistic exploitation do not
            disappear. Rather, what happens is this: instead of a king and a
            nobility who regard the country as their private property, a
            temporary and interchangeable caretaker is put in monopolistic
            charge of the country. The caretaker does not own the country, but
            as long as he is in office he is permitted to use it to his and his
            protégés’ advantage. He owns its current use – </em>usufruct<em>– but not its capital stock. This does not
            eliminate exploitation.
            To the contrary, it makes exploitation less calculating and carried
            out with little or no regard to the capital stock. Exploitation
            becomes shortsighted and capital consumption will be systematically
            promoted.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Political agents invested with transient authority by multi-party
        democratic systems have an overwhelming (and demonstrably irresistible)
        incentive to plunder society with the greatest possible rapidity and
        comprehensiveness. Anything they neglect to steal – or ‘leave on the
        table’ – is likely to be inherited by political successors who are not
        only unconnected, but actually opposed, and who can therefore be
        expected to utilize all available resources to the detriment of their
        foes. Whatever is left behind becomes a weapon in your enemy’s hand.
        Best, then, to destroy what cannot be stolen. From the perspective of a
        democratic politician, any type of social good that is neither directly
        appropriable nor attributable to (their own) partisan policy is sheer
        waste, and counts for nothing, whilst even the most grievous social
        misfortune – so long as it can be assigned to a prior administration or
        postponed until a subsequent one – figures in rational calculations as
        an obvious blessing. The long-range techno-economic improvements and
        associated accumulation of cultural capital that constituted social
        progress in its old (Whig) sense are in nobody’s political interest.
        Once democracy flourishes, they face the immediate threat of extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Civilization, as a process, is indistinguishable from diminishing
        time-preference (or declining concern for the present in comparison to
        the future). Democracy, which both in theory and evident historical fact
        accentuates time-preference to the point of convulsive feeding-frenzy,
        is thus as close to a precise negation of civilization as anything could
        be, short of instantaneous social collapse into murderous barbarism or
        zombie apocalypse (which it eventually leads to). As the democratic
        virus burns through society, painstakingly accumulated habits and
        attitudes of forward-thinking, prudential, human and industrial
        investment, are replaced by a sterile, orgiastic consumerism, financial
        incontinence, and a ‘reality television’ political circus. Tomorrow
        might belong to the other team, so it’s best to eat it all now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Winston Churchill, who remarked in neo-reactionary style that “the best
        argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the
        average voter“ is better known for suggesting “that democracy is the
        worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.”
        Whilst never exactly conceding that “OK, democracy sucks (in fact, it
        <em>really</em> sucks), but what’s the alternative?” the implication is
        obvious. The general tenor of this sensibility is attractive to modern
        conservatives, because it resonates with their wry, disillusioned
        acceptance of relentless civilizational deterioration, and with the
        associated intellectual apprehension of capitalism as an unappetizing
        but ineliminable default social arrangement, which remains after all
        catastrophic or merely impractical alternatives have been discarded. The
        market economy, on this understanding, is no more than a spontaneous
        survival strategy that stitches itself together amidst the ruins of a
        politically devastated world. Things will probably just get worse
        forever. So it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what is the alternative? (There’s certainly no point trawling
        through the 1930s for one.) “Can you imagine a 21st-century
        post-demotist society? One that saw itself as recovering from democracy,
        much as Eastern Europe sees itself as recovering from Communism?” asks
        supreme Sith Lord of the neo-reactionaries,
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Mencius Moldbug</a>. “Well, I suppose
        that
        makes one of us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug’s formative influences are Austro-libertarian, but that’s all
        over. As he explains:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… libertarians cannot present a realistic picture of a world in
            which their battle gets won and stays won. They wind up looking for
            ways to push a world in which the State’s natural downhill path is
            to grow, back up the hill. This prospect is Sisyphean, and it’s
            understandable why it attracts so few supporters.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        His awakening into neo-reaction comes with the (Hobbesian) recognition
        that sovereignty cannot be eliminated, caged, or controlled.
        Anarcho-capitalist utopias can never condense out of science fiction,
        divided powers flow back together like a shattered Terminator, and
        constitutions have exactly as much real authority as a sovereign
        interpretative power allows them to have. The state isn’t going anywhere
        because — to those who run it — it’s worth far too much to give up, and
        as the concentrated instantiation of sovereignty in society, nobody can
        make it do anything. If the state cannot be eliminated, Moldbug argues,
        at least it can be cured <em>of democracy</em> (or systematic and
        degenerative bad government), and the way to do that is to
        <em>formalize</em> it. This is an approach he calls ‘neo-cameralism’.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country. A
            state should be managed, like any other large business, by dividing
            logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a
            precise fraction of the state’s profit. (A well-run state is very
            profitable.) Each share has one vote, and the shareholders elect a
            board, which hires and fires managers.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>This business’s customers are its residents. A profitably-managed
            neocameralist state will, like any business, serve its customers
            efficiently and effectively. Misgovernment equals mismanagement.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Firstly, it is essential to squash the democratic myth that a state
        ‘belongs’ to the citizenry. The point of neo-cameralism is to buy out
        the real stakeholders in sovereign power, not to perpetuate sentimental
        lies about mass enfranchisement. Unless ownership of the state is
        formally transferred into the hands of its actual rulers, the
        neo-cameral transition will simply not take place, power will remain in
        the shadows, and the democratic farce will continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, secondly, the ruling class must be plausibly identified. It should
        be noted immediately, in contradistinction to Marxist principles of
        social analysis, that this is not the ‘capitalist bourgeoisie’.
        Logically, it cannot be. The power of the business class is already
        clearly formalized, in monetary terms, so the identification of capital
        with political power is perfectly redundant. It is necessary to ask,
        rather, <em>who do capitalists pay for political favors</em>, how much
        these favors are potentially worth, and how the authority to grant them
        is distributed. This requires, with a minimum of moral irritation, that
        the entire social landscape of political bribery (‘lobbying’) is exactly
        mapped, and the administrative, legislative, judicial, media, and
        academic privileges accessed by such bribes are converted into fungible
        shares. Insofar as voters are worth bribing, there is no need to
        entirely exclude them from this calculation, although their portion of
        sovereignty will be estimated with appropriate derision. The conclusion
        of this exercise is the mapping of a ruling entity that is the truly
        dominant instance of the democratic polity. Moldbug calls it
        <em>the Cathedral</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formalization of political powers, thirdly, allows for the
        possibility of effective government. Once the universe of democratic
        corruption is converted into a (freely transferable) shareholding in
        <em>gov-corp.</em> the owners of the state can initiate rational
        corporate governance, beginning with the appointment of a CEO. As with
        any business, the interests of the state are now precisely formalized as
        the maximization of long-term shareholder value. There is no longer any
        need for residents (clients) to take any interest in politics
        whatsoever. In fact, to do so would be to exhibit semi-criminal
        proclivities. If <em>gov-corp</em> doesn’t deliver acceptable value for
        its taxes (sovereign rent), they can notify its customer service
        function, and if necessary take their custom elsewhere.
        <em>Gov-corp</em> would concentrate upon running an efficient,
        attractive, vital, clean, and secure country, of a kind that is able to
        draw customers. No voice, free exit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… although the full neocameralist approach has never been tried,
            its closest historical equivalents to this approach are the
            18th-century tradition of enlightened absolutism as represented by
            Frederick the Great, and the 21st-century nondemocratic tradition as
            seen in lost fragments of the British Empire such as Hong Kong,
            Singapore and Dubai. These states appear to provide a very high
            quality of service to their citizens, with no meaningful democracy
            at all. They have minimal crime and high levels of personal and
            economic freedom. They tend to be quite prosperous. They are weak
            only in political freedom, and political freedom is unimportant by
            definition when government is stable and effective.</em>

        In European classical antiquity, democracy was recognized as a familiar
        phase of cyclical political development, fundamentally decadent in
        nature, and preliminary to a slide into tyranny. Today this classical
        understanding is thoroughly lost, and replaced by a global democratic
        ideology, entirely lacking in critical self-reflection, that is asserted
        not as a credible social-scientific thesis, or even as a spontaneous
        popular aspiration, but rather as a religious creed, of a specific,
        historically identifiable kind:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… a received tradition I call Universalism, which is a nontheistic
            Christian sect. Some other current labels for this same tradition,
            more or less synonymous, are progressivism, multiculturalism,
            liberalism, humanism, leftism, political correctness, and the like.
            … Universalism is the dominant modern branch of Christianity on the
            Calvinist line, evolving from the English Dissenter or Puritan
            tradition through the Unitarian, Transcendentalist, and Progressive
            movements. Its ancestral briar patch also includes a few sideways
            sprigs that are important enough to name but whose Christian
            ancestry is slightly better concealed, such as Rousseauvian laicism,
            Benthamite utilitarianism, Reformed Judaism, Comtean positivism,
            German Idealism, Marxist scientific socialism, Sartrean
            existentialism, Heideggerian postmodernism, etc, etc, etc. …
            Universalism, in my opinion, is best described as a </em>mystery cult of power<em>. … It’s as hard to
            imagine
            Universalism without the State as
            malaria without the mosquito. … The point is that this thing,
            whatever you care to call it, is at least two hundred years old and
            probably more like five. It’s basically the Reformation itself. …
            And just walking up to it and denouncing it as evil is about as
            likely to work as suing Shub-Niggurath in small-claims court.</em>

        Googling ‘democracy’ and ‘liberty’ together is highly enlightening, in a
        dark way. In cyberspace, at least, it is clear that only a distinct
        minority think of these terms as positively coupled. If opinion is to be
        judged in terms of the Google spider and its digital prey, by far the
        most prevalent association is disjunctive, or antagonistic, drawing upon
        the reactionary insight that democracy poses a lethal menace to liberty,
        all but ensuring its eventual eradication. Democracy is to liberty as
        Gargantua to a pie (“Surely you can see that we love liberty, to the
        point of gut-rumbling and salivation …”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve H. Hanke lays out the case authoritatively in his short
        <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/democracy-versus-liberty" target="_blank">essay</a>
        <em>On Democracy Versus Liberty</em>, focused upon the American
        experience:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Most people, including most Americans, would be surprised to learn
            that the word “democracy” does not appear in the Declaration of
            Independence (1776) or the Constitution of the United States of
            America (1789). They would also be shocked to learn the reason for
            the absence of the word democracy in the founding documents of the
            U.S.A. Contrary to what propaganda has led the public to believe,
            America’s Founding Fathers were skeptical and anxious about
            democracy. They were aware of the evils that accompany a tyranny of
            the majority. The Framers of the Constitution went to great lengths
            to ensure that the federal government was not based on the will of
            the majority and was not, therefore, democratic.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If the Framers of the Constitution did not embrace democracy, what
            did they adhere to? To a man, the Framers agreed that the purpose of
            government was to secure citizens in John Locke’s trilogy of the
            rights to life, liberty and property.
          </em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He elaborates:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The Constitution is primarily a structural and procedural document
            that itemizes who is to exercise power and how they are to exercise
            it. A great deal of stress is placed on the separation of powers and
            the checks and balances in the system. These were not a Cartesian
            construct or formula aimed at social engineering, but a shield to
            protect the people from the government. In short, the Constitution
            was designed to govern the government, not the people.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The Bill of Rights establishes the rights of the people against
            infringements by the State. The only thing that the citizens can
            demand from the State, under the Bill of Rights, is for a trial by a
            jury. The rest of the citizens’ rights are protections from the
            State. For roughly a century after the Constitution was ratified,
            private property, contracts and free internal trade within the
            United States were sacred. The scope and scale of the government
            remained very constrained. All this was very consistent with what
            was understood to be liberty.</em>
        </p>

        As the spirit of reaction digs its Sith-tentacles into the brain, it
        becomes difficult to remember how the classical (or non-communist)
        progressive narrative could once have made sense. What were people
        thinking? What were they expecting from the emerging super-empowered,
        populist, cannibalistic state? Wasn’t the eventual calamity entirely
        predictable? How was it ever possible to be a Whig?
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideological credibility of radical democratization is not, of
        course, in question. As thinkers ranging from (Christian progressive)
        Walter Russell Mead to (atheistic reactionary) Mencius Moldbug have
        exhaustively detailed, it conforms so exactly to ultra-protestant
        religious enthusiasm that its power to animate the revolutionary soul
        should surprise nobody. Within just a few years of Martin Luther’s
        challenge to the papal establishment, peasant insurrectionists were
        stringing up their class enemies all over Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        The empirical credibility of democratic advancement is far more
        perplexing, and also genuinely complex (which is to say controversial,
        or more precisely, worthy of a data-based, rigorously-argued
        controversy). In part, that is because the modern configuration of
        democracy emerges within the sweep of a far broader modernistic trend,
        whose techno-scientific, economic, social and political strands are
        obscurely interrelated, knitted together by misleading correlations, and
        subsequent false causalities. If, as Schumpeter argues, industrial
        capitalism tends to engender a democratic-bureaucratic culture that
        concludes in stagnation, it might nevertheless seem as though democracy
        was ‘associated’ with material progress. It is easy to misconstrue a
        lagging indicator as a positive causal factor, especially when
        ideological zeal lends its bias to the misapprehension. In similar vein,
        since cancer only afflicts living beings, it might – with apparent
        reason — be associated with vitality.

            political quest. Why? Because positive recent trends in these areas
            were not much </em>caused
          <em>by such political movements! They were mostly caused by our getting
            rich from the industrial revolution, an event that political
            movements tended, if anything, to try to hold back on average.</em>

        Simple historical chronology suggests that industrialization supports
        progressive democratization, rather than being derived from it. This
        observation has even given rise to a widely accepted school of pop
        social science theorizing, according to which the ‘maturation’ of
        societies in a democratic direction is determined by thresholds of
        affluence, or middle-class formation. The strict logical correlate of
        such ideas, that democracy is <em>fundamentally non-productive</em> in
        relation to material progress, is typically under-emphasized. Democracy
        <em>consumes</em> progress. When perceived from the perspective of the
        dark enlightenment, the appropriate mode of analysis for studying the
        democratic phenomenon is general parasitology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quasi-libertarian responses to the outbreak accept this implicitly.
        Given a population deeply infected by the zombie virus and shambling
        into cannibalistic social collapse, the preferred option is quarantine.
        It is not communicative isolation that is essential, but a functional
        dis-solidarization of society that tightens feedback loops and exposes
        people with maximum intensity to the consequences of their own actions.
        Social solidarity, in precise contrast, is the parasite’s friend. By
        cropping out all high-frequency feedback mechanisms (such as market
        signals), and replacing them with sluggish, infra-red loops that pass
        through a centralized forum of ‘general will’, a radically democratized
        society insulates parasitism from what it does, transforming local,
        painfully dysfunctional, intolerable, and thus urgently corrected
        behavior patterns into global, numbed, and chronic socio-political
        pathologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Gnaw off other people’s body parts and it might be hard to get a
          job</em>– that’s the kind of lesson a tight-feedback, cybernetically intense,
        <em>laissez faire</em> order would allow to be learned. It’s also
        exactly the kind of insensitive zombiphobic discrimination that any
        compassionate democracy would denounce as thought crime, whilst boosting
        the public budget for the vitally-challenged, undertaking consciousness
        raising campaigns on behalf of those suffering from involuntary
        cannibalistic impulse syndrome, affirming the dignity of the zombie
        lifestyle in higher-education curriculums, and rigorously regulating
        workspaces to ensure that the shuffling undead are not victimized by
        profit-obsessed, performance-centric, or even unreconstructed
        animationist employers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As enlightened zombie-tolerance flourishes in the shelter of the
        democratic mega-parasite, a small remnant of reactionaries, attentive to
        the effects of real incentives, raise the formulaic question: “You do
        realize that these policies lead inevitably to a massive expansion of
        the zombie population?” The dominant vector of history presupposes that
        such nuisance objections are marginalized, ignored, and — wherever
        possible – silenced through social ostracism. The remnant either
        fortifies the basement, whilst stocking up on dried food, ammunition,
        and silver coins, or accelerates the application process for a second
        passport, and starts packing its bags.
      </p>
      <p>
        If all of this seems to be coming unmoored from historical concreteness,
        there’s a conveniently topical remedy: a little digressive
        channel-hopping over to Greece. As a microcosmic model for the death of
        the West, playing out in real time, the Greek story is hypnotic. It
        describes a 2,500 year arc that is far from neat, but irresistibly
        dramatic, from proto-democracy to accomplished zombie apocalypse. Its
        pre-eminent virtue is that it perfectly illustrates the democratic
        mechanism <em>in extremis</em>, separating individuals and local
        populations from the consequences of their decisions by scrambling their
        behavior through large-scale, centralized re-distribution systems. You
        decide what you do, but then vote on the consequences. How could anyone
        say ‘no’ to that?
      </p>
      <p>
        No surprise that over 30 years of EU membership Greeks have been eagerly
        cooperating with a social-engineering mega-project that strips out all
        short-wave social signals and re-routes feedback through the grandiose
        circuitry of European solidarity, ensuring that all
        economically-relevant information is red-shifted through the heat-death
        sump of the
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/ex-ecbs-juergen-stark-says-ecbs-balance-sheet-gigantic-collateral-quality-shocking"
          target="_blank">European Central Bank</a>. Most specifically, it has conspired with ‘Europe’ to obliterate all
        information that might be contained in Greek interest rates, thus
        effectively disabling all financial feedback on domestic policy choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is democracy in a consummate form that defies further perfection,
        since nothing conforms more exactly to the ‘general will’ than the
        legislative abolition of reality, and nothing delivers the hemlock to
        reality more definitively than the coupling of Teutonic interest rates
        with East Mediterranean spending decisions.
        <em>Live like Hellenes and pay like Germans</em> — any political party
        that failed to rise to power on that platform deserves to scrabble for
        vulture-picked scraps in the wilderness. It’s the ultimate
        <em>no-brainer</em>, in just about every imaginable sense of that
        expression. What could possibly go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        More to the point, what did go wrong? Mencius Moldbug begins his
        <em>Unqualified Reservations</em> series
        <em>How Dawkins got pwned</em> (or taken over through an “exploitable
        vulnerability”) with the

        of design rules for a hypothetical “optimal memetic parasite” that would
        be “as virulent as possible. It will be highly contagious, highly
        morbid, and highly persistent. A really ugly bug.” In comparison to this
        ideological super-plague, the vestigial monotheism derided in
        <em>The God Delusion</em> would figure as nothing worse than a
        moderately unpleasant head cold. What begins as abstract meme tinkering
        concludes as grand-sweep history, in the dark enlightenment

            a remarkable match for the Ranter, Leveller, Digger, Quaker, Fifth
            Monarchist, or any of the more extreme English Dissenter traditions
            that flourished during the Cromwellian interregnum.</em>

          <em>Frankly, these dudes were freaks. Maniacal fanatics. Any mainstream

            this tradition (or its modern descendant) is now the planet’s
            dominant Christian denomination, would regard this as a sign of
            imminent apocalypse. If you’re sure they’re wrong, you’re more sure
            than me.</em>

          <em>Fortunately, Cromwell himself was comparatively moderate. The

            and Cromwellism died with him. Lawful government was restored to
            Great Britain, as was the Church of England, and Dissenters became a
            marginal fringe again. And frankly, a damned good riddance it
            was.</em>

          <em>However, you can’t keep a good parasite down. A community of

            the War of Secession, American Puritanism was well on the way to
            world domination. Its victories in World War I, World War II, and
            the Cold War confirmed its global hegemony. All legitimate
            mainstream thought on Earth today is descended from the American
            Puritans, and through them the English Dissenters.</em>

      <p>
        Given the rise of this “really ugly bug” to world dominion, it might
        seem strange to pick on tangential figure such as Dawkins, but Moldbug
        selects his target for exquisitely-judged strategic reasons. Moldbug
        identifies with Dawkins’ Darwinism, with his intellectual repudiation of
        Abrahamic theism, and with his broad commitment to scientific
        rationality. Yet he recognizes, crucially, that Dawkins’ critical
        faculties shut off – abruptly and often comically – at the point where
        they might endanger a still broader commitment to hegemonic
        progressivism. In this way, Dawkins is powerfully indicative. Militant
        secularism is itself a modernized variant of the Abrahamic meta-meme, on
        its Anglo-Protestant, radical democratic taxonomic branch,
        <em>whose specific tradition is anti-traditionalism</em>. The clamorous
        atheism of <em>The God Delusion</em> represents a protective feint, and
        a consistent upgrade of religious reformation, guided by a spirit of
        progressive enthusiasm that trumps empiricism and reason, whilst
        exemplifying an irritable dogmatism that rivals anything to be found in
        earlier God-themed strains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dawkins isn’t merely an enlightened modern progressive and implicit
        radical democrat, he’s an impressively credentialed scientist, more
        specifically a biologist, and (thus) a Darwinian evolutionist. The point
        at which he touches the limit of acceptable thinking as defined by the
        memetic super-bug is therefore quite easy to anticipate. His inherited
        tradition of low-church ultra-protestantism has replaced God with Man as
        the locus of spiritual investment, and ‘Man’ has been in the process of
        Darwinian research dissolution for over 150 years. (As the sound, decent
        person I know you are, having gotten this far with Moldbug you’re
        probably already muttering under your breath,
        <em>don’t mention race, don’t mention race, don’t mention race, please,
          oh please, in the name of the Zeitgeist and the dear sweet non-god of
          progress, don’t mention race …</em>) … but Moldbug is
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html"
          target="_blank">already</a>
        citing Dawkins, citing Thomas Huxley “…in a contest which is to be
        carried out by thoughts and not by bites. The highest places in the
        hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our
        dusky cousins.” Which Dawkins frames by remarking: “Had Huxley… been
        born and educated in our time, [he] would have been the first to cringe
        with us at [his] Victorian sentiments and unctuous tone. I quote them
        only to illustrate how the <em>Zeitgeist</em> moves on.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It gets worse. Moldbug seems to be holding Huxley’s hand, and … (ewww!)
        doing that palm-stroking thing with his finger. This sure ain’t
        vanilla-libertarian reaction anymore — it’s getting seriously dark, and
        scary. “In all seriousness, what is the evidence for fraternism? Why,
        exactly, does Professor Dawkins believe that all neohominids are born
        with identical potential for neurological development? He doesn’t say.
        Perhaps he thinks it’s obvious.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever one’s opinion on the respective scientific merits of human
        biological diversity or uniformity, it is surely beyond contention that
        the latter assumption, alone, is <em>tolerated</em>. Even if
        progressive-universalistic beliefs about human nature are true, they are
        not held <em>because they are true</em>, or arrived at through any
        process that passes the laugh test for critical scientific rationality.
        They are received as religious tenets, with all of the passionate
        intensity that characterizes essential items of faith, and to question
        them is not a matter of scientific inaccuracy, but of what we now call
        <em>political incorrectness</em>, and once knew as <em>heresy</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sustain this transcendent moral posture in relation to
        <em>racism</em> is no more rational than subscription to the doctrine of
        <em>original sin</em>, of which it is, in any case, the unmistakable
        modern substitute. The difference, of course, is that ‘original sin’ is
        a traditional doctrine, subscribed to by an embattled social cohort,
        significantly under-represented among public intellectuals and media
        figures, deeply unfashionable in the dominant world culture, and widely
        criticized – if not derided – without any immediate assumption that the
        critic is advocating murder, theft, or adultery. To question the status
        of racism as the supreme and defining social sin, on the other hand, is
        to court universal condemnation from social elites, and to arouse
        suspicions of <em>thought crimes</em> that range from pro-slavery
        apologetics to genocide fantasies. Racism is
        <em>pure or absolute evil</em>, whose proper sphere is the infinite and
        the eternal, or the incendiary sinful depths of the hyper-protestant
        soul, rather than the mundane confines of civil interaction, social
        scientific realism, or efficient and proportional legality. The
        dissymmetry of affect, sanction, and raw social power attending old
        heresies and their replacements, once noticed, is a nagging indicator. A
        new sect reigns, and it is not even especially well hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet even among the most hardened HBD constituencies, hysterical
        sanctification of plus-good race-think hardly suffices to lend radical
        democracy the aura of profound morbidity that Moldbug detects. That
        requires a devotional relation to the State.

      <p>
        The previous installment of this series ended with our hero Mencius
        Moldbug, up to his waist (or worse) in the mephitic swamp of political
        incorrectness, approaching the dark heart of his politico-religious
        meditation on <em>How Dawkins Got Pwned</em>. Moldbug has caught Dawkins
        in the midst of a symptomatically significant, and excruciatingly
        sanctimonious, denunciation of Thomas Huxley’s racist “Victorian
        sentiments” – a sermon which concludes with the strange declaration that
        he is quoting Huxley’s words, despite their self-evident and wholly
        intolerable ghastliness, “only to illustrate how the
        <em>Zeitgeist</em> moves on.”

        Moldbug
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-3.html"
          target="_blank">pounces</a>, asking pointedly: “What, exactly, is this <em>Zeitgeist</em> thing?”
        It is, indisputably, an extraordinary catch. Here is a thinker
        (Dawkins), trained as a biologist, and especially fascinated by the
        (disjunctively) twinned topics of naturalistic evolution and Abrahamic
        religion, stumbling upon what he apprehends as a one-way trend of
        world-historical spiritual development, which he then – emphatically,
        but without the slightest appeal to disciplined reason or evidence –
        denies has any serious connection to the advance of science, human
        biology, or religious tradition. The stammering nonsense that results is
        a thing of wonder, but for Moldbug it all makes sense:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>In fact, Professor Dawkins’ </em>Zeitgeist<em>
            is … indistinguishable from … the old Anglo-Calvinist or Puritan
            concept of </em>Providence<em>. Perhaps this is a false match. But it’s quite a close one.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Another word for </em>Zeitgeist<em> is </em>Progress<em>. It’s unsurprising that Universalists tend to
            believe in </em>Progress<em>– in fact, in a political context, they often call themselves
          </em>progressives<em>. Universalism has indeed made quite a bit of progress since </em>[the time of Huxley’s
          embarrassing remark in]
          <em>1913. But this hardly refutes the proposition that Universalism is
            a parasitic tradition. Progress for the tick is not progress for the
            dog.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What, exactly, is this <em>Zeitgeist</em> thing? The question bears
        repeating. Is it not astounding, to begin with, that when one English
        Darwinian reaches for a weapon to club another, the most convenient
        cudgel to hand should be a German word — associated with an abstruse
        lineage of state-worshipping idealistic philosophy — explicitly
        referencing a conception of historical time that has no discernible
        connection to the process of naturalistic evolution? It is as if,
        scarcely imaginably, during a comparable contention among physicists (on
        the topic of quantum indeterminacy), one should suddenly hear it shouted
        that “God does not play dice with the universe.” In fact, the two
        examples are intimately entangled, since Dawkins’ faith in the
        <em>Zeitgeist</em> is combined with adherence to the dogmatic
        progressivism of ‘Einsteinian Religion’ (meticulously
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-1.html"
          target="_blank">dissected</a>, of course, by Moldbug).
      </p>
      <p>
        The shamelessness is remarkable, or at least it would be, were it
        naively believed that the protocols of scientific rationality occupied
        sovereign position in such disputation, if only in principle. In fact –
        and here irony is amplified to the very brink of howling psychosis –
        Einstein’s Old One still reigns. The criteria of judgment owe everything
        to neo-puritan spiritual hygiene, and nothing whatsoever to testable
        reality. Scientific utterance is screened for conformity to a
        progressive social agenda, whose authority seems to be unaffected by its
        complete indifference to scientific integrity. It reminds Moldbug of
        Lysenko, for understandable reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If the facts do not agree with the theory, so much worse for the facts”
        Hegel asserted. It is the <em>Zeitgeist</em> that is God, historically
        incarnated in the state, trampling mere data back into the dirt. By now,
        everybody knows where this ends. An egalitarian moral ideal, hardened
        into a universal axiom or increasingly incontestable dogma, completes
        modernity’s supreme historical irony by making ‘tolerance’ the iron
        criterion for the limits of (cultural) toleration. Once it is accepted
        universally, or, speaking more practically, by all social forces
        wielding significant cultural power, that
        <em>intolerance is intolerable</em>, political authority has legitimated
        anything and everything convenient to itself, without restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the magic of the dialectic, or of logical perversity. When only
        <em>tolerance is tolerable</em>, and everyone (who matters) accepts this
        manifestly nonsensical formula as not only rationally intelligible, but
        as the universally-affirmed principle of modern democratic faith,
        nothing except politics remains. Perfect tolerance and absolute
        intolerance have become logically indistinguishable, with either equally
        interpretable as the other, A = not-A, or the inverse, and in the
        nakedly Orwellian world that results, power alone holds the keys of
        articulation. Tolerance has progressed to such a degree that it has
        become a social police function, providing the existential pretext for
        new inquisitional institutions. (“We must remember that those who
        tolerate intolerance abuse tolerance itself, and an enemy of tolerance
        is an enemy of democracy,” Moldbug
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2011/07/petition-against-reactosphere.html"
          target="_blank">ironizes</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The spontaneous tolerance that characterized classical liberalism,
        rooted in a modest set of strictly negative rights that restricted the
        domain of politics, or government intolerance, surrenders during the
        democratic surge-tide to a positive <em>right to be tolerated</em>,
        defined ever more expansively as substantial entitlement, encompassing
        public affirmations of dignity, state-enforced guarantees of equal
        treatment by all agents (public and private), government protections
        against non-physical slights and humiliations, economic subsidies, and –
        ultimately – statistically proportional representation within all fields
        of employment, achievement, and recognition. That the eschatological
        culmination of this trend is simply impossible matters not at all to the
        dialectic. On the contrary, it energizes the political process,
        combusting any threat of policy satiation in the fuel of infinite
        grievance. “I will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall my Sword sleep
        in my hand: Till we have built Jerusalem, In England’s green and
        pleasant land.” Somewhere before Jerusalem is reached, the inarticulate
        pluralism of a free society has been transformed into the assertive
        multiculturalism of a soft-totalitarian democracy.

        The Jews of 17th century Amsterdam, or the Huguenots of 18th century
        London, enjoyed the right to be left alone, and enriched their host
        societies in return. The democratically-empowered grievance groups of
        later modern times are incited by political leaders to demand a
        (fundamentally illiberal) <em>right to be heard</em>, with social
        consequences that are predominantly malignant. For politicians, however,
        who identify and promote themselves as the voice of the unheard and the
        ignored, the self-interest at stake could hardly be more obvious.

        Tolerance, which once presupposed neglect, now decries it, and in so
        doing becomes its opposite. Were this a partisan development, partisan
        politics of a democratic kind might sustain the possibility of
        reversion, but it is nothing of the kind. “When someone is hurting,
        government has got to move” declared ‘compassionate conservative’ US
        President George W. Bush, in a futile effort to channel the Cathedral.
        When the ‘right’ sounds like this it is not only dead, but unmistakably
        reeking of advanced decomposition. ‘Progress’ has won, but is that bad?

        the question rigorously:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>If a tradition causes its hosts to make miscalculations that
            compromise their personal goals, it exhibits Misesian morbidity. If
            it causes its hosts to act in ways that compromise their genes’
            reproductive interests, it exhibits Darwinian morbidity. If
            subscribing to the tradition is individually advantageous or neutral
            (defectors are rewarded, or at least unpunished) but collectively
            harmful, the tradition is parasitic. If subscribing is individually
            disadvantageous but collectively beneficial, the tradition is
            altruistic. If it is both individually and collectively benign, it
            is symbiotic. If it is both individually and collectively harmful,
            it is malignant. Each of these labels can be applied to either
            Misesian or Darwinian morbidity. A theme that is arational, but does
            not exhibit either Misesian or Darwinian morbidity, is trivially
            morbid.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Behaviorally considered, the Misesian and Darwinian systems are clusters
        of ‘selfish’ incentives, oriented respectively to property accumulation
        and gene propagation. Whilst the Darwinians conceive the ‘Misesian’
        sphere as a special case of genetically self-interested motivation, the
        Austrian tradition, rooted in highly rationalized neo-kantian
        anti-naturalism, is pre-disposed to resist such reductionism. Whilst the
        ultimate implications of this contest are considerable, under current
        conditions it is a squabble of minor urgency, since both formations are
        united in ‘hate’, which is to say, in their reactionary tolerance for
        incentive structures that punish the maladapted.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Hate’ is a word to pause over. It testifies with special clarity to the
        religious orthodoxy of the Cathedral, and its peculiarities merit
        careful notice. Perhaps its most remarkable feature is its perfect
        redundancy, when evaluated from the perspective of any analysis of legal
        and cultural norms that is <em>not</em> enflamed by neo-puritan
        evangelical enthusiasm. A ‘hate crime’, if it is anything at all, is
        just a crime, plus ‘hate’, and what the ‘hate’ adds is telling. To
        restrict ourselves, momentarily, to examples of uncontroversial
        criminality, one might ask: what is it exactly that
        <em>aggravates</em> a murder, or assault, if the motivation is
        attributed to ‘hate’? Two factors seem especially prominent, and neither
        has any obvious connection to common legal norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, the crime is augmented by a purely ideational, ideological, or
        even ‘spiritual’ element, attesting not only to a violation of civilized
        conduct, but also to a heretical intention. This facilitates the
        complete abstraction of hate from criminality, whereupon it takes the
        form of ‘hate-speech’ or simply ‘hate’ (which is always to be contrasted
        with the ‘passion’, ‘outrage’, or righteous ‘anger’ represented by
        critical, controversial, or merely abusive language directed against
        unprotected groups, social categories, or individuals). ‘Hate’ is an
        offense against the Cathedral itself, a refusal of its spiritual
        guidance, and a mental act of defiance against the manifest religious
        destiny of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, and relatedly, ‘hate’ is deliberately and even strategically
        asymmetrical in respect to the equilibrium political polarity of
        advanced democratic societies. Between the relentless march of progress
        and the ineffective grouching of conservatism it does not vacillate. As
        we have seen, only the right can ‘hate’. As the doxological immunity
        system of ‘hate’ suppression is consolidated within elite educational
        and media systems, the highly selective distribution of protections
        ensures that ‘discourse’ – especially empowered discourse – is ratcheted
        consistently to the left, which is to say, in the direction of an ever
        more comprehensively radicalized Universalism. The morbidity of this
        trend is extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because grievance status is awarded as political compensation for
        economic incompetence, it constructs an automatic cultural mechanism
        that advocates for dysfunction. The Universalist creed, with its reflex
        identification of inequality with injustice, can conceive no alternative
        to the proposition that the lower one’s situation or status, the more
        compelling is one’s claim upon society, the purer and nobler one’s
        cause. Temporal failure is the sign of spiritual election
        (Marxo-Calvinism), and to dispute any of this is clearly ‘hate’.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not compel even the most hard-hearted neo-reactionary to
        suggest, in a caricature of the high Victorian cultural style, that
        social disadvantage, as manifested in political violence, criminality,
        homelessness, insolvency, and welfare dependency, is a simple index of
        moral culpability. In large part – perhaps overwhelmingly large part –
        it reflects sheer misfortune. Dim, impulsive, unhealthy, and
        unattractive people, reared chaotically in abusive families, and
        stranded in broken, crime-wracked communities, have every reason to
        curse the gods before themselves. Besides, disaster can strike anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to effective incentive structures, however, none of this is
        of the slightest importance. Behavioral reality knows only one iron law:
        Whatever is subsidized is promoted. With a necessity no weaker than that
        of entropy itself, insofar as social democracy seeks to soften bad
        consequences – for major corporations no less than for struggling
        individuals or hapless cultures — things get worse. There is no way
        around, or beyond this formula, only wishful thinking, and complicity
        with degeneration. Of course, this defining reactionary insight is
        doomed to inconsequence, since it amounts to the supremely unpalatable
        conclusion that every attempt at ‘progressive’ improvement is fated to
        reverse itself, ‘perversely’, into horrible failure. No democracy could
        accept this, which means that every democracy will fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The excited spiral of Misesian-Darwinian degenerative runaway is neatly
        captured in the
        <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/04/europe-8217-s-real-crisis/8915/"
          target="_blank">words</a>
        of the world’s fluffiest Beltway libertarian, Megan McArdle, writing in
        core Cathedral-mouthpiece <em>The Atlantic</em>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>It is somewhat ironic that the first serious strains caused by
            Europe’s changing demographics are showing up in the Continent’s
            welfare budgets, because the pension systems themselves may well
            have shaped, and limited, Europe’s growth. The 20th century saw
            international adoption of social-security systems that promised
            defined benefits paid out of future tax revenue—known to pension
            experts as “paygo” systems, and to critics as Ponzi schemes. These
            systems have greatly eased fears of a destitute old age, but
            multiple studies show that as social-security systems become more
            generous (and old age more secure), people have fewer children. By
            one estimate, 50 to 60 percent of the difference between America’s
            (above-replacement) birthrate and Europe’s can be explained by the
            latter’s more generous systems. In other words, Europe’s pension
            system may have set in motion the very demographic decline that
            helped make that system—and some European governments—insolvent.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Despite McArdle’s ridiculous suggestion that the United States of
        America has in some way exempted itself from Europe’s mortuary path, the
        broad outline of the diagnosis is clear, and increasingly accepted as
        commonsensical (although best ignored). According to the rising creed,
        welfare attained through progeny and savings is non-universal, and thus
        morally-benighted. It should be supplanted, as widely and rapidly as
        possible, by universal benefits or ‘positive rights’ distributed
        universally to the democratic citizen and thus, inevitably, routed
        through the altruistic State. If as a result, due to the irredeemable
        political incorrectness of reality, economies and populations should
        collapse in concert, at least it will not damage our souls. Oh
        democracy! You saccharine-sweet dying idiot, what do you think the
        zombie hordes will care for your soul?

        Without a taste for irony, Mencius Moldbug is all but unendurable, and
        certainly unintelligible. Vast structures of historical irony shape his
        writings, at times even engulfing them. How otherwise could a proponent
        of traditional configurations of social order – a self-proclaimed
        Jacobite – compose a body of work that is stubbornly dedicated to
        subversion?
      </p>
      <p>
        Irony is Moldbug’s method, as well as his milieu. This can be seen, most
        tellingly, in his chosen name for the usurped enlightenment, the
        dominant faith of the modern world: Universalism. This is a word that he
        appropriates (and capitalizes) within a reactionary diagnosis whose
        entire force lies in its exposure of an exorbitant particularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug turns continually to history (or, more rigorously,
        <em>cladistics</em>), to accurately specify that which asserts its own
        universal significance whilst ascending to a state of general dominance
        that approaches the universal. Under this examination, what counts as
        Universal reason, determining the direction and meaning of modernity, is
        revealed as the minutely determined branch or sub-species of a cultic
        tradition, descended from ‘ranters’, ‘levelers’, and closely related
        variants of dissident, ultra-protestant fanaticism, and owing
        vanishingly little to the conclusions of logicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, then, the world’s regnant
        <em>Universalist</em> democratic-egalitarian faith is a particular or
        peculiar cult that has <em>broken out</em>, along identifiable
        historical and geographical pathways, with an epidemic virulence that is
        disguised as progressive global enlightenment. The route that it has
        taken, through England and New England, Reformation and Revolution, is
        recorded by an accumulation of traits that provide abundant material for
        irony, and for lower varieties of comedy. The unmasking of the modern
        ‘liberal’ intellectual or ‘open-minded’ media ‘truth-teller’ as a pale,
        fervent, narrowly doctrinaire puritan, recognizably descended from the
        species of witch-burning zealots, is reliably – and irresistibly –
        entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, as the Cathedral extends and tightens its grip upon everything,
        everywhere, in accordance with its divine mandate, the response it
        triggers is only atypically humorous. More commonly, when unable to
        exact humble compliance, it encounters inarticulate rage, or at least
        uncomprehending, smoldering resentment, as befits the imposition of
        parochial cultural dogmas, still wrapped in the trappings of a specific,
        alien pedigree, even as they earnestly confess to universal rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider, for instance, the most famous words of America’s
        <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html" rel="noopener"
          target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a>: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
        created
        equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
        Rights …” Could it be honestly maintained that to submit, scrupulously
        and sincerely, to such ‘self-evident’ truths amounts to anything other
        than an act of religious re-confirmation or conversion? Or denied that,
        in these words, reason and evidence are explicitly <em>set aside</em>,
        to make room for principles of faith? Could anything be less scientific
        than such a declaration, or more indifferent to the criteria of
        genuinely universal reasoning? How could anybody who was
        <em>not already a believer</em> be expected to consent to such
        assumptions?
      </p>
      <p>
        That the founding statement of the democratic-republican creed should be
        formulated as a statement of pure (and doctrinally recognizable) faith
        is information of sorts, but it is not yet irony. The irony begins with
        the fact that among the elites of today’s Cathedral, these words of the
        Declaration of Independence (as well as many others) would be found –
        almost universally – to be quaintly suggestive at best, perhaps vaguely
        embarrassing, and most certainly incapable of supporting literal assent.
        Even amongst libertarian-slanted conservatives, a firm commitment to
        ‘natural rights’ is unlikely to proceed confidently and emphatically to
        their divine origination. For modern ‘liberals’, believers in the
        rights-bestowing (or entitlement) State, such archaic ideas are not only
        absurdly dated, but positively obstructive. For that reason, they are
        associated less with revered predecessors than with the retarded,
        fundamentalist thinking of political enemies. Sophisticates of the
        Cathedral core understand, as Hegel did, that God is no more than deep
        government apprehended by infants, and as such a waste of faith (that
        bureaucrats could put to better use).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Cathedral has ascended to global supremacy, it no longer has
        need for Founding Fathers, who awkwardly recall its parochial ancestry,
        and impede its transnational public relations. Rather, it seeks
        perpetual re-invigoration through their denigration. The phenomenon of
        the ‘New Atheism’, with its transparent progressive affiliations,
        attests abundantly to this. Paleo-puritanism must be derided in order
        for neo-puritanism to flourish –
        <em>the meme is dead, long live the meme!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the limit of self-parody, neo-puritan parricide takes the form of the
        ludicrous ‘War on Christmas’, in which the allies of the Cathedral
        sanctify the (radically unthreatened) separation of Church and State
        through nuisance agitation against public expressions of traditional
        Christian piety, and their ‘Red State’ dupes respond with dyspeptic
        outrage on cable TV shows. Like every other war against fuzzy nouns
        (whether ‘poverty’, ‘drugs’, or ‘terror’), the outcome is predictably
        perverse. If resistance to the War on Christmas is not yet established
        as the solid center of Yuletide festivities, it can be confidently
        expected to become so in the future. The purposes of the Cathedral are
        served nonetheless, through promotion of a synthetic secularism that
        separates the progressive faith from its religious foundations, whilst
        directing attention away from the ethnically specific, dogmatic creedal
        content at its core.
      </p>
      <p>
        As reactionaries go, traditional Christians are generally considered to
        be quite cuddly. Even the most wild-eyed fanatics of the neo-puritan
        orthodoxy have trouble getting genuinely excited about them (although
        abortion activists get close). For some real red meat, with the nerves
        exposed and writhing to jolts of hard stimulation, it makes far more
        sense to turn to another discarded and ceremonially abominated block on

          rel="noopener" target="_blank">opts for</a>) ‘white nationalism’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as the ratchet progress of neo-puritan social democracy is
        radically facilitated by the orchestrated pillorying of its embryonic
        religious forms, so is its trend to consistently neo-fascist political
        economy smoothed by the concerted repudiation of a ‘neo-nazi’ (or
        paleo-fascist) threat. It is extremely convenient, when constructing
        ever more nakedly corporatist or ‘third position’ structures of
        state-directed pseudo-capitalism, to be able to divert attention to
        angry expressions of white racial paranoia, especially when these are
        ornamented by clumsily modified nazi insignia, horned helmets, Leni
        Riefenstahl aesthetics, and slogans borrowed freely from
        <em>Mein Kampf</em>. In the United States (and thus, with shrinking
        time-lag, internationally) the icons of the Ku Klux Klan, from white
        bed-sheets, quasi-Masonic titles, and burning crosses, to lynching
        ropes, have acquired comparable theatrical value.

        Moldbug offers a sanitized white nationalist blog reading list,
        consisting of writers who – to varying degrees of success – avoid
        immediate reversion to paleo-fascist self-parody. The first step beyond
        the boundary of respectable opinion is represented by
        <a href="http://amnation.com/vfr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lawrence Auster</a>, a Christian,
        anti-Darwinist, and ‘Traditionalist Conservative’ who
        defends ‘substantial’ (ethno-racial) national identity and opposes the
        liberal master-principle of nondiscrimination. By the time we reach ‘<a
          href="http://age-of-treason.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tanstaafl</a>’, at the ripped
        outer
        edge of Moldbug’s carefully truncated
        spectrum,
        we have entered a decaying orbit, spiraling into the great black hole
        that is hidden at the dead center of modern political possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before following the Tanstaafl-types into the crushing abyss where light
        dies, there are some preliminary remarks to make about the white
        nationalist perspective, and its implications. Even more than the
        Christian traditionalists (who, even in their cultural mid-winter, can
        bask in the warmth of supernatural endorsement), white identity politics
        considers itself <em>besieged</em>. Moderate or measured concern offers
        no equilibrium for those who cross the line, and begin to self-identify
        in these terms. Instead, the path of involvement demands rapid
        acceleration to a state of extreme alarm, or racial panic, conforming to
        an analysis focused upon malicious population replacement at the hands
        of a government which, in the oft-cited words of Bertolt Brecht, “has
        decided to dissolve the people, and to appoint another one.” ‘Whiteness’
        (whether conceived biologically, mystically, or both) is associated with
        vulnerability, fragility, and persecution. This theme is so basic, and
        so multifarious, that it is difficult to adequately address succinctly.
        It encompasses everything from criminal predation (especially
        racially-charged murders, rapes, and beatings), economic exactions and
        inverse discrimination, cultural aggression by hostile academic and
        media systems, and ultimately ‘genocide’ – or definitive racial
        destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, the prospective annihilation of the white race is attributed
        to its own systematic vulnerability, whether due to characteristic
        cultural traits (excessive altruism, susceptibility to moral
        manipulation, excessive hospitality, trust, universal reciprocity,
        guilt, or individualistic disdain for group identity), or more immediate
        biological factors (recessive genes supporting fragile Aryan
        phenotypes). Whilst it is unlikely that this sense of unique
        endangerment is reducible to the chromatic formula ‘White + Color =
        Color’, the fundamental structure is of this kind. In its abstract
        depiction of non-reciprocal vulnerability, it reflects the ‘one drop
        rule’ (and Mendelian recessive / dominant gene combination). It depicts
        mixture as essentially anti-white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because ‘whiteness’ is a limit (pure absence of color), it slips
        smoothly from the biological factuality of the Caucasian sub-species
        into metaphysical and mystical ideas. Rather than accumulating genetic
        variation, a white race is contaminated or polluted by admixtures that
        compromise its defining negativity – to darken it is to destroy it. The
        mythological density of these — predominantly subliminal – associations
        invests white identity politics with a resilience that frustrates
        enlightened efforts at rationalistic denunciation, whilst contradicting
        its own paranoid self-representation. It also undermines recent white
        nationalist promotions of a racial threat that is strictly comparable to
        that facing indigenous peoples, universally, and depicting whites as
        ‘natives’ cruelly deprived of equal protection against extinction. There
        is no route back to tribal innocence, or flat, biological diversity.
        Whiteness has been compacted indissolubly with ideology, whichever the
        road taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If Blacks can have it, and Hispanics can have it, and Jews can have it,
        why can’t we have it?” – That’s the final building block of white
        nationalist grievance, the werewolf curse that means it can only ever be
        a monster. There’s exactly one way out for persecuted palefaces, and it
        leads straight into a black hole. We promised to get back to Tanstaafl,
        and

          Jew
          thing</a>’. There isn’t anything very original about his epiphany, which is
        exactly the point. He quotes himself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Isn’t it absurd that anyone would even think to blame Christianity
            or WASPs for the rise of PC and its catastrophic consequences? Isn’t
            this in fact a reversal of the truth? Hasn’t the rise and spread of
            PC eroded the power of Christianity, WASPs, and whites in general?
            Blaming them is in effect blaming the victim.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Yes, there are Christians, WASPs, and whites who have fallen for
            the PC brainwashing. Yes, there are some who have taken it so deeply
            to heart that they work to expand and protect it. That’s the nature
            of PC. That is its purpose. To control the minds of the people it
            seeks to destroy. The left, at its root, is all about
            destruction.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>You don’t have to be an anti-Semite to notice where these ideas
            originate from and who benefits. But you do have to violate PC to
            say: Jews.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That’s the labyrinth, the trap, with its pitifully constricted,
        stereotypical circuit. “Why can’t we be cuddly racial preservationists,
        like Amazonian Indians? How come we always turn into Neo-Nazis? It’s
        some kind of conspiracy, which means <em>it has to be the Jews</em>.”
        Since the mid-20th century, the political intensity of the globalized
        world has streamed, almost exclusively, out of the cratered ash-pile of
        the Third Reich. Until you get the pattern, it seems mysterious that
        there’s no getting away from it. After listing some blogs falling under
        the relatively genteel category of ‘white nationalism’, Moldbug
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html"

        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Google is overkill. A little link-trawling will get you there. It’s a
        ‘six degrees of separation’ problem (and more like two, or less). Start
        digging into the actually existing ‘reactosphere’, and things get quite
        astoundingly ugly very quickly. Yes, there really is ‘hate’, panic, and
        disgust, as well as a morbidly addictive abundance of very grim,
        vitriolic wit, and a disconcertingly impressive weight of credible fact
        (these guys just <em>love</em> statistics to death). Most of all, just
        beyond the horizon, there’s the black hole. If reaction ever became a
        popular movement, its few slender threads of bourgeois (or perhaps
        dreamily ‘aristocratic’) civility wouldn’t hold back the beast for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        As liberal decency has severed itself from intellectual integrity, and
        exiled harsh truths, these truths have found new allies, and become
        considerably harsher. The outcome is mechanically, and monotonously,
        predictable. Every liberal democratic ‘cause war’ strengthens and
        feralizes what it fights. The war on poverty creates a chronically
        dysfunctional underclass. The war on drugs creates crystallized
        super-drugs and mega-mafias. Guess what? The war on political
        incorrectness creates data-empowered, web-coordinated, paranoid and
        poly-conspiratorial werewolves, superbly positioned to take advantage of
        liberal democracy’s impending rendezvous with ruinous reality, and to
        then play their part in the unleashing of unpleasantnesses that are
        scarcely imaginable (except by disturbing historical analogy). When a
        sane, pragmatic, and fact-based negotiation of human differences is
        <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/james-watson-tells-inconvenient-truth_296.php" rel="noopener"
          target="_blank">forbidden by ideological fiat</a>, the alternative is not a reign of perpetual peace, but a
        festering of
        increasingly self-conscious and militantantly defiant
        <em>thoughtcrime</em>, nourished by publicly unavowable realities, and
        energized by powerful, atavistic, and palpably dissident mythologies.
        That’s obvious, on the ‘Net.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moldbug considers the danger of white nationalism to be both over- and
        understated. On the one hand, the ‘menace’ is simply ridiculous, and
        merely reflects neo-puritan spiritual dogma in its most hysterically
        oppressive and stubbornly mindless form. “It should be obvious that,
        although I am not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the
        stuff,” Moldbug remarks, before describing it as “the most marginalized
        and socially excluded belief system in the history of the world … an
        obnoxious social irritant in any circle which does not include tattooed
        speedfreak bikers.”
      </p>
      <p>Yet the danger remains, or rather, is <em>under construction</em>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>I can imagine one possibility which might make white nationalism
            genuinely dangerous. White nationalism would be dangerous if there
            was some issue on which white nationalists were right, and everyone
            else was wrong. Truth is always dangerous. Contrary to common
            belief, it does not always prevail. But it’s always a bad idea to
            turn your back on it. …While the evidence for human cognitive
            biodiversity is indeed debatable, what’s not debatable is that it is
            debatable …</em>[even though]<em>
            everyone who is not a white nationalist has spent the last 50 years
            informing us that it is not debatable …
          </em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There’s far more to Moldbug’s essay, as there always is. Eventually it
        explains why he rejects white nationalism, on grounds that owe nothing
        to conventional reflexes. But the dark heart of the essay, lifting it
        beyond brilliance to the brink of genius, is found early on, at the edge
        of a black hole:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Why does white nationalism strike us as evil? Because Hitler was a
            white nationalist, and Hitler was evil. Neither of these statements
            is remotely controvertible. There is exactly one degree of
            separation between white nationalism and evil. And that degree is
            Hitler. Let me repeat: Hitler.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The argument seems watertight. (Hitlertight?) But it holds no water
            at all.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Why does socialism strike us as evil? Because Stalin was a
            socialist, and Stalin was evil. Anyone who wants to seriously argue
            that Stalin was less evil than Hitler has an awful long row to hoe.
            Not only did Stalin order more murders, his murder machine had its
            heyday in peacetime, whereas Hitler’s can at least be seen as a war
            crime against enemy civilians. Whether this makes a difference can
            be debated, but if it does it puts Stalin on top.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And yet I have never had or seen anything like the “red flags”
            response to socialism </em>[“the sense of the presence of evil”]<em>. If I saw a crowd of young,
            fashionable
            people lining up at the
            box office for a hagiographic biopic on Reinhard Heydrich, chills
            would run up and down my neck. For Ernesto Guevara, I have no
            emotional response. Perhaps I think it’s stupid and sad. I do think
            it’s stupid and sad. But it doesn’t freak me out.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Any attempt to be nuanced, balanced, or proportional in the moral case
        against Hitler is to entirely misconstrue the nature of the phenomenon.
        This can be noted, quite regularly, in Asian societies, for instance,
        because the ghost of the Third Reich does not occupy central position in
        their history, or rather, <em>their religion</em>, although – as the
        inner sanctum of the Cathedral — it is determined to (and shows almost
        every sign of succeeding). A brief digression on cross-cultural
        misunderstanding and reciprocal blindness might be merited at this
        point. When Westerners pay attention to the ‘God-Emperor’ style of
        political devotion that has accompanied modern totalitarianism in East
        Asia, the conclusion typically drawn is that this pattern of political
        feeling is exotically alien, morbidly amusing, and ultimately –
        chillingly — incomprehensible. Contemporary comparisons with laughably
        non-numinous Western democratic leaders only deepen the confusion, as do
        clumsy quasi-Marxist references to ‘feudal’ sensibilities (as if
        absolute monarchy was not an <em>alternative</em> to feudalism, and as
        if absolute monarchs were worshipped).
        <em>How could a historical and political figure ever be invested with the
          transcendent dignity of absolute religious meaning?</em>
        It seems absurd …
      </p>
      <p>
        “Look, I’m not saying that Hitler was a particularly nice guy …” – to
        imagine such word is already to see many things. It might even provoke
        the question: Does anybody within the (Cathedral’s) globalized world
        still think that Adolf Hitler was less evil than the Prince of Darkness
        himself? Perhaps only a few scattered paleo-Christians (who stubbornly
        insist that Satan is really, <em>really</em> bad), and an even smaller
        number of Neo-Nazi ultras (who think Hitler was kind of cool). For
        pretty much everybody else, Hitler <em>perfectly</em> personifies
        demonic monstrosity, transcending history and politics to attain the
        stature of a metaphysical absolute: evil incarnate. Beyond Hitler it is
        impossible to go, or think. This is surely interesting, since it
        indicates an irruption of the infinite within history – a religious
        revelation, of inverted, yet structurally familiar, Abrahamic type.
        (‘Holocaust Theology’ already implies as much.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In this regard, rather than Satan, it might be more helpful to compare
        Hitler to the Antichrist, which is to say: to a mirror Messiah, of
        reversed moral polarity. There was even an empty tomb.
        <em>Hitlerism</em>, neutrally conceived, therefore, is less a pro-Nazi
        ideology than a universal faith, speciated within the Abrahamic
        super-family, and united in acknowledging the coming of pure evil on
        earth. Whilst not exactly worshipped (outside the extraordinarily
        disreputable circles already ventured into), Hitler is sacramentally
        abhorred, in a way that touches upon theological ‘first things’. If to
        embrace Hitler as God is a sign of highly lamentable politico-spiritual
        confusion (at best), to recognize his historical singularity and sacred
        meaning is near-mandatory, since he is affirmed by all men of sound
        faith as the exact complement of the incarnate God (the revealed
        anti-Messiah, or Adversary), and this identification has the force of
        ‘self-evident truth’. (Did anybody ever need to ask why the
        <em>reductio ad Hitlerum</em> works?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Conveniently, like the secularized neo-puritanism that it swallows,
        (aversive) Hitlerism can be safely taught in American schools, at a
        remarkably high level of religious intensity. Insofar as progressive or
        programmatic history continues, this suggests that the Church of Sacred
        Hitlerite Abomination will eventually supplant its Abrahamic
        predecessors, to become the world’s triumphant ecumenical faith. How
        could it not? After all, unlike vanilla deism, this is a faith that
        fully reconciles religious enthusiasm with enlightened opinion, equally
        adapted, with consummate amphibious capability, to the convulsive
        ecstasies of popular ritual and the letter pages of the
        <em>New York Times</em>. “Absolute evil once walked amongst us, and
        lives still …” How is this not, already, the principal religious message
        of our time? All that remains unfinished is the mythological
        consolidation, and that has long been underway.

        There is no part of Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, or very many
        other East Asian cities where it is impossible to wander, safely, late
        at night. Women, whether young or old, on their own or with small
        children, can be comfortably oblivious to the details of space and time,
        at least insofar as the threat of assault is concerned. Whilst this
        might not be quite sufficient to define a civilized society, it comes
        extremely close. It is certainly <em>necessary</em> to any such
        definition. The contrary case is barbarism.
      </p>
      <p>
        These lucky cities of the western Pacific Rim are typified by
        geographical locations and demographic profiles that conspicuously echo
        the embarrassingly well-behaved ‘model minorities’ of Occidental
        countries. They are (non-obnoxiously) dominated by populations that –
        due to biological heredity, deep cultural traditions, or some
        inextricable entanglement of the two – find polite, prudent, and pacific
        social interactions comparatively effortless, and worthy of continuous
        reinforcement. They are also, importantly, open, cosmopolitan societies,
        remarkably devoid of chauvinistic boorishness or paranoid
        ethno-nationalist sentiment. Their citizens are disinclined to emphasize
        their own virtues. On the contrary, they will typically be modest about
        their individual and collective attributes and achievements, abnormally
        sensitive to their failures and shortcomings, and constantly alert to
        opportunities for improvement. Complacency is almost as rare as
        delinquency. In these cities an entire — and massively consequential —
        dimension of social terror is simply absent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In much of the Western world, in stark contrast, barbarism has been
        normalized. It is considered simply obvious that cities have ‘bad areas’
        that are not merely impoverished, but lethally menacing to outsiders and
        residents alike. Visitors are warned to stay away, whilst locals do
        their best to transform their homes into fortresses, avoid venturing
        onto the streets after dark, and – especially if young and male — turn
        to criminal gangs for protection, which further degrades the security of
        everybody else. Predators control public space, parks are death traps,
        aggressive menace is celebrated as ‘attitude’, property acquisition is
        for mugs (or muggers), educational aspiration is ridiculed, and
        non-criminal business activity is despised as a violation of cultural
        norms. Every significant mechanism of socio-cultural pressure, from
        interpreted heritage and peer influences to political rhetoric and
        economic incentives, is aligned to the deepening of complacent depravity
        and the ruthless extirpation of every impulse to self-improvement. Quite
        clearly, these are places where civilization has fundamentally
        collapsed, and a society that includes them has to some substantial
        extent <em>failed</em>.

        Within the most influential countries of the English-speaking world, the
        disintegration of urban civilization has profoundly shaped the structure
        and development of cities. In many cases, the ‘natural’ (one might now
        say ‘Asian’) pattern, in which intensive urbanization and corresponding
        real estate values are greatest in the downtown core, has been
        shattered, or at least deeply deformed. Social disintegration of the
        urban center has driven an exodus of the (even moderately) prosperous to
        suburban and exurban refuges, producing a grotesque and historically
        unprecedented pattern of ‘donut’-style development, with cities
        tolerating – or merely accommodating themselves to – ruined and rotting
        interiors, where sane people fear to tread. ‘Inner city’ has come to
        mean almost exactly the opposite of what an undistorted course of urban
        development would produce. This is the geographical expression of a
        Western – and especially American – social problem that is at once
        basically unmentionable and visible from outer space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, the core-crashed donut syndrome has a notably insensitive
        yet commonly accepted name, which captures it in broad outlines – at
        least according to its secondary characteristics – and to a reasonable
        degree of statistical approximation: <em>White Flight</em>. This is an
        arresting term, for a variety of reasons. It is stamped, first of all,
        by the racial bi-polarity that – as a <em>vital archaism</em> –
        resonates with America’s chronic social crisis at a number of levels.
        Whilst superficially outdated in an age of many-hued multicultural and
        immigration issues, it reverts to the undead code inherited from slavery
        and segregation, perpetually identified with Faulkner’s words: “The past
        is not dead. It isn’t even past.” Yet even in this untypical moment of
        racial candor, blackness is elided, and implicitly disconnected from
        agency. It is denoted only by allusion, as a residue, concentrated
        passively and derivatively by the sifting function of a
        highly-adrenalized white panic. What <em>cannot be said</em> is
        indicated even as it is unmentioned. A distinctive silence accompanies
        the broken, half-expression of a mute tide of racial separatism, driven
        by civilizationally disabling terrors and animosities, whose depths, and
        structures of reciprocity, remain unavowable.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the puritan exodus from Old to New World was to the foundation of
        Anglophone global modernity, white flight is to its fraying and
        dissolution. As with the pre-founding migration, what gives white flight
        ineluctable relevance here is its sub-political character:
        <em>all exit and no voice</em>. It is the subtle, non-argumentative,
        non-demanding ‘other’ of social democracy and its dreams – the
        spontaneous impulse of dark enlightenment, as it is initially glimpsed,
        at once disillusioning and implacable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core-crashed donut is not the only model of sick city syndrome (the
        shanty fringe phenomenon emphasized in Mike Davis’
        <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Slums-Mike-Davis/dp/1844670228" target="_blank">Planet of
            Slums</a></em>
        is very different). Nor is donut-disaster urbanism reducible to racial
        crisis, at least in its origins. Technological factors have played a
        crucial role (most prominently, automobile geography) as have quite
        other, long-standing cultural traditions (such as the construction of
        suburbia as a bourgeois idyll). Yet all such lineages have been in very
        large measure supplanted by, or at least subordinated to, the inherited,
        and still emerging, ‘race problem.’
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is this ‘problem’? How is it developing? Why should anybody
        outside America be concerned about it? Why raise the topic now (if
        ever)? – If your heart is sinking under the gloomy suspicion this is
        going to be huge, meandering, nerve-wracking, and torturous, you’re
        right. We’ve got <em>weeks</em> in this chamber of horrors to look
        forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two simplest, quite widely held, and basically incompatible answers
        to the first question deserve to be considered as important
        <em>parts</em> of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>Question: What is America’s race problem?</p>
      <p>Answer-1: Black people.</p>
      <p>Answer-2: White people.</p>
      <p>
        The combined popularity of these options is significantly expanded, most
        probably to encompass a large majority of all Americans, when is taken
        to include those who assume that one of these two answers dominates the
        thinking of <em>the other side</em>. Between them, the propositions “The
        problem would be over if we could just rid ourselves of black hoodlums /
        white racists” and / or “They think we’re all hoodlums / racists and
        want to get rid of us” consume an impressive proportion of the political
        spectrum, establishing a solid foundation of reciprocal terror and
        aversion. When defensive projections are added (“We’re not hoodlums,
        you’re racists” or “We’re not racists, you’re hoodlums”), the potential
        for super-heated, non-synthesizing dialectics approaches the infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not that these ‘sides’ are racial (except in black or white
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/why-i-am-not-white-nationalist.html"
          target="_blank">tribal-nationalist fantasy</a>). For crude stereotypes, it is far more useful to turn to the
        <em>principal political dimension</em>, and its categories of ‘liberal’
        and ‘conservative’ in the contemporary, American sense. To identify
        America’s race problem with white racism is the stereotypical
        <em>liberal</em> position, whilst identifying it with black social
        dysfunction is the exact <em>conservative</em> complement. Although
        these stances are formally symmetrical, it is their actual political
        <em>asymmentry</em> that charges the American race problem with its
        extraordinary historical dynamism and universal significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        That American whites and blacks – considered crudely as statistical
        aggregates — co-exist in a relation of reciprocal fear and perceived
        victimization, is attested by the manifest patterns of urban development
        and navigation, school choice, gun ownership, policing and
        incarceration, and just about every other expression of
        <em>revealed</em> (as opposed to <em>stated</em>) preference that is
        related to voluntary social distribution and security. An objective
        balance of terror reigns, erased from visibility by complementary yet
        incompatible perspectives of victimological supremacism and denial. Yet
        between <em>the</em>
        <em>liberal and conservative positions on race</em> there is no balance
        whatsoever, but something closer to a rout. Conservatives are utterly
        terrified of the issue, whilst for liberals it is a garden of earthly
        delight, whose pleasures transcend the limits of human understanding.
        When any political discussion firmly and clearly arrives at the topic of
        race, liberalism wins. That is the fundamental law of ideological
        effectiveness in the <del>shadow</del> fragrant shade of the Cathedral.
        In certain respects, this dynamic political imbalance is even the
        primary phenomenon under consideration (and much more needs to be said
        about it, down the road).
      </p>
      <p>
        The regular, excruciating, soul-crushing humiliation of conservatism on
        the race issue should come as no surprise to anybody. After all, the
        principal role of conservatism in modern politics is to be humiliated.
        That is what a perpetual loyal opposition, or court jester, is for. The
        essential character of liberalism, as guardian and proponent of
        neo-puritan spiritual truth, invests it with supreme mastery over the
        dialectic, or invulnerability to contradiction.
        <em>That which it is impossible to think must necessarily be embraced,
          through faith</em>. Consider only the fundamental doctrine or first article of the
        liberal creed, as promulgated through every public discussion, academic
        articulation, and legislative initiative relevant to the topic:
        <em>Race doesn’t exist, except as a social construct employed by one race
          to exploit and oppress another</em>. Merely to entertain it is to shudder before the awesome majesty of
        the absolute, where everything is simultaneously its precise opposite,
        and reason evaporates ecstatically at the brink of the sublime.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the world was built out of ideology, this story would already be
        over, or at least predictably programmed. Beyond the apparent zig-zag of
        the dialectic there is a dominant trend, heading in a single,
        unambiguous direction. Yet the liberal-progressive solution to the race
        problem – open-endedly escalating, comprehensively systematic,
        dynamically paradoxical ‘anti-racism’ – confronts a real obstacle that
        is only very partially reflected in conservative attitudes, rhetoric,
        and ideology. The real enemy, glacial, inchoate, and non-argumentative,
        is ‘white flight’.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, explicit reference to the Derbyshire Case becomes
        irresistible. There is a very considerable amount of complex, recent
        historical context that cries out for introduction – the cultural
        convulsion attending the Trayvon Martin incident in particular – but
        there’ll be time for that later (oh yes, I’m afraid so). Derbyshire’s
        intervention, and the explosion of words it provoked, while to some
        extent illuminated by such context, far exceeds it. That is because the
        crucial unspoken term, both in Derbyshire’s now-notorious
        <a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire" target="_blank">short
          article</a>,
        and also — apparently — in the responses it generated, is ‘white
        flight’. By publishing paternal advice to his (Eurasian) children that
        has been — not entirely unreasonably — summarized as ‘avoid black
        people’, he converted white flight from a much-lamented but seemingly
        inexorable fact into an explicit imperative, even a <em>cause</em>.
        <em>Don’t argue, flee</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word Derbyshire emphasizes, in his own penumbra of commentary, and
        in antecedent writings, is not ‘flight’ or ‘panic’, but
        <em>despair</em>. When asked by blogger Vox Day whether he agreed that
        the ‘race card’ had become less intimidating over the past two decades,
        Derbyshire

        <p>
          <em>One </em>[factor]<em>, which I’ve written about more than once, I think, in the United
            States, is just despair. I am of a certain age, and I was around 50
            years ago. I was reading the newspapers and following world events
            and I remember the civil rights movement. I was in England, but we
            followed it. I remember it, I remember what we felt about it, and
            what people were writing about it. It was full of hope. The idea in
            everyone’s mind was that if we strike down these unjust laws and we
            outlaw all this discrimination, then we’ll be whole. Then America
            will be made whole. After an intermediate period of a few years, who
            knows, maybe 20 years, with a hand up from things like affirmative
            action, black America will just merge into the general population
            and the whole thing will just go away. That’s what everybody
            believed. Everybody thought that. And it didn’t happen.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Here we are, we’re 50 years later, and we’ve still got these
            tremendous disparities in crime rates, educational attainment, and
            so on. And I think, although they’re still mouthing the platitudes,
            Americans in their hearts feel a kind of cold despair about it. They
            feel that Thomas Jefferson was probably right and we can’t live
            together in harmony. I think that’s why you see this slow ethnic
            disaggregation. We have a very segregated school system now. There
            are schools within 10 miles of where I’m sitting that are 98 percent
            minority. In residential housing too, it’s the same thing. So I
            think there is a cold, dark despair lurking in America’s collective
            heart about the whole thing.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a version of reality that few want to hear. As Derbyshire
        recognizes, Americans are a predominantly Christian, optimistic,
        ‘can-do’ people, whose ‘collective heart’ is unusually maladapted to an
        <em>abandonment of hope</em>. This is a country culturally hard-wired to
        interpret despair not merely as error or weakness, but as <em>sin</em>.
        Nobody who understands this could be remotely surprised to find bleak
        hereditarian fatalism being rejected — typically with vehement hostility
        — not only by progressives, but also by the overwhelming majority of
        conservatives. At NRO, Andrew C. McCarthy no doubt spoke for many in

        <p>
          <em>There is a world of difference, though, between the need to be able
            to discuss uncomfortable facts about IQ and incarceration, on the
            one hand, and, on the other, to urge race as a rationale for
            abandoning basic Christian charity.</em>

        Others went much further. At the Examiner, James Gibson

          target="_blank">seized</a>
        upon “John Derbyshire’s vile racist screed” as the opportunity to teach
        a wider lesson – “the danger of conservatism divorced from
        Christianity”:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… since Derbyshire does not believe “that Jesus of Nazareth was
            divine . . . and that the Resurrection was a real event,”; he cannot
            comprehend the great mystery of the Incarnation, whereby the Divine
            truly did take on human flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth and
            suffered death at the hands of a fallen humanity in order to redeem
            that humanity out of its state of fallenness.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Herein lies the danger of a conservative socio-political philosophy
            divorced from a robust Christian faith. It becomes a dead ideology
            spawning a view of humanity that is toxic, fatalistic, and (as
            Derbyshire proves abundantly) uncharitable.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It was, of course, on the left that the fireworks truly ignited. Elspeth
        Reeve at the Atlantic Wire
        <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/04/why-john-derbyshire-hasnt-been-fired-yet/50803/"
          target="_blank">contended</a>
        that Derbyshire had clung on to his relation with the National Review
        because he was offering the magazine’s “less enlightened readers” what
        they wanted: “dated racial stereotypes.” Like Gibson on the right, she
        was keen for people to learn a wider lesson:
        <em>don’t think for a minute this stops with Derbyshire</em>. (The
        stunningly uncooperative comments thread to her article is worth
        noting.)
      </p>
      <p>
        At Gawker, Louis Peitzman
        <a href="http://gawker.com/5900109/racist-john-derbyshire-fired-for-writing-most-racist-article-possible"
          target="_blank">jumped the shark</a>
        (in the approved direction) by describing Derbyshire’s “horrifying
        diatribe” as the “most racist article possible,” a judgment that betrays
        extreme historical ignorance, a sheltered life, unusual innocence, and a
        lack of imagination, as well as making the piece sound far more
        interesting than it actually is. Peitzman’s commentators are impeccably
        liberal, and of course uniformly, utterly, shatteringly appalled (to the
        point of orgasm). Beyond the emoting, Peitzman doesn’t offer much
        content, excepting only a little extra emoting – this time mild
        satisfaction mixed with residual rage – at the news that Derbyshire’s
        punishment has at least begun (“a step in the right direction”) with his
        “canning” from the <em>National Review</em>.

        at something called the Good Feed Blog) sought to extend the purge
        beyond Derbyshire, to include anybody who had not yet erupted into
        sufficiently melodramatic paroxysms of indignation, starting with David
        Weigel
        <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/04/06/john_derbyshire_s_advice_for_white_people.html"
          target="_blank">at</a>
        Slate (who she doesn’t know “in real life, but in reading this piece, it
        seems you just might be a racist, pal”). “There are so many … racist,
        dehumanizing references to black people in Derbyshire’s article that I
        have to just stop myself here before I recount the entire thing point by
        point with fuming rage,” she shares. Unlike Peitzman, however, at least
        Schroeder has a point – the racial terror dialectic — “… propagating the
        idea that we should be afraid of black men, of black people in general,
        makes this world dangerous for innocent Americans.”

        “In brief, dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of
        opposites. This embodies the essence of dialectics,” Lenin
        <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/summary.htm" target="_blank">notes</a>,
        “but
        it requires explanations and development.” That is to say:
        further discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sublimation (<em>Aufhebung</em>) of Marxism into Leninism is an
        eventuality that is best grasped crudely. By forging a revolutionary
        communist politics of broad application, almost entirely divorced from
        the mature material conditions or advanced social contradictions that
        had been previously anticipated, Lenin demonstrated that dialectical
        tension coincided, exhaustively, with its politicization (and that all
        reference to a ‘dialectics of nature’ is no more than retrospective
        subordination of the scientific domain to a political model). Dialectics
        are as real as they are made to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dialectic begins with political agitation, and extends no further
        than its practical, antagonistic, factional and coalitional ‘logic’. It
        is the ‘superstructure’ <em>for itself</em>, or against natural
        limitation, practically appropriating the political sphere in its
        broadest graspable extension as a platform for social domination.
        Everywhere that there is argument, there is an unresolved opportunity to
        rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cathedral incarnates these lessons. It has no need to espouse
        Leninism, or operational communist dialectics, because it recognizes
        nothing else. There is scarcely a fragment of the social
        ‘superstructure’ that has escaped dialectical reconstruction, through
        articulate antagonism, polarization, binary structuring, and reversal.
        Within the academy, the media, even the fine arts, political
        super-saturation has prevailed, identifying even the most minuscule
        elements of apprehension with conflictual ‘social critique’ and
        egalitarian teleology. Communism is the universal implication.
      </p>
      <p>
        More dialectics is more politics, and more politics means ‘progress’ –
        or social migration to the left. The production of public agreement only
        leads in one direction, and within public disagreement, such impetus
        already exists in embryo. It is only in the absence of agreement
        <em>and</em> of publicly articulated disagreement, which is to say, in
        non-dialectics, non-argument, sub-political diversity, or politically
        uncoordinated initiative, that the ‘right-wing’ refuge of ‘the economy’
        (and civil society more widely) is to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        When no agreement is necessary, or coercively demanded, negative (or
        ‘libertarian’) liberty is still possible, and this non-argumentative
        ‘other’ of dialectics is easily formulated (even if, in a free society,
        it doesn’t need to be): <em>Do your own thing</em>. Quite clearly, this
        irresponsible and negligent imperative is
        <em>politically</em> intolerable. It coincides exactly with leftist
        depression, retrogression, or depoliticization. Nothing cries out more
        urgently to be <em>argued against</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the opposite extreme lies the dialectical ecstasy of theatrical
        justice, in which the argumentative structure of legal proceedings is
        coupled with publicization through the media. Dialectical enthusiasm
        finds its definitive expression in a courtroom drama that combines
        lawyers, journalists, community activists, and other agents of the
        revolutionary superstructure in the production of a <em>show trial</em>.
        Social contradictions are staged, antagonistic cases articulated, and
        resolution institutionally expected. This is Hegel for prime-time
        television (and now for the Internet). It is the way that the Cathedral
        shares its message with the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, in its impatient passion for progress, this message can trip
        over itself, because even though the agents of the Cathedral are
        <em>infinitely</em> reasonable, they are ever less sensible, often
        strikingly incompetent, and prone to making mistakes. This is to be
        expected on theological grounds. As the state becomes God, it
        degenerates into imbecility, on the model of the holy fool. The
        media-politics of the Trayvon Martin spectacle provides a pertinent
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, as in any other large country, lots of things
        happen every day, exhibiting innumerable patterns of varying obscurity.
        For
        <a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" target="_blank">instance</a>, on an average day, there
        are roughly 3,400 violent crimes, including
        40 murders, 230 rapes, 1,000 robberies, and 2,100 aggravated assaults,
        alongside 25,000 non-violent property crimes (burglaries and thefts).
        Very few of these will be widely publicized, or seized upon as
        educational, exemplary, and representative. Even were the media not
        inclined towards a narrative-based selection of ‘good stories’, the
        sheer volume of incidents would compel something of the kind. Given this
        situation, it is all but inevitable that people will ask:
        <em>Why are they telling us this?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost everything about the death of Trayvon Martin is controversial,
        except for media motivation. On that topic there is near unanimity. The
        meaning or intended message of the story of the case could scarcely have
        been more transparent:
        <em>White racist paranoia makes America dangerous for black people</em>.
        It would thus rehearse the dialectic of racial terror (<em>your fear is scary</em>), designed – as always — to
        convert America’s reciprocal social
        nightmare into a unilateral morality play, allocating legitimate dread
        exclusively to one side of the country’s principal racial divide. It
        seemed perfect. A malignantly deluded white vigilante guns down an
        innocent black child, justifying black fear (‘the talk’) whilst exposing
        white panic as a murderous psychosis. This is a story of such archetypal
        progressive meaning that it cannot be told too many times. In fact, it
        was just too good to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        It soon became evident, however, that media selection – even when
        reinforced by the celebrity / ‘community activist’ rage-machine – hadn’t
        sufficed to keep the story on script, and both of the main actors were
        drifting from their assigned roles. If progressively-endorsed
        stereotypes were to be even remotely preserved, vigorous
        <a href="http://destructure.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/trayvon-martin-faq/" target="_blank">editing</a>
        would be required. This was especially necessary because certain evil,
        racist, bigoted readers of the
        <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/26/v-fullstory/2714778/thousands-expected-at-trayvon.html"
          target="_blank">Miami Herald</a>
        were beginning to forge a narrative-wrecking mental connection between
        ‘Trayvon Martin’ and ‘burglary tool’.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the killer, George Zimmerman, the name said it all. He was
        clearly going to be a hulking, pasty-faced, storm-trooper look-alike,
        hopefully some kind of Christian gun-nut, and maybe – if they really hit
        pay-dirt – a militia movement type with a history of homophobia and
        anti-abortion activism. He started off ‘white’ – for no obvious reason
        beyond media incompetence and narrative programming – then found himself
        transformed into a ‘white Hispanic’ (a category that seems to have been
        rapidly innovated on the spot), before gradually shifted through a
        series of ever more reality-compliant ethnic complications, culminating
        in the discovery of his Afro-Peruvian great grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the heart of the Cathedral it was well into head-scratching time.
        Here was the great Amerikkkan defendant being prepped for his show
        trial, the President had pitched in emotionally on behalf of the sacred
        victim, and the coordinated ground game had been advanced to the
        simmering brink of race riots, when the message began falling apart, to
        such an extent that it now threatened to decay into an annoyingly
        irrelevant case of black-on-black violence. It was not only that George
        Zimmerman had black ancestry – making him simply ‘black’ by the left’s
        own social constructivist standards – he had also grown up amicably
        among black people, with two African-American girls as “part of the
        household for years,” had entered into joint business venture with a
        black partner, he was a registered Democrat, and even some kind of
        ‘community organizer’ …
      </p>
      <p>
        So why did Martin die? Was it for carrying iced tea and a bag of
        Skittles while black (the media and community activist approved, ‘son
        Obama might have had’ version), for scoping out burglary targets (the
        Kluxer racial profiling version), or for breaking Zimmerman’s nose,
        knocking him over, sitting on top of him, and smashing his head
        repeatedly against the sidewalk (to be decided in court)? Was he a
        martyr to racial injustice, a low-level social predator, or a human
        symptom of American urban crisis? The only thing that was really clear
        when legal proceedings began, beyond the squalid sadness of the episode,
        was that it was not resolving anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a sense of just how disconcertingly the approved lesson had
        disintegrated by the time Zimmerman was charged with second degree
        murder, it is only necessary to read
        <a href="http://onestdv.blogspot.com/2012/04/american-masses-and-why-i-stand-with.html" target="_blank">this
          post</a>
        by HBD-blogger oneSTDV, describing the dialectical derangements of the
        race-warrior right:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Despite the disturbing nature of the “charges” against Zimmerman,
            many in the alt-right refuse to grant Zimmerman any sympathy or to
            even view this as a seminal moment in modern leftism’s
            anarcho-tyrannical reign. According to these individuals,
            <strong>the Spanish-speaking, registered Democrat mestizo got what was
              coming to him</strong>
            — the ire of the black mob and the elite left indirectly buttressed
            by Zimmerman himself. Due to his voting record, multicultural
            background, and mentoring of minority youth, they see Zimmerman as
            emblematic of the left’s assault on white America, a sort of ground
            soldier in the campaign against American whiteness. </em>[Bolding in original]
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The pop PC police were ready to move on. With the great show trial
        collapsing into narrative disorder, it was time to refocus on the
        Message, facts be damned (and double damned). ‘<a
          href="http://jezebel.com/5905291/a-complete-guide-to-hipster-racism" target="_blank">Jezebel</a>’ best
        exemplifies the hectoring, vaguely hysterical tone:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>You know how you can tell that black people are still oppressed?
            Because </em>black people are still oppressed<em>. If you claim that you are not a racist person (or, at
            least, that
            you’re committed to working your ass off not to be one — which is
            really the best that any of us can promise), then you must believe
            that people are fundamentally born equal. So if that’s true, then in
            a vacuum, factors like skin color should have no effect on anyone’s
            success. Right? And therefore, if you really believe that all people
            are created equal, then when you see that drastic racial
            inequalities exist in the real world, the only thing that you could </em>possibly<em>
            conclude is that some external force is holding certain people back.
            Like…racism. Right? So congratulations! You believe in racism!
            Unless you don’t actually think that people are born equal. And if
            you don’t believe that people are born equal, </em>then you’re a f*****g racist<em>.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Does anyone “really believe that people are born equal,” in the way it
        is understood here? Believe, that is, not only that a formal expectation
        of equal treatment is a prerequisite for civilized interaction, but that
        any revealed deviation from substantial equality of outcome is an
        obvious, unambiguous indication of oppression? That’s “the only thing
        you could <em>possibly</em> conclude”?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the very least, Jezebel should be congratulated for expressing the
        progressive faith in its purest form, entirely uncontaminated by
        sensitivity to evidence or uncertainty of any kind, casually
        contemptuous of any relevant research – whether existent or merely
        conceivable – and supremely confident about its own moral invincibility.
        If the facts are <em>morally wrong</em>, so much worse for the facts –
        that’s the only position that could <em>possibly</em> be adopted, even
        if it’s based upon a mixture of wishful thinking, deliberate ignorance,
        and insultingly childish lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To call the belief in substantial human equality a superstition is to
        insult superstition. It might be unwarranted to believe in leprechauns,
        but at least the person who holds to such a belief isn’t
        <em>watching them not exist</em>, for every waking hour of the day.
        Human inequality, in contrast, and in all of its abundant multiplicity,
        is constantly on display, as people exhibit their variations in gender,
        ethnicity, physical attractiveness, size and shape, strength, health,
        agility, charm, humor, wit, industriousness, and sociability, among
        countless other features, traits, abilities, and aspects of their
        personality, some immediately and conspicuously, some only slowly, over
        time. To absorb even the slightest fraction of all this and to conclude,
        in the <em>only way possible</em>, that it is either nothing at all, or
        a ‘social construct’ and index of oppression, is sheer Gnostic delirium:
        a commitment beyond all evidence to the existence of a true and good
        world veiled by appearances. People are not equal, they do not develop
        equally, their goals and achievements are not equal, and nothing can
        make them equal. Substantial equality has no relation to reality, except
        as its systematic negation. Violence on a genocidal scale is required to
        even approximate to a practical egalitarian program, and if anything
        less ambitious is attempted, people get around it (some more competently
        than others).
      </p>
      <p>
        To take only the most obvious example, anybody with more than one child
        knows that <em>nobody is born equal</em> (monozygotic twins and clones
        perhaps excepted). <em>In fact</em>, everybody is born different, in
        innumerable ways. Even when – as is normally the case – the implications
        of these differences for life outcomes are difficult to confidently
        predict, their existence is undeniable, or at least:
        <em>sincerely undeniable</em>. Of course sincerity, or even minimal
        cognitive coherence, is not remotely the issue here. Jezebel’s position,
        whilst impeccable in its political correctness, is not only factually
        dubious, but rather laughably absurd, and actually – strictly speaking —
        insane. It dogmatizes a denial of reality so extreme that nobody could
        genuinely maintain, or even entertain it, let alone plausible explain or
        defend it. It is a tenet of faith that cannot be understood, but only
        asserted, or submitted to, as madness made law, or authoritarian
        religion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The political commandment of this religion is transparent: Accept
        progressive social policy as the <em>only possible</em> solution to the
        <del>sin</del> problem of inequality. This commandment is a ‘categorical
        imperative’ – no possible fact could ever undermine, complicate, or
        revise it. If progressive social policy actually results in an
        exacerbation of the problem, ‘fallen’ reality is to blame, since the
        social malady is <em>obviously</em> worse than had been originally
        envisaged, and only redoubled efforts in the same direction can hope to
        remedy it. There can be nothing to learn in matters of faith.
        Eventually, systematic social collapse teaches the lesson that chronic
        failure and incremental deterioration could not communicate. (That’s
        macro-scale social Darwinism for dummies, and it’s the way that
        civilizations end.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to it’s exceptional correlation with substantial variation in social
        outcomes in modern societies, by far the most troublesome dimension of
        human bio-diversity is intelligence or general problem solving ability,
        quantified as IQ (measuring Spearman’s ‘g’). When ‘statistical common
        sense’ or profiling is applied to the proponents of Human Bio-Diversity,
        however, another significant trait is rapidly exposed: a remarkably
        consistent deficit of <em>agreeableness</em>. Indeed, it is widely
        accepted within the accursed ‘community’ itself that most of those
        stubborn and awkward enough to educate themselves on the topic of human
        biological variation are significantly ‘<a
          href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/one-baby-alone-on-a-pca-island/#more-16427"
          target="_blank">socially retarded</a>’, with low verbal inhibition, low empathy, and low social integration,
        resulting in chronic maladaptation to group expectations. The typical
        EQs of this group can be extracted as the approximate square-root of
        their IQs. Mild autism is typical, sufficient to approach their fellow
        beings in a spirit of detached, natural-scientific curiosity, but not so
        advanced as to compel total cosmic disengagement. These traits, which
        they themselves consider – on the basis of copious technical information
        — to be substantially heritable, have manifest social consequences,
        reducing employment opportunities, incomes, and even reproductive
        potential. Despite all the free therapeutic advice available in the
        progressive environment, this obnoxiousness shows no sign of
        diminishing, and might even be intensifying. As Jezebel shows so
        clearly, this can only <em>possibly</em> be a sign of structural
        oppression. Why can’t obnoxious people get a break?
      </p>
      <p>
        The history is damning. ‘Sociables’ have always had it in for the
        obnoxious, often declining to marry or do business with them, excluding
        them from group activities and political office, labeling them with
        slurs, ostracizing and avoiding them. ‘Obnoxiousness’ has been
        stigmatized and stereotyped in extremely negative terms, to such an
        extent that many of the obnoxious have sought out more sensitive labels,
        such as ‘socially-challenged’, or ‘differently socially abled’. Not
        uncommonly, people have been verbally or even physically assaulted for
        no other reason than their radical obnoxiousness. Most tragically of
        all, due to their complete inability to get on with one another, the
        obnoxious have never been able to politically mobilize against the
        structural social oppression they face, or to enter into coalitions with
        their natural allies, such as cynics, debunkers, contrarians, and
        Tourette Syndrome sufferers. Obnoxiousness has yet to be liberated,
        although it’s probable that the Internet will ‘help’ …

        Consider John Derbyshire’s essay in infamy
        <em><a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/print" target="_blank">The
            Talk:
            Nonblack Version</a></em>, focusing initially on its relentless obnoxiousness, and attentive to
        the negative correlation between sociability and objective reason. As
        Derbyshire notes elsewhere, people are generally incapable of
        differentiating themselves from group identities, or properly applying
        statistical generalizations about groups to individual cases, including
        their own. A rationally indefensible, but socially inevitable,
        reification of group profiles is psychologically normal – even ‘human’ –
        with the result that noisy, non-specific, statistical information is
        erroneously accepted as a contribution to self-understanding, even when
        specific information is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of socially autistic, low-EQ, rational analysis,
        this is simply <em>mistaken</em>. If an individual has certain
        characteristics, the fact of belonging to a group that has similar or
        dissimilar average characteristics is of no relevance whatsoever. Direct
        and determinate information about the individual is not to any degree
        enriched by indirect and indeterminate (probabilistic) information about
        the groups to which the individual belongs. If an individual’s test
        results are known, for instance, no additional insight is provided by
        statistical inferences about the test results that
        <em>might have been expected</em> based on group profiling. An Ashkenazi
        Jewish moron is no less moronic because he is an Ashkenazi Jew. Elderly
        Chinese nuns are unlikely to be murderers, but a murderer who happens to
        be an elderly Chinese nun is neither more nor less murderous than one
        who is not. This is all extremely obvious, to obnoxious people.
      </p>
      <p>
        To normal people, however, it is not obvious at all. In part this is
        because rational intelligence is scarce and abnormal among humans, and
        in part because social ‘intelligence’ works with what everyone else is
        thinking, which is to say, with irrational groupish sentiment, meager
        information, prejudices, stereotypes, and heuristics. Since (almost)
        everybody else is taking short-cuts, or ‘economizing’ on reason, it is
        only rational to react defensively to generalizations that are likely to
        be reified or inappropriately applied — over-riding or substituting for
        specific perceptions. Anybody who anticipates being pre-defined through
        a group identity has an expanded ego-investment in that group and the
        way it is perceived. A generic assessment, however objectively arrived
        at, will immediately become personal, under (even quite remotely) normal
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obnoxious reason can stubbornly insist that
        <em>anything average cannot be about you</em>, but the message will not
        be generally received. Human social ‘intelligence’ is not built that
        way. Even supposedly sophisticated commentators blunder repeatedly into
        the most jarring exhibitions of basic statistical incomprehension
        without the slightest embarrassment, because embarrassment was designed
        for something else (and for almost exactly the opposite). The failure to
        understand stereotypes in their scientific, or probabilistic
        application, is a functional prerequisite of sociability, since the sole
        alternative to idiocy in this respect is obnoxiousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derbyshire’s article is noteworthy because it succeeds in being
        <em>definitively obnoxious</em>, and has been recognized as such,
        despite the spluttering incoherence of most rejoinders. Among the things
        that ‘the talk’ and ‘the counter-talk’ share is a theatrical structure
        of <em>pseudo-private conversation designed to be overheard</em>. In
        both cases, a message that parents are compelled to deliver to their
        children is staged as the vehicle for a wider social lesson, aimed at
        those who, through action or inaction, have created a world that is
        intolerably hazardous to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This form is intrinsically manipulative, making even the ‘original’ talk
        a tempting target of parody. In the original, however, a tone of
        anguished sincerity is engineered through a deliberate performance of
        innocence (or ignorance).
        <em>Listen son, I know this will be difficult to understand …</em> (<em>Oh why, oh why are they doing this to
          us?</em>). The counter-talk, in stark contrast, melds its micro-social drama
        with the clinically non-sociable discourse of “methodical inquiries in
        the human sciences” – treating populations as fuzzy bio-geographical
        units with quantifiable characteristics, rather than as legal-political
        subjects in communication. It derides innocence, and – by implication –
        the criterion of sociability itself. Agreement, agreeableness, count for
        nothing. The rigorously and redundantly compiled statistics say what
        they say, and if we cannot live with that, so much the worse for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet even to a reasonably sympathetic, or scrupulously obnoxious,
        reading, Derbyshire’s article provides grounds for criticism. For
        instance, and from the beginning, it is notable that the racial
        reciprocal of “nonblack Americans” is ‘black Americans’, not “American
        blacks” (the term Derbyshire selects). This reversal of word order,
        switching nouns and adjectives, quickly settles into a pattern. Does it
        matter that Derbyshire requests the extension of civility to any
        “individual black” (rather than to ‘black individuals’)? It certainly
        makes a difference. To say that someone is ‘black’ is to say something
        <em>about</em> them, but to say that someone is ‘a black’ is to say who
        they <em>are</em>. The effect is subtly, yet distinctly, menacing, and
        Derbyshire is too well-trained, algebraically, to be excused from
        noticing it. After all, ‘John Derbyshire is <em>a white</em>’ sounds
        equally <em>off</em>, as does any analogous formulation, submerging the
        individual in the genus, to be retrieved as a mere instance, or example.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more intellectually substantive aspect of this over-reach into
        gratuitous incivility have been examined by
        <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/human_nature/2012/04/john_derbyshire_trayvon_martin_and_the_ignorance_of_racial_profiling_.html"

          target="_blank">Noah Millman</a>, who make very similar points, from the two sides of the
        liberal/conservative divide. Both writers identify a fissure or
        methodical incongruity in Derbyshire’s article, stemming from its
        commitment to the micro-social application of macro-social statistical
        generalizations. Stereotypes, however rigorously confirmed, are
        <em>essentially</em> inferior to specific knowledge in any concrete
        social situation, because nobody ever encounters a population.

        As a liberal of
        <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/features/2007/created_equal/liberalcreationism.html"
          target="_blank">problematic standing</a>, Saletan has no choice but to recoil melodramatically from
        Derbyshire’s “stomach-turning conclusions,” but his reasons for doing so
        are not consumed by his gastro-emotional crisis. “But what exactly is a
        statistical truth?” he asks. “It’s a probability estimate you might fall
        back on if you know nothing about [a particular individual]. It’s an
        ignorant person’s weak substitute for knowledge.” Derbyshire, with his
        Aspergery attention to the absence of black Fields Medal winners, is “…a
        math nerd who substitutes statistical intelligence for social
        intelligence. He recommends group calculations instead of taking the
        trouble to learn about the person standing in front of you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Millman emphasizes the ironic reversal that switches (obnoxious) social
        scientific knowledge into imperative ignorance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The “race realists” like to say that they are the ones who are
            curious about the world, and the “politically correct” types are the
            ones who prefer to ignore ugly reality. But the advice Derbyshire
            gives to his children encourages them </em>not<em>
            to be too curious about the world around them, for fear of getting
            hurt. And, as a general rule, that’s terrible advice for kids – and
            not the advice that Derbyshire has followed in his own life.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Millman’s conclusion is also instructive:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>So why am I arguing with Derb at all? Well, because he’s a friend.
            And because even lazy, socially-irresponsible talk deserves to be
            refuted, not merely denounced. Is Derbyshire’s piece racist? </em>Of course it’s racist.<em>
            His whole point is that it is both rational and morally right for
            his children to treat black people significantly differently from
            white people, and to fear them. But “racist” is a descriptive term,
            not a moral one. The “race realist” crowd is strongly convinced of
            the accuracy of Derbyshire’s major premises, and they are not going
            to be argued out of that conviction by the assertion such conviction
            is “racist” – nor, honestly, should they be. For that reason, I feel
            it’s important to argue that Derbyshire’s conclusions do not follow
            simply from those premises, and are, in fact, morally incorrect even
            if those premises are granted for the sake of argument.</em>

            Always has been, always will be. I have attended at least a hundred
            conservative gatherings, conferences, cruises, and jamborees: let me
            tell you, there ain’t too many raisins in that bun. I was in and out
            of the National Review offices for twelve years, and the only black
            person I saw there, other than when Herman Cain came calling, was
            Alex, the guy who runs the mail room. (Hey, Alex!)<br />
            This isn’t because conservatism is hostile to blacks and mestizos.
            Very much the contrary, especially in the case of Conservatism Inc.
            They fawn over the occasional nonwhite with a puppyish deference
            that fairly fogs the air with embarrassment. (Q: What do you call

            It’s just that conservative ideals like self-sufficiency and minimal

        America’s racial ‘original sin’ was foundational, dating back before the
        birth of the United States to the clearing of aboriginal peoples by
        European settlers, and – still more saliently – to the institution of
        chattel slavery. This is the Old Testament history of American
        black-white relations, set down in a providential narrative of escape
        from bondage, in which factual documentation and moral exhortation are
        indissolubly fused. The combination of prolonged and intense social
        abuse in a pattern set by the Torah, recapitulating the primordial
        moral-political myth of the Western tradition, has installed the story
        of slavery and emancipation as the unsurpassable frame of the American
        historical experience: <em>let my people go</em>.

        ‘Practically Historical’ (cited above), quotes Lincoln on the Civil War:

      <blockquote>
        <p>

            the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall
            be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be
            paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand
            years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord are
            true and righteous altogether.”</em>

      <p>
        The New Testament of race in America was written in the 1960s, revising
        and specifying the template. The combination of the Civil Rights
        Movement, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Republican
        Southern Strategy (appealing to disaffected whites in the states of the
        old Confederacy) forged a partisan identification between Blacks and the
        Democratic Party that amounted to a liberal-progressive rebirth, setting
        the terms for partisan racial polarization that have endured – and even
        strengthened – over subsequent decades. For a progressive movement
        compromised by a history of systematic eugenicist racism, and a
        Democratic Party traditionally aligned with white southern obduracy and
        the Ku Klux Klan, the civil rights era presented an opportunity for
        atonement, ritual purification, and redemption.<br />
        Reciprocally, for American conservatism (and its increasingly
        directionless Republican Party vehicle), this progression spelt
        protracted death, for reasons that continue to elude it. The Idea of
        America was now inextricable from a vehement renunciation of the past,
        and even of the present, insofar as the past still shaped it. Only an
        ‘ever more perfect union’ could conform to it. At the most superficial
        level, the broad partisan implications of the new order were
        unmistakable in a country that was becoming ever more democratic, and
        ever less republican, with effective sovereignty nationally concentrated
        in the executive, and the moral urgency of activist government installed
        as a principle of faith. For what had already become the ‘Old Right’
        there was no way out, or back, because the path backwards crossed the
        event horizon of the civil rights movement, into tracts of political
        impossibility whose ultimate meaning was slavery.

        The left thrives on dialectics, the right perishes through them. Insofar
        as there is a pure logic of politics, it is that. One immediate
        consequence (repeatedly emphasized by Mencius Moldbug) is that
        progressivism has no enemies to the left. It recognizes only idealists,
        whose time has not yet come. Factional conflicts on the left are
        politically dynamic, celebrated for their motive potential.
        Conservatism, in contrast, is caught between a rock and a hard place:
        bludgeoned from the left by the juggernaut of post-constitutional
        statism, and agitated from ‘the right’ by inchoate tendencies which are
        both unassimilable (to the mainstream) and often mutually incompatible,
        ranging from extreme (Austro-libertarian) varieties of
        <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalist advocacy to strains of obstinate,
        theologically-grounded social traditionalism, ultra-nationalism, or
        white identity politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘The right’ has no unity, actual or prospective, and thus has no
        definition symmetrical to that of the left. It is for this reason that
        political dialectics (a tautology) ratchets only in one direction,
        predictably, towards state expansion and an increasingly coercive
        substantial-egalitarian ideal. The right moves to the center, and the
        center moves to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of mainstream conservative fantasies, liberal-progressive
        mastery of American providence has become uncontestable, dominated by a
        racial dialectic that absorbs unlimited contradiction, whilst
        positioning the Afro-American underclass as the incarnate critique of
        the existing social order, the criterion of emancipation, and the sole
        path to collective salvation. No alternative structure of historical
        intelligibility is politically tolerable, or even – strictly speaking –
        imaginable, since resistance to the narrative is un-American,
        anti-social, and (of course) racist, serving only to confirm the
        existence of systematic racial oppression through the symbolic violence
        manifested in its negation. To argue against it is already to prove it
        correct, by concretely demonstrating the same benighted forces of social
        retardation that are being verbally denied. By resisting the demand for
        orchestrated social re-education, knuckle-dragging ‘bitter clingers’
        only show how much there still is to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its most abstract and all-encompassing, the liberal-progressive
        racial dialectic abolishes its outside, along with any possibility of
        principled consistency. It asserts — at one and the same time — that
        race does not exist, and that its socially-constructed pseudo-existence
        is an instrument of inter-racial violence. Racial recognition is both
        mandatory, and forbidden. Racial identities are meticulously catalogued
        for purposes of social remedy, hate crime detection, and disparate
        impact studies, targeting groups for ‘positive discrimination’,
        ‘affirmative action’, or ‘diversity promotion’ (to list these terms in
        their rough order of historical substitution), even as they are
        denounced as meaningless (by the United Nations, no less), and dismissed
        as malicious stereotypes, corresponding to nothing real. Extreme racial
        sensitivity and absolute racial desensitization are demanded
        simultaneously. Race is everything and nothing. There is no way out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conservatism is dialectically incompetent by definition, and so abjectly
        clueless that it imagines itself being able to exploit these
        contradictions, or – in its deluded

        – <em>liberal cognitive dissonance</em>. The conservatives who
        triumphantly point out such inconsistencies seem never to have skimmed
        the output of a contemporary humanities program, in which thick rafts of
        internally conflicted victimage are lovingly woven out of incompatible
        grievances, in order to exult in the radical progressive promise of
        their discordant lamentations. Inconsistency is fuel for the Cathedral,
        demanding activist argumentation, and ever heightened realizations of
        unity.
        <em>Integrative public debate always moves things to the left</em> —
        that might not seem an especially difficult point to grasp, but to
        understand it is to expose the fundamental futility of mainstream
        conservatism, and that is in almost nobody’s interest, so it will not be
        understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conservatism is incapable of working dialectics, or simultaneous
        contradiction, but that does not prevent it from serving progress (on
        the contrary). Rather than celebrating the power of inconsistency, it
        stumbles through contradictions, decompressed, in succession, in the
        manner of a fossil exhibition, and a foil. After “standing athwart
        history, yelling ‘Stop!’” during the Civil Rights Era, and thus
        banishing itself eternally to racial damnation, the conservative (and
        Republican) mainstream reversed course, seizing upon Martin Luther King
        Jr. as an integral part of its canon, and seeking to harmonize itself

      <p>
        Captivated by King’s appeal to constitutional and biblical
        traditionalism, by his rejection of political violence, and by his
        uninhibited paeans to freedom, American conservatism gradually came to
        identify with his dream of racial reconciliation and race blindness, and
        to accept it as the true, providential meaning of its own most sacred
        documents. At least, this became the mainstream, public, conservative
        orthodoxy, even though it was consolidated far too late to neutralize
        suspicions of insincerity, failed almost entirely to convince the black
        demographic itself, and would remain open to escalating derision from
        the left for its empty formalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        So compelling was King’s restatement of the American Creed that,
        retrospectively, its triumph over the political mainstream seems simply
        inevitable. The further American conservatism departed from the Masonic
        rationalism of the founders, in the direction of biblical religiosity,
        the more indistinguishable its faith became from a Black American
        experience, mythically articulated through <em>Exodus</em>, in which the
        basic framework of history was an escape from bondage, borne towards a
        future in which “all of God’s children — black men and white men, Jews
        and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics — will be able to join hands and
        sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: ‘Free at last! Free at
        last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!’”
      </p>
      <p>
        The genius of King’s message lay in its extraordinary power of
        integration. The flight of the Hebrews from Egypt, the American War of
        Independence, the abolition of chattel slavery in the wake of the
        American Civil War, and the aspirations of the civil rights era were
        mythically compressed into a single archetypal episode, perfectly
        consonant with the American Creed, and driven forwards not only by
        irresistible moral force, but even by divine decree. The measure of this
        integrative genius, however, is the complexity it masters. A century
        after the “joyous daybreak” of emancipation from slavery, King declares,
        “the Negro still is not free.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly
            crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of
            discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely
            island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material
            prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished
            in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his
            own land.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The story of <em>Exodus</em> is exit, the War of Independence is exit,
        and the emancipation from slavery is exit, especially when this is
        exemplified by the Underground Railroad and the model of
        self-liberation, escape, or flight. To be ‘manacled’ by segregation,
        ‘chained’ by discrimination, trapped on a ‘lonely island of poverty’, or
        ‘exiled’ in one’s ‘own land’, in contrast, has no relation to
        <em>exit</em> whatsoever, beyond that which spell-binding metaphor can
        achieve. There is no <em>exit</em> into social integration and
        acceptance, equitably distributed prosperity, public participation, or
        assimilation, but only an aspiration, or a dream, hostage to fact and
        fortune. As the left and the reactionary right were equally quick to
        notice, insofar as this dream ventures significantly beyond a right to
        formal equality and into the realm of substantial political remedy, it
        is one that the right has no right to.

        In the immediate wake of the John Derbyshire affair, Jessica Valenti at
        <em>The Nation</em> blog
        <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/167290/who-cares-about-john-derbyshire" target="_blank">makes</a>
        the point clearly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… this isn’t just about who has written what — it’s about the
            intensely racist policies that are par for the conservative course.
            Some people would like to believe that racism is just the explicit,
            said-out-loud discrimination and hatred that is easily identifiable.
            It’s not — it’s also pushing xenophobic policies and supporting
            systemic inequality. After all, what’s more impactful — a singular
            racist like Derbyshire or Arizona’s immigration law? A column or
            voter suppression? Getting rid of one racist from one publication
            doesn’t change the fact that the conservative agenda is one that
            disproportionately punishes and discriminates against people of
            color. So, I’m sorry, folks — you don’t get to support structural
            inequality and then give yourself a pat on the back for not being
            overtly racist.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The ‘conservative agenda’ cannot ever be dreamy (hopeful and
        inconsistent) enough to escape accusations of racism – that’s intrinsic
        to the way the racial dialectic works. Policies broadly compatible with
        capitalistic development, oriented to the rewarding of low
        time-preference, and thus punishing impulsivity, will reliably have a
        disparate impact upon the least economically functional social groups.
        Of course, the dialectic demands that the racial aspect of this
        disparate impact can and must be strongly emphasized (for the purpose of
        condemning incentives to human capital formation as racist), and at the
        same time forcefully denied (in order to denounce
        <em>exactly the same observation</em> as racist stereotyping). Anyone
        who expects conservatives to navigate this double-bind with political
        agility and grace must somehow have missed the late 20th century. For
        instance, the <del>doomed loser idiots</del> conservatives at the
        <em>Washington Examiner</em>,
        <a href="http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/house-dems-trained-make-race-issue/537146"
          target="_blank">noticing</a>
        with alarm that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>House Democrats received training this week on how to address the
            issue of race to defend government programs … The prepared content
            of a Tuesday presentation to the House Democratic Caucus and staff
            indicates that Democrats will seek to portray apparently neutral
            free-market rhetoric as being charged with racial bias, conscious or
            unconscious.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There are no alternative versions of an ever more perfect union, because
        union is the alternative to alternatives. Searching for where the
        alternatives might once have been found, where liberty still meant
        <em>exit</em>, and where dialectics were dissolved in space, leads into
        a clown-house of horrors, fabricated as the shadow, or significant
        other, of the Cathedral. Since the right never had a unity of its own,
        it was given one. Call it the Cracker Factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        When James C. Bennett, in <em>The Anglosphere Challenge</em>, sought to
        identify the principal cultural characteristics of the English-speaking
        world, the resulting list was generally familiar. It included, besides
        the language itself, common law traditions, individualism, comparatively
        high-levels of economic and technological openness, and distinctively
        emphatic reservations about centralized political power. Perhaps the
        most striking feature, however, was a marked cultural tendency to settle
        disagreements in space, rather than time, opting for territorial schism,
        separatism, independence, and flight, in place of revolutionary
        transformation within an integrated territory. When Anglophones
        disagree, they have often sought to dissociate in space. Instead of an
        integral resolution (regime change), they pursue a plural irresolution
        (through regime division), proliferating polities, localizing power, and
        diversifying systems of government. Even in its present, highly
        attenuated form, this anti-dialectical, de-synthesizing predisposition
        to social disaggregation finds expression in a stubborn, sussurous
        hostility to globalist political projects, and in a vestigial attraction
        to federalism (in its fissional sense).
      </p>
      <p>
        Splitting, or fleeing, is all <em>exit</em>, and (non-recuperable)
        anti-dialectics. It is the basic well-spring of liberty within the
        Anglophone tradition. If the function of a Cracker Factory is to block
        off all the exits, there’s only one place to build it – right here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like Hell, or Auschwitz, the Cracker Factory has a simple slogan
        inscribed upon its gate: <em>Escape is racist</em>. That is why the
        expression ‘white flight’ – which says exactly the same thing – has
        never been denounced for its political incorrectness, despite the fact
        that it draws upon an ethnic statistical generalization of the kind that
        would, in any other case, provoke paroxysms of outrage. ‘White flight’
        is no more ‘white’ than low time-preference is, but this broad-brush
        insensitivity is deemed acceptable, because it structurally supports the
        Cracker Factory, and the indispensable confusion of ancient (or
        negative) liberty with original (racial) sin.

      <h5><em>Odd Marriages</em></h5>
      <p>
        The origins of the word ‘cracker’ as a term of ethnic derision are
        distant and obscure. It seems to have already circulated, as a slur
        targeting poor southern whites of predominantly Celtic ancestry, in the
        mid-18th century, derived perhaps from ‘corn-cracker’ or the Scots-Irish
        ‘crack’ (banter). The rich semantic complexion of the term, inextricable
        from the identification of elaborate racial, cultural, and class
        characteristics, is comparable to that of its unmentionable dusky cousin
        – “the ‘<a
          href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2012/06/gwyneth_paltrow_and_niggas_in_paris_is_it_ever_ok_for_white_people_to_use_the_word_.html"
          target="_blank">N-</a>‘<a href="http://glpiggy.net/2012/06/12/it-wont-stop/" target="_blank">word</a>” – and
        draws from the same well of generally recognized but forbidden
        truths. In particular, and emphatically, it testifies to the
        <em>illicit truism</em> that people are more excited and animated by
        their differences than by their commonalities, ‘clinging bitterly’ – or
        at least tenaciously – to their non-uniformity, and obstinately
        resisting the universal categories of enlightened population management.
        Crackers are grit in the clockwork of progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most delectable features of the slur, however, are entirely
        fortuitous (or Qabbalistic). ‘Crackers’ break codes, safes, organic
        chemicals – sealed or bonded systems of all kinds – with eventual
        geopolitical implication. They anticipate a <em>crack-up</em>, schism or
        secession, confirming their association with the anathematized
        disintegrative undercurrent of Anglophone history. No surprise, then –
        despite the linguistic jumps and glitching – that the figure of the
        recalcitrant cracker evokes a still-unpacified South, insubordinate to
        the manifest destiny of Union. This returns it, by short-circuit, to the
        most problematic depths of its meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Contradictions</em> demand resolution, but <em>cracks</em> can
        continue to widen, deepen, and spread. According to the cracker ethos,
        when things can fall apart – it’s OK. There’s no need to reach
        agreement, when it’s possible to split. This <em>cussedness</em>,
        pursued to its limit, tends to a hill-billy stereotype set in a shack or
        rusting trailer at the end of an Appalachian mountain path, where all
        economic transactions are conducted in cash (or moonshine), interactions
        with government agents are conducted across the barrel of a loaded
        shotgun, and timeless anti-political wisdom is summed in the
        don’t-tread-on-me reflex: “Get off my porch.” Naturally, this disdain
        for integrative debate (dialectics) is coded within the mainstream of
        Anglocentric global history – which is to say, Yankee evangelical
        Puritanism – as a deficiency not only of cultural sophistication, but
        also of basic intelligence, and even the most scrupulous adherent of
        social constructivist righteousness immediately reverts to
        hard-hereditarian psychometrics when confronted by cracker
        obstreperousness. To those for whom a broad trend of socio-political
        progress seems like a simple, incontestable fact, the refusal to
        recognize anything of the kind is perceived as clear evidence of
        retardation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since stereotypes generally have high statistical truth-value, it’s more
        than possible that crackers are clustered heavily on the left of the
        white IQ bell-curve, concentrated there by generations of dysgenic
        pressure. If, as Charles Murray argues, the efficiency of meritocratic
        selection within American society has steadily risen and conspired with
        assortative mating to transform class differences into genetic castes,
        it would be passing strange if the cracker stratum were to be
        characterized by conspicuous cognitive elevation. Yet some awkwardly
        intriguing questions intervene at this point, as long as one diligently
        pursues the stereotype. Assortative mating? How can that work, when
        crackers marry their cousins? Oh yes, there’s <em>that</em>. Drawing on
        population groups beyond the north-western

        exogamous Anglo (WASP) norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tireless ‘<a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">hbdchick</a>’ is the crucial resource on
        this topic. Over the course of a truly
        monumental series of blog
        <a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/start-here/" target="_blank">posts</a>, she employs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Hamilton" target="_blank">Hamiltonian</a>
        conceptual tools to investigate the borderland where nature and culture
        intersect, comprising kinship structures, the differentiations they
        require in the calculus of inclusive fitness, and the distinctive ethnic
        profiles in the evolutionary psychology of altruism that result. In
        particular, she directs attention to the abnormality of (North-West)
        European history, where obligatory exogamy – through rigorous
        proscription of cousin marriage – has prevailed for 1,600 years. This
        distinctive orientation towards outbreeding, she suggests, plausibly
        accounts for a variety of bio-cultural peculiarities, the most
        historically significant of which is a unique pre-eminence of reciprocal
        (over familial) altruism, as indicated by emphatic individualism,
        nuclear families, an affinity with ‘corporate’ (kinship-free)
        institutions, highly-developed contractual relationships among
        strangers, relatively low levels of nepotism / corruption, and robust
        forms of social cohesion independent of tribal bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inbreeding, in contrast, creates a selective environment favoring tribal
        collectivism, extended systems of family loyalty and honor, distrust of
        non-relatives and impersonal institutions, and – in general – those
        ‘clannish’ traits which mesh uncomfortably with the leading values of
        (Eurocentric) modernity, and are thus denounced for their primitive
        ‘xenophobia’ and ‘corruption’. Clannish values, of course, are bred in
        clans, such as those populating Britain’s Celtic fringe and borderlands,
        where cousin marriage persisted, along with its associated
        socio-economic and cultural forms, especially herding (rather than
        farming), and a disposition towards extreme, vendetta-style
        <a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/culture-of-honor/" target="_blank">violence</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This analysis introduces the central paradox of ‘white identity’, since
        the specifically European ethnic traits that have structured the moral
        order of modernity, slanting it away from tribalism and towards
        reciprocal altruism, are inseparable from a unique heritage of
        outbreeding that is intrinsically corrosive of ethnocentric solidarity.
        In other words: it is almost exactly weak ethnic groupishness that makes
        a group ethnically modernistic, competent at ‘corporate’ (non-familial)
        institution building, and thus objectively privileged / advantaged
        within the dynamic of modernity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paradox is most fully expressed in the radical forms of European
        ethnocentric revivalism exemplified by paleo- and neo-Nazism,
        confounding its proponents and antagonists alike. When exceptionally
        advanced ‘race-treachery’ is your quintessential racial feature, the
        opportunity for viable ethno-supremacist politics disappears into a
        logical abyss – even if occasions for large-scale trouble-making no
        doubt remain. Admittedly, a Nazi, by definition, is willing (and eager)
        to sacrifice modernity upon the altar of racial purity, but this is
        either not to understand, or to tragically affirm, the inevitable
        consequence – which is to be out-modernized (and thus defeated).
        Identity politics is for losers, inherently and unalterably, due to an
        essentially parasitical character that only works from the left. Because
        inbreeding systematically contra-indicates for modern power, racial
        <em>Übermenschen</em> make no real sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, however endlessly fascinating Nazis may be, they are not
        any kind of reliable key to the history or direction of
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracker-Culture-Celtic-Ways-South/dp/0817304584" target="_blank">cracker
          culture</a>, beyond setting a logical limit to the programmatic construction and
        usage of white identity politics. Tattooing swastikas on their foreheads
        does nothing to change that. (<a href="http://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/hatfields-and-mccoys/"

      <p>
        The conjunction taking place in the Cracker Factory is quite different,
        and far more perplexing, entangling the urbane, cosmopolitan advocates
        of hyper-contractarian marketization with romantic traditionalists,
        ethno-particularists, and nostalgics of the ‘Lost Cause’. It is first
        necessary to understand this entanglement in its full, mind-melting
        weirdness, before exploring its lessons. For that, some semi-random
        stripped-down data-points might be helpful:

        … perhaps that’s enough to be going on with (although there’s plenty
        more within easy reach). These points have been selected, questionably,
        crudely, and prejudicially, to lend impressionistic support to a single
        basic thesis:
        <em>fundamental socio-historical forces are crackerizing
          libertarianism</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the tentative research conclusions drawn by hbdchick are accepted as
        a frame, the oddity of this marriage between libertarian and
        neo-confederate themes is immediately apparent. When positioned on a
        bio-cultural axis, defined by degrees of outbreeding, the absence of
        overlap – or even proximity – is dramatically exposed. One pole is
        occupied by a radically individualistic doctrine, focused
        near-exclusively upon mutable networks of voluntary interchange of an
        economic type (and notoriously insensitive to the very existence of
        non-negotiable social bonds). Close to the other pole lies a rich
        culture of local attachment, extended family, honor, contempt for
        commercial values, and distrust of strangers. The distilled rationality
        of fluid capitalism is juxtaposed to traditional hierarchy and
        non-alienable value. The absolute prioritization of <em>exit</em> is
        jumbled amongst folkways from which no exit is even imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stapling the two together, however, is a simple, ever more irresistible
        conclusion: liberty has no future in the Anglophone world outside the
        prospect of secession. The coming crack-up is the only way out.

          Conceived generically, modernity is a social condition defined by an
          integral trend, summarized as sustained economic growth rates that
          exceed population increases, and thus mark an escape from normal
          history, caged within the Malthusian trap. When, in the interest of
          dispassionate appraisal, analysis is restricted to the terms of this
          basic quantitative pattern, it supports sub-division into the (growth)
          positive and negative components of the trend: techno-industrial
          (scientific and commercial) contributions to accelerating development on
          the one hand, and socio-political counter-tendencies towards the capture
          of economic product by democratically empowered rent-seeking special
          interests on the other (<a
            href="http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/demosclerosis_the_original_article/"
            target="_blank">demosclerosis</a>). What classical liberalism gives (industrial revolution) mature
          liberalism takes away (via the cancerous entitlement state). In abstract
          geometry, it describes an S-curve of self-limiting runaway. As a drama
          of liberation, it is a broken promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceived particularly, as a singularity, or real <em>thing</em>,
          modernity has ethno-geographical characteristics that complicate and
          qualify its mathematical purity. It came from somewhere, imposed itself
          more widely, and brought the world’s various peoples into an
          extraordinary range of novel relations. These relations were
          characteristically ‘modern’ if they involved an overflowing of previous
          Malthusian limits, enabling capital accumulation, and initiating new
          demographic trends, but they conjoined concrete groups rather than
          abstract economic functions. At least in appearance, therefore,
          modernity was something done by people of a certain kind with, and not
          uncommonly to (or even against), other people, who were conspicuously
          unlike them. By the time it was faltering on the fading slope of the
          S-curve, in the early 20th century, resistance to its generic features
          (‘capitalistic alienation’) had become almost entirely indistinguishable
          from opposition to its particularity (‘European imperialism’ and ‘white
          supremacy’). As an inevitable consequence, the modernistic
          self-consciousness of the system’s ethno-geographical core slid

          Third Reich.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given modernity’s inherent trend to degeneration or self-cancellation,
          three broad prospects open. These are not strictly exclusive, and are
          therefore not true alternatives, but for schematic purposes it is
          helpful to present them as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Modernity 2.0. Global modernization is re-invigorated from a new
          ethno-geographical core, liberated from the degenerate structures of its
          Eurocentric predecessor, but no doubt confronting long range trends of
          an equally mortuary character. This is by far the most encouraging and
          plausible scenario (from a pro-modernist perspective), and if China
          remains even approximately on its current track it will be assuredly
          realized. (India, sadly, seems to be too far gone in its native version
          of demosclerosis to seriously compete.)
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Postmodernity. Amounting essentially to a new dark age, in which
          Malthusian limits brutally re-impose themselves, this scenario assumes
          that Modernity 1.0 has so radically globalized its own morbidity that
          the entire future of the world collapses around it. If the Cathedral
          ‘wins’ this is what we have coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Western Renaissance. To be reborn it is first necessary to die, so
          the harder the ‘hard reboot’ the better. Comprehensive crisis and
          disintegration offers the best odds (most realistically as a sub-theme
          of option #1).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because competition is good, a pinch of Western Renaissance would spice
          things up, even if – as is overwhelmingly probable — Modernity 2.0 is
          the world’s principal highway to the future. That depends upon the West
          stopping and reversing pretty much everything it has been doing for over
          a century, excepting only scientific, technological, and business
          innovation. It is advisable to maintain rhetorical discipline within a
          strictly hypothetical mode, because the possibility of any of these
          things is deeply colored by incredibility:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Replacement of representational democracy by constitutional
          republicanism (or still more
          <a href="http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/12/18/rampant-moldbuggery" target="_blank">extreme</a>
          anti-political governmental mechanisms).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Massive downsizing of government and its rigorous confinement to
          core functions (<a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf" target="_blank">at
            most</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Restoration of hard money (precious metal coins and bullion deposit
          notes) and abolition of central banking.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Dismantling of state monetary and fiscal discretion, thus abolishing
          practical macroeconomics and liberating the autonomous (or
          ‘catallactic’) economy. (This point is redundant, since it follows
          rigorously from 2 &amp; 3 above, but it’s the real prize, so worth
          emphasizing.)
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s more – which is to say, less politics – but it’s already
          absolutely clear that none of this is going to happen short of an
          existential civilizational cataclysm. Asking politicians to limit their
          own powers is a non-starter, but nothing less heads even remotely in the
          right direction. This, however, isn’t even the widest or deepest
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democracy might begin as a defensible procedural mechanism for limiting
          government power, but it quickly and inexorably develops into something
          quite different: a culture of systematic thievery. As soon as
          politicians have learnt to buy political support from the ‘public
          purse’, and conditioned electorates to embrace looting and bribery, the
          democratic process reduces itself to the formation of (Mancur Olson’s)
          ‘distributional coalitions’ – electoral majorities mortared together by
          common interest in a collectively advantageous pattern of theft. Worse
          still, since people are, on average, not very bright, the scale of
          depredation available to the political establishment far exceeds even
          the demented sacking that is open to public scrutiny. Looting the
          future, through currency debauchment, debt accumulation, growth
          destruction, and techno-industrial retardation is especially easy to
          conceal, and thus reliably popular. Democracy is essentially tragic
          because it provides the populace with a weapon to destroy itself, one
          that is always eagerly seized, and used. Nobody ever says ‘no’ to free
          stuff. Scarcely anybody even sees that there is no free stuff. Utter
          cultural ruination is the necessary conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the final phase of Modernity 1.0, American history becomes the
          master narrative of the world. It is there that the great Abrahamic
          cultural conveyor culminates in the secularized neo-puritanism of the
          Cathedral, as it establishes the New Jerusalem in Washington DC. The
          apparatus of Messianic-revolutionary purpose is consolidated in the
          evangelical state, which is authorized by any means necessary to install
          a new world order of universal fraternity, in the name of equality,
          human rights, social justice, and – above all – <em>democracy</em>. The
          absolute moral confidence of the Cathedral underwrites the enthusiastic
          pursuit of unrestrained centralized power, optimally unlimited in its
          intensive penetration and its extensive scope.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an irony altogether hidden from the witch-burners’ spawn
          themselves, the ascent of this squinting cohort of grim moral fanatics
          to previously unscaled heights of global power coincides with the
          descent of mass-democracy to previously unimagined depths of gluttonous
          corruption. Every five years America steals itself from itself again,
          and fences itself back in exchange for political support.
          <em>This democracy thing is easy – you just vote for the guy who promises
            you the most stuff. An idiot could do it.</em>
          Actually, it likes idiots, treats them with apparent kindness, and does
          everything it can to manufacture more of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democracy’s relentless trend to degeneration presents an implicit case
          for reaction. Since every major threshold of socio-political ‘progress’
          has ratcheted Western civilization towards comprehensive ruin, a
          retracing of its steps suggests a reversion from the society of pillage
          to an older order of self-reliance, honest industry and exchange,
          pre-propagandistic learning, and civic self-organization. The
          attractions of this reactionary vision are evidenced by the vogue for
          18th century attire, symbols, and constitutional documents among the
          substantial (Tea Party) minority who clearly see the disastrous course
          of American political history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Has the ‘race’ alarm sounded in your head yet? It would be amazing if it
          hadn’t. Stagger back in imagination before 2008, and the fraught whisper
          of conscience is already questioning your prejudices against Kenyan
          revolutionaries and black Marxist professors. Remain in reverse until
          the Great Society / Civil Rights era and the warnings reach hysterical
          pitch. It’s perfectly obvious by this point that American political
          history has progressed along twin, interlocking tracks, corresponding to
          the <em>capacity</em> and the <em>legitimation</em> of the state. To
          cast doubt upon its scale and scope is to simultaneously dispute the
          sanctity of its purpose, and the moral-spiritual necessity that it
          command whatever resources, and impose whatever legal restraints, may be
          required to effectively fulfill it. More specifically, to recoil from
          the magnitude of Leviathan is to demonstrate insensitivity to the
          immensity – indeed, near infinity – of inherited racial guilt, and the
          sole surviving categorical imperative of senescent modernity –
          government needs to <em>do more</em>. The possibility, indeed near
          certainty, that the pathological consequences of chronic government
          activism have long ago supplanted the problems they originally targeted,
          is a contention so utterly maladapted to the epoch of democratic
          religion that its practical insignificance is assured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even on the left, it would be extraordinary to find many who genuinely
          believe, after sustained reflection, that the primary driver of
          government expansion and centralization has been the burning desire
          <em>to do good</em> (not that intentions matter). Yet, as the twin
          tracks cross, such is the electric jolt of moral drama, leaping the gap
          from racial Golgotha to intrusive Leviathan, that skepticism is
          suspended, and the great progressive myth installed.
          <em>The alternative to more government, doing ever more, was to stand
            there, negligently, whilst they lynched another Negro</em>. This proposition contains the entire essential
          content of American
          progressive education.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twin historical tracks of state capability and purpose can be
          conceived as a translation protocol, enabling any recommended restraint
          upon government power to be ‘decoded’ as malign obstruction of racial
          justice. This system of substitutions functions so smoothly that it
          provides an entire vocabulary of (bipartisan) ‘code-words’ or
          ‘dog-whistles’ – ‘welfare’, ‘freedom of association’, ‘states rights’ –
          ensuring that any intelligible utterance on the Principal (left-right)
          Political Dimension occupies a double registry, semi-saturated by racial
          evocations. Reactionary regression smells of strange fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
          … and that is before backing out of the calamitous 20th century. It was
          not the Civil Rights Era, but the ‘American Civil War’ (in the terms of
          the victors) or ‘War between the States’ (in those of the vanquished)
          that first indissolubly cross-coded the practical question of Leviathan
          with (black/white) racial dialectics, laying down the central junction
          yard of subsequent political antagonism and rhetoric. The indispensable
          primary step in comprehending this fatality snakes along an awkward
          diagonal between mainstream statist and revisionist accounts, because
          the conflagration that consumed the American nation in the early 1860s
          was wholly but non-exclusively about emancipation from slavery
          <em>and</em> about
          <a href="http://dixienet.org/rights/whatisstatesrights10252010.shtml" target="_blank">states rights</a>, with
          neither ‘cause’ reducible to the other, or sufficient to
          suppress the war’s enduring ambiguities. Whilst there are any number of
          ‘liberals’ happy to celebrate the consolidation of centralized
          government power in the triumphant Union, and, symmetrically, a (far
          smaller) number of neo-confederate apologists for the institution of
          chattel slavery in the southern states, neither of these unconflicted
          stances capture the dynamic cultural legacy of a
          <em>war across the codes</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war is a knot. By practically dissociating liberty into
          <em>emancipation</em> and <em>independence</em>, then hurling each
          against the other in a half-decade of carnage, blue against gray, it was
          settled that freedom would be broken on the battlefield, whatever the
          outcome of the conflict. Union victory determined that the emancipatory
          sense of liberty would prevail, not only in America, but throughout the
          world, and the eventual reign of the Cathedral was assured.
          Nevertheless, the crushing of American’s second war of secession made a
          mockery of the first. If the institution of slavery de-legitimated a war
          of independence, what survived of 1776? The moral coherence of the Union
          cause required that the founders were reconceived as politically
          illegitimate white patriarchal slave-owners, and American history
          combusted in progressive education and the culture wars.
        </p>
        <p>
          If independence is the ideology of slave-holders, emancipation requires
          the programmatic destruction of independence. Within a cross-coded
          history, the realization of freedom is indistinguishable from its
          abolition.

        <h4 class="post-title">The Dark Enlightenment (Part 4f(inal))</h4>
      </a>
      <h5><em>Approaching the Bionic Horizon</em></h5>
      <p>
        It’s time to bring this long digression to a conclusion, by reaching out
        impatiently towards the end. The basic theme has been mind control, or
        thought-suppression, as demonstrated by the Media-Academic complex that
        dominates contemporary Western societies, and which Mencius Moldbug
        names the Cathedral. When things are squashed they rarely disappear.
        Instead, they are displaced, fleeing into sheltering shadows, and
        sometimes turning into monsters. Today, as the suppressive orthodoxy of
        the Cathedral comes unstrung, in various ways, and numerous senses, a
        time of monsters is approaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The central dogma of the Cathedral
        <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/steen/cogweb/ep/EP-primer.html" target="_blank">has</a>
        <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-harvey-s-race-and-equality-the-standard-social-science-model-is-w-r-o-n-g"
          target="_blank">been</a>
        formalized as the Standard Social Scientific Model (SSSM) or ‘blank
        slate theory’. It is the belief, completed in its essentials by the
        anthropology of
        <a href="http://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/pdfs/Passion_of_Franz_Boas.pdf" target="_blank">Franz Boas</a>, that
        every legitimate question about mankind is restricted to the
        sphere of culture. Nature permits <em>that</em> ‘man’ is, but never
        determines <em>what</em> man is. Questions directed towards natural
        characteristics and variations between humans are themselves properly
        understood as cultural peculiarities, or even pathologies. Failures of
        ‘nurture’ are the only thing we are allowed to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Cathedral has a consistent ideological orientation, and
        sifts its enemies accordingly, comparatively detached scientific
        appraisal of the SSSM easily veers into raw antagonism. As Simon
        Blackburn
        <a href="http://www.powells.com/review/2002_11_21.html" target="_blank">remarks</a>
        (in a thoughtful review of Steven Pinker’s <em>The Blank Slate</em>),
        “The dichotomy between nature and nurture rapidly acquires political and
        emotional implications. To put it crudely, the right likes genes and the
        left likes culture …”
      </p>
      <p>
        At the limit of reciprocal loathing, hereditarian determinism confronts
        social constructivism, with each committed to a radically pared-back
        model of causality. <em>Either</em> nature expresses itself as culture,
        <em>or</em> culture expresses itself in its images (‘constructions’) of
        nature. Both of these positions are trapped at opposite sides of an
        incomplete circuit, structurally blinded to
        <em>the culture of practical naturalism</em>, which is to say: the
        techno-scientific / industrial manipulation of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acquiring knowledge and using tools is a single dynamic circuit,
        producing techno-science as an integral system, without real
        divisibility into theoretical and practical aspects. Science develops in
        loops, through experimental <em>technique</em> and the production of
        ever more sophisticated instrumentation, whilst embedded within a
        broader industrial process. Its advance is the improvement of a machine.
        This intrinsically technological character of (modern) science
        demonstrates the <em>efficiency</em> of culture as a complex natural
        force. It neither expresses a pre-existing natural circumstance, nor
        does it merely construct social representations. Instead, nature and
        culture compose a dynamic circuit, at the edge of nature, where fate is
        decided.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the self-reinforcing presupposition of modernization, to be
        understood is to be modifiable. It is to be expected, therefore, that
        biology and medicine co-evolve. The same historical dynamic that
        comprehensively subverts the SSSM through inundating waves of scientific
        discovery simultaneously volatilizes human biological identity through
        biotechnology. There is no essential difference between learning what we
        <em>really are</em> and re-defining ourselves as technological
        contingencies, or <em>technoplastic</em> beings, susceptible to precise,
        scientifically-informed transformations. ‘Humanity’ becomes intelligible
        as it is subsumed into the technosphere, where information processing of
        the genome – for instance — brings reading and editing into perfect
        coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        To describe this circuit, as it consumes the human species, is to define
        our <em>bionic horizon</em>: the threshold of conclusive nature-culture
        fusion at which a population becomes indistinguishable from its
        technology. This is neither hereditarian determinism, nor social
        constructivism, but it is what both would have referred to, had they
        indicated anything real. It is a syndrome vividly anticipated by Octavia
        Butler, whose
        <em><a href="http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/books/butler1.html" target="_blank">Xenogenesis</a></em>
        trilogy is devoted to the examination of a population beyond the bionic
        horizon. Her Oankali ‘gene traders’ have no identity separable from the
        biotechnological program that they perpetually implement upon
        themselves, as they commercially acquire, industrially produce, and
        sexually reproduce their population within a single, integral process.
        Between what the Oankali are, and the way they live, or behave, there is
        no firm difference. Because they make themselves, their nature is their
        culture and (of course) reciprocally. What they <em>are</em> is exactly
        what they <em>do</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Religious traditionalists of the Western Orthosphere are right to
        identify the looming bionic horizon with a (negative) theological event.
        Techno-scientific auto-production specifically supplants the fixed and
        sacralized essence of man as a created being, amidst the greatest
        upheaval in the natural order since the emergence of eukaryotic life,
        half a billion years ago. It is not merely an evolutionary event, but
        the threshold of a new <em>evolutionary phase</em>. John H. Campbell
        heralds the emergence of <em>Homo autocatalyticus</em>, whilst
        <a href="http://www.neoeugenics.net/camp.htm" target="_blank">arguing</a>: “In point of fact, it is hard to
        imagine how a system of inheritance
        could be more ideal for engineering than ours is.”
      </p>
      <p>
        John H. Campbell? – a prophet of monstrosity, and the perfect excuse for
        a monster quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>“Biologists suspect that new forms evolve rapidly from very tiny
            outgroups of individuals (perhaps even a single fertilized female,
            Mayr, 1942) at the fringe of an existing species. There the stress
            of an all but uninhabitable environment, forced inbreeding among
            isolated family members, “introgression” of foreign genes from
            neighboring species, lack of other members of the species to compete
            against or whatever, promotes a major reorganization of the genomic
            program, possibly from modest change in gene structure. Nearly all
            of these transmogrified fragments of species die out, but an
            occasional one is fortunate enough to fit a new viable niche. It
            prospers and expands into a new species. Its conversion into a
            statistically constrained gene pool then stabilizes the species from
            further evolutionary change. Established species are far more
            notable for their stasis than change. Even throwing off a new
            daughter species does not seem to change an existing species. No one
            denies that species can gradually transform and do so to various
            extents, but this so-called “anagenesis” is relatively unimportant
            compared to geologically-sudden major saltation in the generation of
            novelty.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>Three implications are important.</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>1. Most evolutionary change is associated with the origin of new
            species.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>2. Several modes of evolution may operate simultaneously. In this
            case the most effective dominates the process.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>3. Tiny minorities of individuals do most of the evolving instead
            of the species as a whole.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A second important characteristic of evolution is self-reference
            (Campbell, 1982). The Cartesian cartoon of an autonomous external
            “environment” dictating the form of a species like a cookie cutter
            cutting stencils from sheets of dough is dead, dead wrong. The
            species molds its environment as profoundly as the environment
            “evolves” the species. In particular, the organisms cause the
            limiting conditions of the environment over which they compete.
            Therefore the genes play two roles in evolution. They are the
            targets of natural selection and they also ultimately induce and
            determine the selection pressures that act upon them. This circular
            causality overwhelms the mechanical character of evolution.
            Evolution is dominated by feedback of the evolved activities of
            organisms on their evolution.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The third seminal realization is that evolution extends past the
            change in organisms as products of evolution to change in the
            process itself. Evolution evolves (Jantsch, 1976; Balsh, 1989;
            Dawkins, 1989; Campbell, 1993). Evolutionists know this fact but
            have never accorded the fact the importance that it deserves because
            it is incommensurate with Darwinism. Darwinists, and especially
            modern neodarwinists, equate evolution to the operation of a simple
            logical principle, one that is prior to biology: Evolution is merely
            the Darwinian principle of natural selection in action, and this is
            what the science of evolution is about. Since principles cannot
            change with time or circumstances, evolution must be fundamentally
            static.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Of course, biological evolution is not like this at all. It is an
            actual complex process, not a principle. The way that it takes place
            can, and indisputably does, change with time. This is of utmost
            importance because the process of evolution advances as it proceeds
            (Campbell, 1986). Preliving matter in the earth’s primordial soup
            was able to evolve only by subdarwinian “chemical” mechanisms. Once
            these puny processes created gene molecules with information for
            their self-replication then evolution was able to engage natural
            selection. Evolution then wrapped the self-replicating genomes
            within self-replicating organisms to control the way that life would
            respond to the winds of selection from the environment. Later, by
            creating multicellular organisms, evolution gained access to
            morphological change as an alternative to slower and less versatile
            biochemical evolution. Changes in the instructions in developmental
            programs replaced changes in enzyme catalysts. Nervous systems
            opened the way for still faster and more potent behavioral, social
            and cultural evolution. Finally, these higher modes produced the
            prerequisite organization for rational, purposeful evolution, guided
            and propelled by goal-directed minds. Each of these steps
            represented a new emergent level of evolutionary capability.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Thus, there are two distinct, but interwoven, evolutionary
            processes. I call them “adaptive evolution” and “generative
            evolution.” The former is familiar Darwinian modification of
            organisms to enhance their survival and reproductive success.
            Generative evolution is entirely different. It is the change in a
            process instead of structure. Moreover, that process is ontological.
            Evolution literally means “to unfold” and what is unfolding is the
            capacity to evolve. Higher animals have become increasingly adept at
            evolving. In contrast, they are not the least bit fitter than their
            ancestors or the lowest form of microbe. Every species today has had
            exactly the same track record of survival; on average, every higher
            organism alive today still will leave only two offspring, as was the
            case a hundred million years ago, and modern species are as likely
            to go extinct as were those in the past. Species cannot become
            fitter and fitter because reproductive success is not a cumulative
            parameter.</em>

        For racial nationalists, concerned that their grandchildren should look
        like them, Campbell is the abyss. Miscegenation doesn’t get close to the
        issue. <em>Think face tentacles</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Campbell is also a secessionist, although entirely undistracted by the
        concerns of identity politics (racial purity) or traditional cognitive
        elitism (eugenics). Approaching the bionic horizon, secessionism takes
        on an altogether wilder and more monstrous bearing – towards
        <em>speciation</em>. The folks at euvolution
        <a href="http://www.euvolution.com/eugenics/radical_intervention.html" target="_blank">capture</a>
        the scenario well:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Reasoning that the majority of humankind will not voluntarily
            accept qualitative population-management policies, Campbell points
            out that any attempt to raise the IQ of the whole human race would
            be tediously slow. He further points out that the general thrust of
            early eugenics was not so much species improvement as the prevention
            of decline. Campbell’s eugenics, therefore, advocates the
            abandonment of Homo sapiens as a ‘relic’ or ‘living fossil’ and the
            application of genetic technologies to intrude upon the genome,
            probably writing novel genes from scratch using a DNA synthesizer.
            Such eugenics would be practiced by elite groups, whose achievements
            would so quickly and radically outdistance the usual tempo of
            evolution that within ten generation the new groups will have
            advanced beyond our current form to the same degree that we
            transcend apes.</em>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        When seen from the bionic horizon, whatever emerges from the dialectics
        of racial terror remains trapped in trivialities. It’s time to move on.

        <h4 class="post-title">Malthusian Horror</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        The post is pitched like this because it’s Friday night, but it works. A
        more dutiful post might have been entitled simply ‘Malthus’ and involved
        a lot of work. That’s going to be needed at some point. (<a
          href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Malthus/malPlongCover.html">Here</a>‘s the 6th edition of <em>An Essay on
          the Principle of Population</em>,
        for anyone who wants to get started now.) A more thoroughly technical
        approach would have been flagged ‘Neo-Malthusianism’. While sympathizing
        with groans about another ‘neo-‘ prefix, in this case it would have been
        solidly justified. It’s only through expansion of the Malthusian insight
        in accordance with a more general conservation law that its full current
        relevance can be appreciated. Classic Malthus still does far more work
        than it is credited with, but it contains a <em>principle</em> of far
        more penetrating application.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Neo-‘ at its most frivolous is merely a mark of fashion. When employed
        more seriously, it notes an element of innovation. Its most significant
        sense includes not only novelty, but also abstraction. Something is
        carried forwards in such a way that its conceptual core is distilled
        through extraction from a specific context, achieving a higher
        generality, and more exact formality. Malthus partially anticipates this
        in a phrase that points beyond any excessively constrictive
        concreteness:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.xenosystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Malthus00.jpg"><img alt="Malthus00"

            width="284" /></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The qualification “in some shape or other” might have been drawn from
        abstract horror, and “premature death” only loosely binds it. Even so,
        this formulation remains too narrow, since it tends to exclude the
        <a
          href="http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/articles/Weiss,%20Volkmar.%20%22The%20Population%20Cycle%20Drives%20Human%20History%20_%20from%20a%20Eugenic%20Phase%20into%20a%20Dysgenic%20Phase%20and%20Eventual%20Collapse.%22%20The%20Journal%20of%20Social,%20Political%20and%20Economic%20Studies%2032%20(2007).pdf">dysgenic</a>
        outcome, which we have since
        <a href="http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/a_farewell_to_alms.html">learnt</a>
        is a dimension of Malthusian expression scarcely less imposing than
        resource crisis. A Neo-Malthusian account of the “X” which
        <em>in some shape or other</em> makes a grim perversity of all
        humanity’s efforts to improve its condition grasps it as a
        mathematically conserved, plastic, or abstract destiny, working as
        remorselessly through reductions of mortality (Malthusian ‘relaxations’)
        as through increases (Malthusian ‘pressures’). Both would count equally
        as “checks on population” — each convertible, through a complex
        calculus, into the terms of the other. A population dysgenically
        deteriorated through ‘enlightened’ Malthusian relaxation learns, once
        again, how to starve.

        catalyzed
        by the work of Mencius Moldbug, but it was to
        have had two Anglo-Thomistic or Doubting Thomas intellectual-historical
        pillars (and neither were Thomas Carlyle). The first was Thomas Hobbes,
        who was at least touched upon. The second was to have been Thomas
        Malthus, but the series was diverted into the foaming current of the
        Derbyshire <a href="http://abriefhistory.org/?p=3339">affair</a> and the
        outrages of Leftist race politics. The integrity of conception was lost.
        Had it not been, it might have been less tempting to read the
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/alphanomics/">333</a>-current as an
        Anti-Enlightenment, rather than a Counter-Enlightenment, in the sense of
        an eclipsed, alternative to the Rousseauistic calamity that prevailed.
        It would certainly attach the Scottish Enlightenment, but only under the
        definite condition that it is lashed securely to the harsh realist
        scaffolding of the Dark Enlightenment (Hobbes and Malthus),
        disillusioned of all idealism. Pretty stories are for little children

      </p>
      <p>
        Malthus subtracts all utopianism from enlightenment. He shows that
        history is put together — necessarily — in a butcher’s yard. Through
        Malthus, Ricardo discovered the Iron Law of Wages, disconnecting the
        ideas of economic advance and humanitarian redemption. Darwin effected a
        comparable (and more consequential) revision in biology, also on
        Malthusian grounds, dispelling all sentimentality from notions of
        evolutionary ‘progression’. It is from Malthus that we know, when
        anything seems to move forward, it is through being ground up against a
        cutting edge. It is when Marx attempts to put Malthus into history,
        rather than history into Malthus, that utopian dementia was resuscitated
        within economics. The anti-Malthusianism of Libertarians stigmatizes
        them as dreamy fools.
      </p>
      <p>
        With NRx, the matter is perhaps more unsettled, but the Dark

      <h5><em>Why Social Darwinism isn’t going anywhere</em></h5>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The name</em> social Darwinism
          <em>is a modern name given to the various theories of society that
            emerged in England and the United States in the 1870s, which, it is
            alleged, sought to apply biological concepts to sociology and
            politics. The term</em>
          social Darwinism<em>
            gained widespread currency when used in 1944 to oppose these earlier
            concepts. Today, because of the negative connotations of the theory
            of social Darwinism, especially after the atrocities of the Second
            World War (including the Holocaust), few people would describe
            themselves as Social Darwinists and the term is generally seen as
            pejorative. —</em>

        that bolted to the conclusion: America voted in November 2012 to spare
        itself from Social Darwinism. Yet, sadly belated as it may be, our
        rejoinder is unchanged: nothing ever gets spared from Darwinism. That’s
        what Darwinism is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that the term Social Darwinism survives only as a slur is
        abundantly telling, and suffices on its own to explain the ideological
        ‘evolution’ of recent times. In a nutshell, the dominant usage of
        ‘social Darwinism’ says “markets are a kind of Nazi thing.” Checkmate in
        one move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Markets implement a Darwinian process by eliminating failure. Schumpeter
        called it ‘creative destruction’. The principle
        <em>unit of selection</em> is the business enterprise, which is able to
        innovate, adapt, propagate, and evolve precisely insofar as it is also
        exposed to the risk of perishing. None of this is especially
        complicated, or even controversial. In a sane world it is what ‘social
        Darwinism’ would mean. It is certainly what Herbert Spencer was really
        talking about (although he never adopted the label).
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental tenet of Social Darwinism would then be compressible
        into a couple of words: <em>reality rules</em>. There’s more, of course,
        but nothing especially challenging. The further additions are really
        subtractions, or reservations – intellectual economies, negative
        principles, and non-commitments. That’s because Darwinism – whether
        ‘social’ or otherwise – is built from subtractions. Deducting all
        supernatural causality and transcendent agencies leaves Darwinism as the
        way complex structures get designed. (Not constructed, but
        <em>designed</em>, in conformity with a naturalistic theory of plans,
        blueprints, recipes, or assembly codes, of the kind that have naturally
        invited supernatural explanation. Darwinism only applies to practical
        information.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Subtractions put it together. For instance, remove the extravagant
        hypothesis that something big and benevolent is looking after us,
        whether God, the State, or some alternative Super-Dad, and the realistic
        residue indicates that our mistakes kill us. It follows that anything
        still hanging around has a history of avoiding serious mistakes, which
        it may or may not be persisting with – and persistence will tell. If
        we’re forgetting important lessons, we’ll pay (in the currency of
        survival).
      </p>
      <p>
        If this is mere tautology, as has not infrequently been alleged, then
        there’s not even any need for controversy. But of course, controversy
        there is, plentifully, and so deeply entrenched that the most banal
        expositions capture it best. Consider
        <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h843.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this</a>, from the
        self-assuredly pedestrian United States History site:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Social Darwinism was the application of Charles Darwin’s scientific
            theories of evolution and natural selection to contemporary social
            development. In nature, only the fittest survived — so too in the
            marketplace. This form of justification was enthusiastically adopted
            by many American businessmen as scientific proof of their
            superiority.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        What is this supremely typical paragraph really saying? That some
        American businesses survived, were thus seen as “the fittest” (= they
        had survived), ‘justified’ (= they had survived), and ‘proven to be
        superior’ (= they had survived), in other words, a string of perfectly
        empty identity statements that is in some way supposed to embody a
        radically disreputable form of ruthless social extremism. This same
        systematic logical error, seen with tedious insistence in all instance
        of commentary on ‘social Darwinism’, was baptized by Schopenhauer
        ‘hypostasis of the concept’. It seizes upon something, repeats it
        exactly but in different terms, and then pretends to have added
        information. Once this error is corrected for, substantial discussion of
        the topic is exposed in its full, dazzling vacuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A writhing David Boaz cites the Encyclopedia Britannica
        <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551058/social-Darwinism" rel="noopener"
          target="_blank">entry</a>
        on Social Darwinism, which describes it as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>… the theory that persons, groups, and races are subject to the
            same laws of natural selection as Charles Darwin had perceived in
            plants and animals in nature. According to the theory, which was
            popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the weak were
            diminished and their cultures delimited, while the strong grew in
            power and in cultural influence over the weak…. The poor were the
            “unfit” and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence,
            wealth was a sign of success. At the societal level, social
            Darwinism was used as a philosophical rationalization for
            imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies, sustaining belief in
            Anglo-Saxon or Aryan cultural and biological superiority.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It is immediately clear that this passage, too, follows the
        already-familiar pattern, clocking ‘hypostasis of the concept’ to the
        edge of spontaneous combustion. Worse still, it tries to put its
        hypostasized ‘information’ to work through the positive proposition —
        tacitly insinuated rather than firmly stated – that “persons, groups,
        and races” are something other than “animals in nature.” Nature, it
        seems, ceased to apply at some threshold of human social development,
        when people stopped being animals, and became something else. Man is not
        only doubled (as a natural being and something else), but divided
        between incommensurable kingdoms, whose re-integration is morally akin
        to “rationalization for imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies”
        and – why not admit it? — fascist genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define nature in such a way that we’re not part of it, or you’re engaged
        in Nazi apologetics says <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em>. There’s
        obviously something about social Darwinism that gets people excited —
        several things, actually. Plugging the spontaneous theory of
        <em>laissez faire</em> capitalism into traumatic association with the
        Third Reich is thrilling enough, especially because that’s the basic
        platform for the epoch of actually existing fascism (which we still
        inhabit), but there’s more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most obvious clue, from which the
        <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> passage unravels like a piece of
        incompetent knitting, is the magical appearance of ‘should’ – “The poor
        were the ‘unfit’ and should not be aided.” This is another preposterous
        hypostasis, naturally (and unnaturally), but equally typical. At the
        evolution site <em>talkorigins</em>, John S. Wilkins
        <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/social.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tells</a>
        us: “’Social Darwinism’ … holds that social policy should allow the weak
        and unfit to fail and die, and that this is not only good policy but
        morally right.” The intellectual perversity here is truly fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any naturalistic social theory subtracts, or at least suspends, moral
        evaluation. It says: this is the way things are (however we might want
        them to be). Yet here, through hypostatic doubling, or redundancy, such
        neutral realism is converted into a bizarre, morally-charged stance:
        <em>nature should happen</em>. Social Darwinism is not attempting to
        explain, but rather <em>siding with reality</em> (those Nazis!).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, quite simply and literally, madness. Left dissatisfied by mere
        denial of the modest proposition that reality rules, the denunciation of
        social Darwinism proceeds smoothly to the accusation that realists are
        aiding and abetting the enemy. The unforgivable crime is to accept that
        there are consequences, or results, other than those we have agreed to
        allow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is that practical decisions have real consequences. If those
        consequences are annulled by, or absorbed into, a more comprehensive
        social entity, then that entity inherits them. What it incentivizes it
        grows into. The failures it selects for become its own. When maladaptive
        decisions are displaced, or aggregated, they are not dispelled, but
        reinforced, generalized, and exacerbated. Whatever the scale of the
        social being under consideration, it either finds a way to work, and to
        reward what works, or it perishes, whether as a whole, or in pieces.
        That is the ‘social Darwinism’ that will return, eventually, because
        reality rules, and rather than joining the clamor of denunciation, Boaz
        would have been prescient to reclaim it.

        <h4 class="post-title">Discrimination</h4>
      </a>
      <p align="left">
        Bryan Caplan has
        <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/08/tribalism_misan.html">had</a>
        two epiphanies, which sum to the conclusion that — bad as tribalism is —
        misanthropy is the real problem. His ineradicable universalism betrays
        him once again.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        It matters little whether people are <em>uniformly</em> judged good or
        bad. Far more important is whether such judgment is
        <em>discriminating</em>.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The central argument of Nietzsche’s <i>The Genealogy of Morals</i> is
        clarifying in this regard, not least because it explains how radical
        mystification came to dominate the topic. How could there ever come to
        be a moral quandary about the value of discrimination? Considered
        superficially, it is extremely puzzling.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Differentiation between what is ‘good’ and ‘bad’ requires
        discrimination. This is a capability no younger than life itself, which
        it serves as an indispensable function. As soon as there is behavior,
        there is discrimination between alternatives. One way leads to survival,
        the other way leads to death. There is nourishment, or not;
        reproduction, or not; safety or predatory menace. Good and bad, or the
        discrimination between them (which is the same thing), are etched
        primordially into any world that life inhabits. Discrimination is needed
        to survive.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <span id="more-976"></span>The very existence of archaic hominids
        attests to billions of years of effective discrimination, between safety
        and danger, wholesome and putrid or poisonous food, good mates and less
        good (or worthless) ones. When these elevated apes differentiated
        between good and bad, appetizing and rotten, attractive and repulsive,
        they found such discriminations sufficiently similar in essence to be
        functionally substitutable. When judging that some food item is ‘not
        good for us’, a person is ‘rotten’, or the odor of a potential mate is
        ‘delicious’, we recall such substitutions, and the primordial sense of
        discrimination that they affirm. There can be no long-term deviation
        from the original principle:
        <i>discrimination is intelligence aligned with survival</i>.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Two contrary developments now present themselves. Firstly, there is a
        sublimation or sophistication of discrimination, which might be called
        <i>cultivation</i>. Abstract concepts, modes of expression, artworks,
        delicate culinary flavors, refined behaviors, and exotic elaborations of
        sexual-selection stimuli, among innumerable other things, can all be
        subtly discriminated on the ancient scale, supporting an ever more
        intricate and extended hierarchy of judgments. The reflexive doubling of
        this potential upon itself, as captured by the ‘higher’ judgment that
        <i>to discriminate well is good</i>, produces a ‘natural aristocracy’.
        For the first time, there is a self-conscious ‘Right’. This, at least,
        is its logico-mythical ur-form.
        <i>To divide the good from the bad is good</i>. Order, hierarchy, and
        distinction emerge from an affirmation of discrimination.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Because the Left cannot create, it comes second. It presupposes an
        existing hierarchy, or order of discriminations, which is subverted
        through a ‘slave revolt in morality’. The formula is simple enough:
        <i>to discriminate is bad</i>. Following from this leftist moral
        perversion, as its second-order consequence, those who do not
        discriminate (well), but are in fact discriminated against, must be the
        good. In the new moral order, therefore, to be bad at discrimination is
        good — or ‘universalist’ — whilst the old (and now ‘evil’) quality of
        good judgment, based on competent perception of patterns and
        differences,  is the very quintessence of sin.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lawrence Auster’s thinking, which would not usually be described as
        ‘Nietzschean’,
        <a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/022087.html">conforms</a>
        to the conclusions of the Antichrist perfectly in this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We thus arrive at our present system of mass nonwhite immigration,
          multiculturalism, racial preferences for minorities, the symbolic
          celebration of minorities, the covering up of black-on-white violence,
          and antiracism crusades directed exclusively at whites.
          <strong>Under this system, whites practice assiduous non-discrimination
            toward the unassimilated, alien, or criminal behavior of racial
            minorities, while practicing the most assiduous discrimination
            against their fellow whites for the slightest failure to be
            non-discriminatory.</strong>
          This is the system that conservatives variously describe as “political
          correctness” or the “double standard.” However, from the point of view
          of the functioning of the liberal order itself, what conservatives
          call the double standard is not a double standard at all, but a
          fundamental and necessary articulation of the society into the
          “non-discriminators” and the “non-discriminated against”—an
          articulation upon which the very legitimacy and existence of the
          liberal society depends.</em>
        [Auster’s emphasis]
      </p>
      <p>
        The racial pretext for this righteous diatribe is not incidental, given
        the prevailing sense of ‘discrimination’ in Left-edited languages.
        Caution is required, however, precisely because vulgar racism is
        <em>insufficiently discriminating</em>. All generalization lurches
        towards the universal. The abstract principle of Leftism is, in any
        case, far more general. The trend towards the Left-absolute is entirely
        clear, and pre-programmed:
        <em>no state of human existence can possibly be any better or worse than
          any other</em>, and only through recognition of this can we be saved. Do you sinfully
        imagine that it is <em>better</em> to be a damned soul like Nietzsche
        than an obese, leprous, slothful, communist, cretin? Or worse still, in
        Bryan Caplan’s world, that one might design an immigration policy on
        this basis? Then your path to the abyss is already marked out before
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not take an exceptional mastery of logic to see the
        inextinguishable contradiction in Leftist thought. If discrimination is
        bad, and non-discrimination is good, how can discrimination be
        discriminated from non-discrimination, without grave moral error? This
        is an opportunity for Rightist entertainment, but not for solace. The
        Left has power and absurdist mysticism on its side. Logic is for
        sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two hanging questions:<br />
        Can Left and Right be rigorously
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/right-and-left/">distinguished</a>
        in any other way?<br />

        There’s a further link — also to Twitter — concerning the accusation
        that Anarcho-Capitalism and Neocameralism are ‘Utopian’. I won’t
        reproduce that here, because it was longer, and more involved. The
        relevant point is that both these ‘positions’ can be construed either as
        ideals, and therefore indeed vulnerable to criticism for their
        Utopianism, or as <em>cold</em> analytical frameworks that capture
        <em>what is</em> in a way that enhances its theoretical tractability.
        Darwinism is no different, in this respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anybody who is a Cosmic Darwinist is certainly going to be a Social
        Darwinist, unless they have a cognitive consistency problem. When a
        Darwinist observes a maladaption it is not seen as a theoretical hole,
        but rather as the basis for a prediction. Whatever cannot effectively
        reproduce itself can be reliably expected not to successfully reproduce
        itself. If adventures in policy recommendation then follow, they are
        strictly secondly. What is primary is simple. Reality rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Outside in</em> is, of course, utterly Social Darwinist in this
        sense (and probably also in whatever others are available).
        Variation-selection dynamics are unsurpassable. Whatever seeks to depart
        from them will fail. Suppression of either variation or selection is
        intrinsically maladaptive <em>to the cosmos</em>. Maximization of the
        interlocked functions of experimentation and eradication of error is the
        only value to which the ultimate nature of things subscribes. Anything
        that works picks up on that, and goes with its grain. Anything that
        doesn’t is objectively insane. It’s not especially difficult, except for
        the fact that it offers us nothing but the (cold) truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does Darwinism define the ultimate (transcendental) Right (in
        <a href="https://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/neoreaction-is-always-to-your-right/">this</a>
        sense, and
        <a href="https://poseidonawoke.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/culture-of-neoreaction/">this</a>)? Capitalism as
        Darwinian socio-economics, HBD as Darwinian
        anthropology, the
        <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/gods.html">Gods</a> of
        the Copybook Headings as Darwinian cultural history …? I cannot even
        imagine how that might not be so.

        From a widely cited
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/">defense</a>
        of the Black Lives Matter synthetic meme at <em>Reddit</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… societally, we <strong>don’t</strong> pay as much attention to
          certain people’s deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don’t
          treat all lives as though they matter equally.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Two points:<br />
        (1) Some lives (and deaths) <em>do</em> matter far more than others,
        <strong>obviously</strong>. Everyone knows this, when they’re not high,
        even if they usually feel compelled to lie about it. (Some lives,
        indeed, characterized by criminality and parasitism, are worth less than
        nothing — and even considerably less.) Only bizarre religious ideas
        could lead anybody to think the opposite.<br />
        (2) Western societies are very rapidly losing the ability to make sane
        calls on the point, as <em>exceptional productivity</em> loses its
        capacity to inspire attention, and the merely <em>piteous</em> usurps
        its central cultural position.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of adaptive sensibilities, life insurance premiums — or
        some equivalent expression of undemonstrative, practical
        value-processing — will have to serve as a default.

          biological motivation for this behaviour. When a queen mole rat’s

          oestrogen boost causes the beta rats to take care of the queen’s pups

          one queen rat and a few males that can reproduce. The rest of the

          tasks such as foraging and defending the nest. The subordinate rats
          also take care of the queen’s pups as though the babies were their

        <h4 class="post-title">Twin Discoveries</h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        Twin studies are the foundation of realism in all subjects pertaining to
        human beings (although their implications are wider). They reveal two
        crucial pieces of information:<br />
        (1) Heredity overwhelms environment in the (rigorous, statistical)
        explanation of human psychology, and<br />
        (2) Humans are massively predisposed to under-emphasize hereditary
        factors in the folk explanation of human psychology (including their
        own).
      </p>
      <p>
        Both points emerge lucidly from Brian Boutwell’s
        <a
          href="http://quillette.com/2015/12/01/why-parenting-may-not-matter-and-why-most-social-science-research-is-probably-wrong/">article</a>
        on twin research in <em>Quillette</em>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Based on the results of classical twin studies, it just doesn’t
          appear that parenting — whether mom and dad are permissive or not,
          read to their kid or not, or whatever else — impacts development as
          much as we might like to think. Regarding the cross-validation that I
          mentioned, studies examining identical twins separated at birth and
          reared apart have repeatedly revealed (in shocking ways) the same
          thing: these individuals are remarkably similar when in fact they
          should be utterly different (they have completely different
          environments, but the same genes). Alternatively, non-biologically
          related adopted children (who have no genetic commonalities) raised
          together are utterly dissimilar to each other — despite in many cases
          having decades of exposure to the same parents and home
          environments.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without wanting to play down the importance of the parenting angle, it’s
        worth bearing in mind that this is a rare zone where it remains
        politically acceptable to bring hereditarian findings to the table.
        Upsetting parents is still OK, and even vaguely commendable, so it
        provides a doorway through which to introduce matters of far broader
        significance. The truly critical point, from the perspective of this
        blog, is that
        <em>we should expect a systematic cognitive bias against the influence of
          heredity</em>
        and thus — intellectual integrity demands — we should lean against it.
      </p>
      <p>There’s an important lesson here:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Children who are spanked (not abused, but spanked) often experience a
          host of other problems in life, including psychological maladjustment
          and behavioral problems. In a study led by my colleague J.C. Barnes,
          we probed this issue in more detail and found some evidence suggesting
          that spanking increased the occurrence of overt bad behavior in
          children. We could have stopped there. Yet, we went one step further
          and attempted to inspect the genetic influences that were rampant
          across the measures included in our study. What we found was that much
          of the association between the two variables (spanking and behavior)
          was attributable to genetic effects that they had in common. The
          correlation between spanking and behavior appeared to reflect the
          presence of shared genetic influences cutting across both traits.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents are twin sources of influence. They “pass along two things to
        their kids: genes <em>and</em> an environment” — which facilitates the
        misattribution of genetic to environmental factors. If you find yourself
        regularly spanking your kids, it’s very likely that you’ve
        genetically-endowed them with the same spank-worthy characteristics you
        have yourself (because you were spanked as a kid, too, right?). The
        environmentalist delusion practically leaps out of this situation,
        pre-packaged for credulous belief.

      <p>
        It is surely a crucial (and inadequately acknowledged) feature of
        Darwin’s <em>The Origin of Species</em> that its point of departure is
        <em>artificial selection</em>, which might also be described as
        primordial technology, or the foundation of material civilization.
        Natural selection acquires definition through comparison with the
        (predominantly <em>unconscious</em>) process of domestication, or
        <em>cultivation</em>. This is the transitional paragraph (from Chapter
        IV):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his
          methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural
          selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters:
          Nature, if I many be allowed to personify the natural preservation or
          survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so
          far as they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal
          organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole
          machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good: Nature only for
          that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully
          exercised by her, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man
          keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom
          exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner;
          he feeds a long- and short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not
          exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar
          manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate.
          He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females.
          He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during
          each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions.
          He often begins his selection from some half-monstrous form; or at
          least by some modification prominent enough to catch the eye or to be
          plainly useful to him. Under Nature, the slightest difference of
          structure or constitution may well turn the nicely balanced scale in
          the struggle for life, and so be preserved. How fleeting are the
          wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how
          poor will be his results, compared with those accumulated by Nature
          during whole geological periods! Can we wonder, then, that Natures
          productions should be far “truer” in character than man’s productions;
          that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex
          conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher
          workmanship?</em>

          It’s open about the skew: “All the major and many of the minor living

          have gone extinct are shown.”
        </p>

          Extinction is overwhelmingly the deep reality, compared to which the

          more than a rounding error. Through a reflexive, lucid, secondary
          selection the culled, blasted, and gnawed tree of terrestrial life is
          edited into the attractive flowering shrub we see in the diagram. It

          <h4 class="post-title">Hell-Baked</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          There’s a potential prologue to this post that I’m reluctant to be
          distracted by. It’s introvertedly about NRx, as a cultural mutation, and
          the way this is defined by a strategic — or merely ornery — indifference
          to deeply-settled modes of ethico-political condemnation. Terms designed
          as pathblockers — ‘fascist’ or ‘racist’ most obviously — are stepped
          over, perhaps laughed at, but in any case, and most importantly,
          <em>exposed</em> as bearers of a <em>religious terror</em>. They are
          signs of a control regime, marking the unthinkable wastes
          <em>where be dragons</em>, effective precisely insofar as they cannot be
          entertained. ‘Satanic’ was once such a word (before it became a joke).
          These words cannot be understood except as invocations of the sacred, in
          its negative, or limitative role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is NRx in fact fascist? Not remotely. It is probably, in reality rather
          than self-estimation, the <em>least</em> fascistic current of political
          philosophy presently in existence, although this requires a minimal
          comprehension of what fascism actually is, which the word itself in its
          contemporary usage is designed to obstruct. Is NRx racist? Probably. The
          term is so entirely plastic in the service of those who utilize it that
          it is difficult, with any real clarity, to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          What NRx most definitely is, at least in the firm opinion of this blog,
          is <em>Social Darwinist</em>. When this term is hurled at NRx as a
          negative epithet, it is nor a cause for stoic resignation, stiffened by
          humor, but rather for grim delight. Of course, this term is culturally
          processed — <em>thought through</em> — no more competently than those
          previously noted. It is our task to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-5370"></span>If ‘Social Darwinism’ is in any way an
          unfortunate term, it is only because it is merely Darwinism, and more
          exactly <em>consistent Darwinism</em>. It is equivalent to the
          proposition that Darwinian processes have no limits relevant to us.
          Darwinism is something we are inside. No part of what it is to be human
          can ever judge its Darwinian inheritance from a position of transcendent
          leverage, as if accessing principles of moral estimation with some
          alternative genesis, or criterion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is easy to say. As far as this blog is concerned, it is also —
          beyond all reasonable question — true. While very far from a dominant
          global opinion, it is not uncommonly held — if only nominally — by a
          considerable fraction of those among the educated segment of the world’s
          high-IQ populations. It is also, however, scarcely bearable to think.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logical consequence of Social Darwinism is that
          <strong>everything of value has been built in Hell</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only due to a predominance of influences that are not only
          entirely morally indifferent, but indeed — from a human perspective —
          indescribably cruel, that nature has been capable of constructive
          action. Specifically, it is solely by way of the relentless, brutal
          culling of populations that any complex or adaptive traits have been
          sieved — with torturous inefficiency — from the chaos of natural
          existence. All health, beauty, intelligence, and social grace has been
          teased from a vast butcher’s yard of unbounded carnage, requiring
          incalculable eons of massacre to draw forth even the subtlest of
          advantages. This is not only a matter of the bloody grinding mills of
          selection, either, but also of the innumerable mutational abominations
          thrown up by the madness of chance, as it pursues its directionless path
          to some negligible preservable trait, and then — still further — of the
          unavowable horrors that ‘fitness’ (or sheer survival) itself
          predominantly entails. We are a minuscule sample of agonized matter,
          comprising genetic survival monsters, fished from a cosmic ocean of vile
          mutants, by a pitiless killing machine of infinite appetite. (This is
          still, perhaps, to put an irresponsibly positive spin on the story, but
          it should suffice for our purposes here.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, any attempt to escape this fatality — or, more realistically,
          any mere accidental and temporary reprieve from it — leads inexorably to
          the undoing of its work. <em>Malthusian relaxation</em> is the whole of
          mercy, and it is the greatest engine of destruction our universe is able
          to bring about. To the precise extent that we are spared, even for a
          moment, we degenerate — and this Iron Law applies to every dimension and
          scale of existence: phylogenetic and ontogenetic, individual, social,
          and institutional, genomic, cellular, organic, and cultural. There is no
          machinery extant, or even rigorously imaginable, that can sustain a
          single iota of attained value outside the forges of Hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is it that Neoreaction — perhaps I should say
          <em>The Dark Enlightenment</em> — has to offer the world, if all goes
          optimally (which, of course, it won’t)? Really, the honest answer to
          this question is: <em>Eternal Hell</em>. It’s not an easy marketing
          brief. We could perhaps try:
          <em>But it could be worse (and almost certainly will be)</em>.

          That’s mostly because scarcely anyone owns anything:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… it does not take that much to get into the top 1% of wealth
            holders. Once debts have been subtracted, a person needs only $3,650
            to be among the wealthiest half of the world’s citizens. However,
            about $77,000 is required to be a member of the top 10% of global
            wealth holders and $798,000 to belong to the top 1%. So if you own a
            home in any major city in the rich North on your own and without a
            mortgage, you are part of the top 1%.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This looks like what you’d expect if population — at the global level —
          expanded approximately to the resource limit. (There are no doubt
          cuddlier interpretations out there.)

          question, at least. The sole real puzzle is the precise quantity of
          dysgenic deterioration that has taken place in Western societies over
          the last 150 years, or more. Charlton estimates a one SD decline over
          this period in the UK, which seems entirely credible. Due to the small

          <a href="http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/outliers/">ADDED</a>:
          Gregory Cochran’s ‘outliers’ argument against this thesis has as its
          core: “In another application – if the average genetic IQ potential had
          decreased by a standard deviation since Victorian times, the number of
          individuals with the ability to develop new, difficult, and interesting
          results in higher mathematics would have crashed, bring such
          developments to a screeching halt. Of course that has not happened.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have found it profoundly confidence-crushing if Cochran had
          simply said:
          <em>the collapse of a complex trait on this scale, in this time-span, is
            inconsistent with everything we know about population genetics</em>. The argument he relies upon instead,
          while
          far more elegant, is also
          much less persuasive (see the excellent comment thread at his site). As
          Dave Chamberlin
          <a href="http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/outliers/#comment-22999">notes</a>, the parallel increase in
          assortative mating over the period in
          question means that assuming a stable standard distribution (variance)
          might not be safe. An increasingly heterogeneous population would to
          some degree shield its outliers from averaging effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to the evidence mustered in support of the IQ collapse thesis,
          it is hard to be impressed by the rather impressionistic claim “Of
          course that has not happened.” Up to the mid-20th century — the era of
          Gödel, Von Neumann, and Turing — this might indeed have been
          irresistible, but today? Charlton’s counter-argument seems by no means
          risible. How sure are we that mathematics has not “collapsed” — at least
          down to the level of ‘normal’ (rather than ‘revolutionary’) science?
          What was the last mathematical break-through that mattered dazzlingly to
          the world?

          Ching’s recent
          <a

          comparing the economic performance of the earth’s two demographic giants
          was given the tantalizing headline
          <em>Why India Keeps Falling Behind China</em>. There’s no sign of the
          “Why?” at the original, published in Taiwan’s <em>China Post</em>. No
          surprise there.
        </p>
        <p>As Ching notes:</p>
        <p>
          <em>While India and China are both being hailed as rapidly developing
            emerging markets, the gap between the two countries is widening with
            India being left behind as China continues to power ahead. China’s
            growth in 2013 was 7.7 percent while that of India hit a low for the
            decade of 4.5 percent in the 2012-13 fiscal year.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being positioned for catch-up (i.e. being far poorer), India
          simply doesn’t
          <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/9743.html">grow</a> as fast
          as China. “The average estimated productivity growth rate of China
          (5.9%) is more than double that of India (2.4%).” India hasn’t matched
          Chinese growth rates in any single year since the end of the Mao-era in
          the late 1970s, even after launching its own much-heralded
          market-oriented economic reform program in the early 1990s. Despite
          pulling itself from the dismal 3% “Hindu” growth rate, which was roughly
          doubled to a 5-6% range, China’s average 9.8% growth rate, sustained
          over three decades, has remained far out of reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-2326"></span>The two most populous nations on earth — by
          a huge margin — accounting between them for over a third of the
          ‘developing world’ by headcount (and for a far larger proportion of the
          part that has been in any serious way developing), would seem,
          superficially, like obvious candidates for unrelenting comparison. How
          could this titanic development race not be the most important
          socio-economic story on the planet?
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding drama to this competition is the ideological polarity it
          represents. Pitting the most substantial and obstreperous antagonist to
          liberal-democratic global manifest destiny against a regime that was
          forged in Fabian social-democracy, and which continues to exult in its
          status as “the world’s largest democracy®” — the narrative potential is
          … oh wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the forces of darkness, it only gets better. If India’s relative
          development failure is not to be considered a conspicuous illustration
          of democratic incapability, other explanatory factors have to be
          invoked. Something like 5% GDP growth is going missing, chronically,
          every year (and if alternative development indicators are preferred, the
          grim story they tell is much the same). Either India’s
          Cathedral-approved political orientation is responsible for this social
          morass, or something
          <a
            href="http://www.rlynn.co.uk/uploads/pdfs/Intelligence%20and%20the%20Wealth%20and%20Poverty%20of%20Nations.pdf">else</a>
          has to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          While wondering about this awkward conundrum, you’re quite likely to
          stop being surprised about the paucity of China-India comparative news
          coverage. Clearly, the “Why?” isn’t wanted, because it only goes to bad
          places. In fact, it’s probably the worst question in the world.

          Michael A. Woodley, Jan te Nijenhuis, and Raegan Murphy
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3c4TxciNeJZN29lSlpmdmlOcVE/edit">respond</a>
          (in detail) to critics of their 2013 paper on the dysgenic implications
          of Galton’s reaction time data. Their adjusted evidence indicates an
          increase in reaction times among US/UK males over the period 1889-2004
          from 187.1 ms to 237.1 ms (44.6 ms over 115 years), equivalent to a
          decline in <em>g</em> of 13.9 points, or 1.21 points per decade. They
          propose that 68% of this decline is due to dysgenic selection, with the
          remaining 32% attributed to increasing mutation load.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these figures are even remotely accurate, they portray a phenomenon —
          and indeed a catastrophe — that would have to be considered a
          fundamental determinant of recent world history. Given the scale and
          rapidity of dysgenic collapse suggested here, skepticism is natural, and
          indeed all-but inevitable. (The proposed rate of decline seems
          incredible to this, radically inexpert, blog.) It should nevertheless be
          reasonable to expect counter-arguments to exhibit the same intellectual
          seriousness and respect for evidence that this paper so impressively
          demonstrates.

          Of Heartiste’s six proposed policy responses, #2 (introduce
          counter-dysgenic incentives) is the only one this blog endorse without
          reservation. High-IQ immigration, assortative mating, and open markets
          all make a positive contribution to general social competitiveness,
          although due theoretical deference to
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/iq-shredders/">IQ-Shredder</a>
          problems is required. His point #6 is valuable if it is inverted, to
          make socio-political fragmentation a primary objective, rather than a
          consequence, or subordinate instrumental goal. Point #5 (“Eliminate all
          female-friendly public policies”) is unobjectionable because all
          ‘X-friendly’ public policies are objectionable, and its specific
          emphasis is material for consideration within a disintegrated
          <em>oecumenon</em>, where polities could experiment with all kinds of
          things. Talented people will tend to flee a heavy-handed authoritarian
          state, even if it’s social policies have impressive traditional
          validation. Consequently, as a response to local dysgenics, the outcome
          of any attempt to socially engineer a restored patriarchy from the
          top-down is likely to be counter-productive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social Darwinism, seriously understood, is the theoretical default that
          every attempt to neutralize spontaneous selection processes (entropy
          dissipation) will be subverted by predictable perverse effects. It’s no
          more possible to suppress Social Darwinism than it is to annul the
          Second Law of Thermodynamics, and social philosophies which teach that
          this can be achieved are the strict equivalent of plans for perpetual
          motion machines. That’s what Weiss is explaining, as
          <em>Outside in</em> understands it. Subsumption into an effective
          competitive environment is the only possible response that could work to
          reverse dysgenic trends, and this will eventually occur, whether human
          politics cooperates or not. Patchwork is the gentlest way this could be
          realized, since it enables a multitude of societies to decide on their
          own levels of entropy-accumulation tolerance. (That is not, of course,
          to suggest that a Patchworked-world is gentle in any sense we have grown
          accustomed to.)

          The level of apocalypticism to be found in scientific abstracts rarely
          reaches the Dark Enlightenment threshold, but there are always
          exceptions. Here’s Olav Albert Christophersen, on ‘Thematic Cluster:
          Focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder’, originally published in
          <em>Microbial Ecology in Health &amp; Disease</em> (2012). Indicatively,
          the
          <a href="http://www.microbecolhealthdis.net/index.php/mehd/article/view/19008/23916">paper</a>
          is subtitled ‘Should autism be considered a canary bird telling that
          <em>Homo sapiens</em> may be on its way to extinction?’ The full
          abstract:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There has been a dramatic enhancement of the reported incidence of
            autism in different parts of the world over the last 30 years. This
            can apparently not be explained only as a result of improved diagnosis
            and reporting, but may also reflect a real change. The causes of this
            change are unknown, but if we shall follow T.C. Chamberlin’s principle
            of multiple working hypotheses, we need to take into consideration the
            possibility that it partly may reflect an enhancement of the average
            frequency of responsible alleles in large populations. If this
            hypothesis is correct, it means that the average germline mutation
            rate must now be much higher in the populations concerned, compared
            with the natural mutation rate in hominid ancestors before the
            agricultural and industrial revolutions. This is compatible with the
            high prevalence of impaired human semen quality in several countries
            and also with what is known about high levels of total exposure to
            several different unnatural chemical mutagens, plus some natural ones
            at unnaturally high levels. Moreover, dietary deficiency conditions
            that may lead to enhancement of mutation rates are also very
            widespread, affecting billions of people. However,
            <strong>the natural mutation rate in hominids has been found to be so high
              that there is apparently no tolerance for further enhancement of the
              germline mutation rate before the Eigen error threshold will be
              exceeded and our species will go extinct because of mutational
              meltdown</strong>. This threat, if real, should be considered far more serious than
            any disease causing the death only of individual patients.
            <strong>It should therefore be considered the first and highest priority of
              the best biomedical scientists in the world, of research-funding
              agencies and of all medical doctors to try to stop the express train
              carrying all humankind as passengers on board before it arrives at
              the end station of our civilization</strong>.</em>

          <em>The clearest takeaway from this research is that low intelligence is
            a strong and consistent correlate of criminal offending. For example,
            the risk of acquiring a felony conviction by age 21 is nearly four
            times (3.6) higher among those in the three lowest categories (1–3) of
            total intelligence as compared to those scoring in the top three
            categories (7–9). We observed differences of similar magnitude across

          <em>Galton feared that the English race was degenerating, declining in
            both mental and physical ability. (It remains a common fear; the
            French thought they were degenerating, too.) Like others of his day,
            Galton used the term ‘race’ loosely. He referred alternately to the
            English race, the white race, the human race. But overall, English
            eugenics was less about race than class. To Galton’s mind, the filthy
            working poor were breeding like rabbits while the gentry were chastely
            dwindling. He became convinced that unless something were done, the
            flower of English manhood – not excluding specimens such as his cousin
            and, ahem, himself – would soon vanish, swamped by a massive tide of

          Gregory Clark’s latest
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Son-Also-Rises-Princeton/dp/0691162549">book</a>
          <em>The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility</em>
          at <em>American Renaissance</em>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>China, which saw enormous social upheaval in the 20th century,
            provides yet another perspective. Under Mao, much of the country’s
            elite was killed or exiled. The rest were subject to discrimination
            and excluded from the Communist Party. During the Cultural Revolution,
            Mao tried to turn the social scale upside down by shipping prominent
            people to the countryside to work in rice paddies. If political
            intervention can create higher social mobility, it would have done so
            in China.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Yet once discrimination against “class enemies” was abolished shortly
            after Mao’s death, those with surnames characteristic of the
            pre-communist elite quickly began to rise again. Today, they are
            greatly over-represented even in the Communist Party. Those descended
            from the “workers and peasants” favored under Mao have quickly seen
            their status erode. Recent social mobility in China has been no
            greater than it was under the Emperors.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who doesn’t find their presuppositions shaken by Clark’s work is
          probably not paying attention. If those out here in the NRx think it
          conforms neatly to their expectations that heredity is strongly
          determining of social outcomes — are they comfortable proceeding to
          evidence-based acknowledgement that socio-economic regime-type seems
          entirely irrelevant to the (uniformly low) level of social mobility?
          Clark himself draws the curve-ball conclusion:
          <em>so why not be a social democrat? It’s not as if rational incentives
            make any difference anyway</em>.

            href="http://shanghaiist.com/2014/04/19/interview-leta-hong-fincher-leftover-women-part-2.php">interview</a>
          with Leta Hong Fincher wanders into<del> inspiring</del> delicate
          territory:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… in 2007, China’s State Council came out with a very important
            population decision. They announced that China had a severe problem
            with the so-called “low quality” of the population, that it’s going to
            cause problems for China in the future, in the global marketplace,
            that it’s going to affect China’s ability to compete with other
            nations, because the quality of the population is too low. So they
            made it an urgent priority to “upgrade population quality” (<strong>tigao renkou suzhi</strong>). And then
            they
            designated certain agencies to be the primary
            implementers of the goal of upgrading population quality. One of the
            agencies they named was the Women’s Federation. And they also named
            the Public Security Bureau. Shortly after that population decision,
            the state media suddenly came out with all these Leftover Women media
            reports, news reports cartoons, commentaries, columns, and it was just
            ubiquitous.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And then, the Women’s Federation defined the term and the Ministry of
            Education adopted the term <strong>shengnü</strong> [or ‘leftover
            woman’] as part of its official lexicon. And it’s just amazing when
            you look at these reports and cartoons just how little they vary.
            Fundamentally it’s the same message, kind of reworded. It’s the same
            theme over and over again, year after year.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-2562"></span><em>The basic message is targeting urban, educated, successful,
            professional women. And it shows these women as being too picky.
            They’re too focused on their careers. They’re overly ambitious. If
            they simply lowered their sights, and made more compromises, then they
            would easily find a man to marry. So it’s the woman’s fault that they
            are not getting married, that their standards are too high. And then
            there are a wide variety of insults hurled at these women: that they
            don’t like sex, that they’re afraid of commitment.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And I noticed that they are evolving. The propaganda machine is
            evolving now to include single, divorced mothers. Just a few months
            ago, I noticed Xinhua News came out with something talking about how
            single, divorced mothers also have an obligation to go out and get
            married again and that they shouldn’t use their children as an excuse
            not to get married. They also have a new category of so-called
            leftover women which is single female homeowners. They say that single
            women lull themselves into a false sense of security by buying a home
            of their own. In fact this is going to make it even more difficult for
            them to find a husband.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>All of this is really tightening its hold on this group of urban,
            educated, professional women. And why are they focusing on these
            women? It’s because these women have, in the view of the government,
            higher quality. The government has a tradition of eugenics. These
            educated urban women are seen as having higher quality, but these are
            the very women who are choosing to delay marriage because they want to
            pursue their educations, because they want to pursue their careers.
            It’s a very natural thing to do and that’s what women around China are
            doing. In South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and even Hong Kong,
            women are delaying their age of first marriage and some of them are
            even rejecting marriage altogether.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And so the Chinese government feels this urgency, I believe, that
            they need to stop this trend. They have to get these educated women to
            get married and have a child because they see this as the basic
            function of a woman. Her duty to the nation is to have a child. But
            they are focusing on educated women. They’re not encouraging the
            illiterate rural woman to have children, because those women are
            considered to be of “low quality”.</em>

          This elementary common sense is supposed to be appalling beyond
          comprehension, of course.

          <h4 class="post-title">Hyper-Racism</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          While this blog generally seeks to spread dismay whenever the
          opportunity arises, it cannot pretend to a huge obsession with what
          might be described as <em>ordinary racism</em>. When perusing the
          thought-crimes of the mainstream racist community, it is continually
          afflicted by a sense of overwhelming unreality. This is not (of course),
          because races do not
          <a
            href="http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-confusion-in-scientific-study-of.html">exist</a>,
          or do not differ significantly, or … whatever. The most politically
          incorrect cognitive position on almost every point of this kind is
          reliably closer to reality than its more socially-convenient and
          comforting alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with ordinary racism is its utter incomprehension of the
          near future. Not only will capabilities for genomic manipulation
          dissolve biological identity into techno-commercial processes of
          yet-incomprehensible radicality, but also … other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, a sketch of the existing racism-antiracism contention in its
          commonplace or dominant form. The antiracist, or universal humanist
          position — when extracted from its most idiotic social-constructivist
          and hypocritical alt-racist expressions — amounts to a program for
          global genetic pooling. Cultural barriers to the Utopian vision of a
          unitary ‘human’ gene pool, stirred with increasing ardor into
          homogeneous intermixture, are deplored as atavistic obstructions to the
          realization of a true, common humanity. Races <em>will not</em> exist
          once they are reduced, by practical politics and libidinal
          indiscriminacy, into relics of contingent historical partition. In
          contrast, racial identitarianism envisages a conservation of
          (comparative) genetic isolation, generally determined by boundaries
          corresponding to conspicuous phenotypic variation. It is

          <a href="http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/the-first-men-in-the-moon/">suggests</a>
          that space colonization will inevitably function as a highly-selective
          genetic filter, unless extreme political intervention is taken to
          prevent this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>One generally assumes that space colonists, assuming that there ever
            are any, will be picked individuals, somewhat like existing astronauts
            – the best out of hordes of applicants. They’ll be smarter than
            average, healthier than average, saner than average – and not by just
            a little. […] Since all these traits are significantly heritable, some
            highly so, we have to expect that their descendants will be different
            – different above the neck. They’d likely be, on average, smarter than
            any existing ethnic group. If a Lunar colony really took off, early
            colonists might account for a disproportionate fraction of the
            population (just as Puritans do in the US), and the Loonies might
            continue to have inordinate amounts of the right stuff
            indefinitely</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a scientific sort, Cochran is exploring this scenario as a potential
          source of compelling hereditarian <em>evidence</em> (anticipated through
          <em>thought experiment</em>). What, however, of the prospect itself, as
          the illustration of a mechanism that lends itself to theoretical
          generalization? One might discuss it in terms of ordinary racism, as a
          zone of disparate impact (which it would almost certainly be). Yet this
          is only to scratch at it, hazily and superficially.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most prominent model of such a filter is found in the theory of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating">assortative</a>
          mating. Strictly speaking, the racial-preservationist culture advocated
          by ordinary racism is an example of assortative mating, with a criterion
          of genetic proximity filtering potential matches. This is not why the
          idea has such
          <a
            href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/372038/yes-assortative-mating-helps-explain-higher-inequality-patrick-brennan">currency</a>.
          It is assortative mating on the basis of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status">SES</a> that
          has lifted it to prominence, both because it seems unquestionably to be
          <a
            href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/02/the-very-best-coverage-of-the-new-charles-murray-book.html">happening</a>,
          and because the implications of its happening are
          <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001790.html">extreme</a>.
          (Crucially, SES is a strong proxy for IQ.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Assortative mating tends to genetic diversification. This is neither the
          preserved diversity of ordinary racism, still less the idealized genetic
          pooling of the anti-racists, but a class-structured mechanism for
          population diremption, on a vector towards neo-speciation. It implies
          the disintegration of the human species, along largely unprecedented
          lines, with intrinsic hierarchical consequence. The genetically
          self-filtering elite is not merely different — and becoming ever more
          different — it is explicitly <em>superior</em> according to the
          established criteria that allocate social status. Analogical fusion with
          Cochran’s space colonists is scarcely avoidable. If SES-based
          assortative mating is taking place, humanity (and not only society) is
          coming apart, on an axis whose inferior pole is <em>refuse</em>. This is
          not anything that ordinary racism is remotely able to process. That it
          is a consummate nightmare for anti-racism goes without question, but it
          is also trans-racial, infra-racial, and hyper-racial in ways that leave
          ‘race politics’ as a gibbering ruin in its wake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neo-eugenic genomic manipulation capabilities, which will also be
          unevenly distributed by SES, will certainly intensify the trend to
          speciation, rather than ameliorating it. On the sweetness-and-light
          side, racists and anti-racists can be expected to eventually bond in a
          defensive fraternity, when they recognize that
          traditionally-differentiated human populations are being torn asunder on
          an axis of variation that dwarfs all of their established concerns.

        </a>
        <p>
          Meta-stereotypes are not to be trusted.
          <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201210/stereotype-inaccuracy">This</a>
          is two years old, but recently tweet-linked by Justine
          <a href="https://twitter.com/JustineTunney">Tunney</a>, and well-worth
          recalling. The meat and potatoes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… stereotypes are not inaccurate. There are many different ways to
            test for the accuracy of stereotypes, because there are many different
            types or aspects of accuracy. However, one type is quite simple — the
            correspondence of stereotype beliefs with criteria. If I believe 60%
            of adult women are over 5′ 4″ tall, and 56% voted for the Democrat in
            the last Presidential election, and that 35% of all adult women have
            college degrees, how well do my beliefs correspond to the actual
            probabilities? One can do this sort of thing for many different types
            of groups.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>And lots of scientists have. And you know what they found? That
            stereotype accuracy — the correspondence of stereotype beliefs with
            criteria — is one of the largest relationships in all of social
            psychology. The correlations of stereotypes with criteria range from
            .4 to over .9, and average almost .8 for cultural stereotypes (the
            correlation of beliefs that are widely shared with criteria) and.5 for
            personal stereotypes (the correlation of one individual’s stereotypes
            with criteria, averaged over lots of individuals). The average effect
            in social psychology is about .20. Stereotypes are more valid than
            most social psychological hypotheses.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not as if this is
          <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/HumanSciences/stereotypes.html">new</a>, or in general outline
          even two years old. It’s roughly as old as
          human culture, in fact. Generalization is what pragmatic intelligence is
          for (which means it’s what intelligence in general has been kept around
          for). Regardless of where we find ourselves culturally right now, this
          is a point of common sense that simply can’t be forgotten forever.

          There’s an exchange in Sam Raimi’s
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623205/">movie</a>
          <em>Oz the Great and Powerful</em>, where the fake wizard, speculating
          on the incentives for success, says to his monkey(ish) companion and
          servant Finley:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>“We’re going to find this wicked witch. Steal her wand. I’ll get that
            big pile of gold. And you can have a nice pile of bananas,
            alright?”<br />
            “Bananas. Oh, I see, because I’m a monkey? I must love bananas, right?
            — That is a vicious stereotype.”<br />
            “You don’t like bananas?”<br />
            “Of course I love bananas. I’m a monkey. Don’t be ridiculous. I just
            don’t like you saying it …”</em>

          probably from a more reputable source.)

          <em>I believe these people are stupidest and most dangerous people on the

          <span id="more-1624"></span>There’s a comment from me pending at TC, and
          I’ve lost patience, so here it is (one word edited):
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There’s absolutely no reason to think that the “HBD OMG! Auschwitz!”
            crowd here is receptive to logical argument, but what the hell — It
            goes like this:</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Under the present Progressive dispensation, wherever group
            differences are detected in social outcomes, the dominant
            presupposition is that a grave social injustice has been identified.
            Not many women, blacks, or hispanics to be found as programmers in
            Silicon Valley companies? — obvious evil at work. The solution: new
            bureaucratic arrangements, indoctrination sessions, intensified
            ideological reconstruction of the education system, anti-rightist
            campaigns (the beatings will continue until ‘fairness’ arrives).
            Protest any of this, and full-spectrum social destruction will be
            orchestrated.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>HBD and its associated ideas propose — on the basis of abundant
            empirical evidence and theoretical understanding — that the existence
            of deeply ingrained group differences, both biological and cultural,
            actually predict disparate social outcomes. Men and women, on average,
            are attracted to different professions, in keeping with their natural
            competences. The same applies to ethnic and racial groups. It makes no
            more sense to see a vicious racist conspiracy in the domination of
            sprinting by people of African ancestry than to see the same in the
            preponderance of Jews, East Asians, and Caucasians among mathematics
            professors. If this seems implausible to you, feel free to argue about
            it — there are rigorous research programs dedicated to
            <del>researching</del> examining such realities (even under
            contemporary Lysenkoist conditions).
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The first-order consequence of HBD, therefore, is not to start
            organizing the cattle trucks to death camps, but in fact to — relax.
            People are different. They thrive at different things. No government
            is capable of comprehending optimal outcomes in detail (or even broad
            outline). Society’s spontaneous sorting mechanisms do a pretty good
            job at dealing with the situation, when left alone to do so, and
            certainly no superior arrangement presents itself. Best of all, you
            don’t even need to pull your jackboots on to let things work. So chill
            (except that’s increasingly illegal).</em>

            cognition and communication skills. Presumably, these attributes would
            have conferred advantages to some individuals, perhaps in terms of
            enhanced foraging skills or increased social skills, leading to
            increased opportunities for access to food or mating … These
            individuals would have then potentially had increased survival and
            fitness, traits that would have become increasingly selected upon

          the Great. Today I’m seeing his stuff mentioned all over the place (at
          least, by Bryce on Twitter, and Scott Alexander
          <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/17/someone-writes-an-anti-racist-faq">at</a>

          being especially recommended share a tack (interesting) and a tone
          (impressive). The <em>Outside in</em> response to both is unsettled, but
          already uneven. At the very least, they initiate a conversation in a way
          that is unexpected and worthy of respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The highlight for me was
          <a href="www.skepticink.com/prussian/2014/03/31/the-anti-racialist-q-a/">this</a>
          (to repeat the second link):
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… when differences in African and Caucasian distributions of the ASPM
            gene that is involved in brain development, racialists jumped to argue
            that this was the long looked for basis for white cognitive supremacy
            (Derbyshire’s line). Unfortunately for them, it turned out that the
            variation does not affect IQ, but does
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1904158/">affect the ability to hear tones, and is
              associated with a lack of
              tonal languages</a>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To be honest, this is a lot more interesting than any IQ mumbo-jumbo;
            that Indo-European languages (‘Aryan’ languages to use the term
            correctly, and not in the disgraceful way it was used) are non-tonal
            is one of the big puzzles, and may be a reason why civilization got
            started in these regions. This is a variant of Joseph Needham’s
            hypothesis of why China ‘got stuck’ at a certain level of technology.
            Needham argued that the Chinese failed to make the break to the
            conceptual level of science that the ancient Greeks did, and part of
            this is to do with the concrete-level of Chinese vocabulary. By
            contrast, the reduced sound range and hence, reduced word range
            available to Indo-European languages may have played a crucial role in
            making that initial great breakthrough.</em>

          Has the case just been made for a clearly identifiable genetic

            oil-refining Caribbean country of Trinidad and Tobago, which is
            roughly evenly divided between blacks and South Asians. African

          <a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/dan-freedmans-babies/">Retrieved</a>
          from four years ago (by XS’s favorite HBD-<a href="https://twitter.com/hbdchick">blogger</a>), and still
          perfect
          in its outrageous realism:
        </p>

          <em>Daniel Freedman was a professor of anthropology at the University of
            Chicago. For his doctoral thesis, he did adoption studies with dogs.
            He had noticed that different dog breeds had different personalities,
            and thought it would be interesting to see if personality was inborn,
            or if it was somehow caused by the way in which the mother raised her
            puppies. Totally inborn. Little beagles were irrepressibly friendly.
            Shetland sheepdogs were most sensitive to a loud voice or the
            slightest punishment. Wire-haired terriers were so tough and
            aggressive that Dan had to wear gloves when playing with puppies that
            were only three weeks old. Basenjis were aloof and independent.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>He decided to try the same thing with human infants of different
            breeds. Excuse me, different races. …</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll never guess what happens next (although, actually, the readers
          here are almost certain to).
        </p>
        <p>
          The dog-breed analogy is used quite often, but probably still not
          enough. It’s pitched at the correct cladistic level, obviously. In
          addition, since ‘labrador supremacism’ sounds immediately ridiculous it
          should contribute to chipping a little stupidity from the race
          discussion.

          Guilt is basically a North-West European thing,

          which has a claim to be the social fact of greatest significance in
          the world today. There’s a certain type of fanatically universalist
          moral argument that — even when encountered anonymously on the Internet
          — indicates (absolutely reliably) that one is dealing with a self-hating
          pale-face. When someone tells you that some incontestable principle
          requires self-sacrifice without reservation to the wretched global
          Other, the obvious melanin deficiency almost sucks holes in the screen.
          None of this is seriously controversial (although more hard data would,
          of course, be nice).
        </p>
        <p>
          Take one additional step, and hypothesize that the Cathedral latches
          onto white guilt as its sole natural territory. Much then follows.
          Clearly, whatever ‘globalization’ the Cathedral will ever achieve cannot
          be analogous to its domestic dominion. It is a plug that only fits the
          white guilt socket, so that every attempt to propagate it more widely
          encounters complexities. To a degree, this is initially masked by the
          fact that a racial revenge narrative sells well, even when its original
          moral axioms are entirely non-communicative. ‘Post-colonialism’ would
          therefore be expected to mark the limit of Cathedralist global contagion
          — a limit that has already been in large measure reached (or even
          exceeded). Nobody other than whites wants white guilt
          <em>for themselves</em>. Non-whites will, however, often be delighted
          that whites have white guilt, especially when this has metastasized to
          its self-abolitional phase, and this second reaction — under the
          specific conditions of ‘post-colonial / anti-racist discourse’ — is
          easily confused with the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the progressivism-guilt plug-socket arrangement doesn’t travel
          racially, than Cathedralist globalization has to fall back upon far
          cruder mechanisms of power — of the “Red Foreign Policy” type. The
          experience of the last decade suggests that, in doing so, it is no
          longer remotely playing to its own strengths. Democratic evangelism, at
          home and abroad, are two very different things. Bloody international
          disorder is strongly predicted as the complement of its domestic New
          Jerusalem.

          <h4 class="post-title">White Fright</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Racial fear is a complicated thing. It’s worth trying to break it down,
          without blinking too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one regresses through history, and into pre-history, the pattern of
          encounters between large-scale human groups of markedly distinct
          ancestry is modeled — with ever-greater fidelity — upon a genocidal
          ideal. The ‘other’ needs to be killed, or at the very least broken in
          its otherness. To butcher all males, beginning with those of military
          age, and then assimilate the females as breeding stock might suffice as
          a solution (Yahweh specifically warns the ancient Hebrews against such
          half-hearted measures). Anything less is sheer procrastination. When
          economic imperatives and high levels of civilizational confidence start
          to overwhelm more primordial considerations, it is possible for the
          suppression of other peoples to take the humanized form of social
          obliteration combined with mass enslavement, but such softness is a
          comparatively recent phenomenon. For almost the entire period in which
          recognizably ‘human’ animals have existed on this planet, racial
          difference has been thought sufficient motive for extermination, with
          limited contact and inadequacy of socio-technical means serving as the
          only significant brakes upon inter-racial violence. The sole
          deep-historical alternative to racial oppression has been racial
          eradication, except where geographical separation has postponed
          resolution. This is the simple side of the ‘race problem’, but it too
          begins to get complicated … (we’ll pick it up again after a detour).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the moment, we need only note the archaic, subterranean ocean of
          racial animosity that laps upon the sunless chasms of the brain,
          directed by genomes sculpted by aeons of genocidal war. Call it racial
          terror. It’s not our principal concern here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-2214"></span>Racial horror is something else, although it
          is no doubt intricately inter-connected. Horror of the very phenomenon
          of race — of <em>race as such</em> — is both a larger and a smaller
          topic. It is at once an expansive affect that finds no comfort in
          biological identity, and a distinctively ethno-specific syndrome. When
          positively elaborated, racial horror explodes into a ‘Lovecraftian’
          cosmic revulsion directed at the situation of human intelligence by its
          natural inheritance. The negative expression, far more common today
          (among those of a very specific natural inheritance), takes the form of
          a blank denial that any such reality as race even exists. We are fully
          entitled to describe this latter development as
          <em>racial white-out</em>. Any
          <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteness_studies">Critical</a>

          of even minimal seriousness would concentrate upon it unrelentingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/">HBD</a>, or human
          biological diversity, is evidently not reducible to racial variation. It
          is at least equally concerned with human sexual dimorphism, and is
          ultimately indistinguishable from an eventual
          <em>comparative human genomics</em>. When considered as a provocation,
          however, the translation of HBD into ‘race science’ or more pointedly
          ‘scientific racism’ drowns out every other dimension of meaning. What is
          found appalling about HBD is the insistence that race exists. It is a
          ‘trigger’ for racial horror. Social outrage, certainly, but beyond that
          cosmic distress, tilting into a panic without limit. HBD subtracts the
          promise of universal humanity, so it must — at any cost — be stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this is no more than a preliminary blog post, I will restrict it
          to a single modest ambition: the refoundation of Critical Whiteness
          Studies on a remorselessly Neoreactionary basis. White people are
          <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/the-dark-enlightenment-part-4c/">odd</a>. Some

          particular,
          have radically broken from the archaic pattern of
          human racial identity, creating the modern world in consequence, and
          within it their ethnic identity has become a dynamic paradox.
          <em>Whiteness</em> is an uncontrolled historical reaction which nobody —
          least of all anybody from among the complementary anti-racists of
          Critical Whiteness Studies and White Nationalism — has begun to
          understand. To begin to do so, one would have to comprehend why the
          <a href="http://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/11/22/why-i-am-not-a-white-nationalist/">essay</a>
          in which Mencius Moldbug most explicitly repudiates White Nationalism is
          the same as the one in which he most unambiguously endorses human racial
          diversity. It requires an acknowledgement of difficulty, which — because
          it demolishes irresistibly attractive but hopelessly facile solutions on
          both sides — few are motivated to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          The signature of indissoluble White difference is precisely racial
          horror. <strong>HBD is uniquely horrible to White people</strong>. Until
          you get that, you don’t get anything.

          Play with this for a while, or for more than a while (it does a huge
          amount of unwanted but indispensable work). To begin with:

          (1) Critical Whiteness Studies, whatever its ethno-minoritarian
          pretensions, is all about ‘acting white’. Insofar as it criticizes
          ‘white privilege’ <em>essentially</em>, it does so by reproducing an
          ethnically singular mode of universal reason which no other people make
          any sense of whatsoever, except opportunistically, and parasitically.
          ‘Whiteness’ tends to become a religious principle, exactly insofar as it
          lacks the recognizable characteristics of racial group dominance (“race
          does not exist”) and sublimes into a mode of cultural reproduction which
          only one ethnicity, ever, has manifested. To quote Alison Bailey —
          tilting over into the raw psychosis of systematic ‘whiteness’ critique

          <em>In its quest for certainty, Western philosophy continues to generate
            what it imagines to be colorless and genderless accounts of knowledge,
            reality, morality, and human nature. Perhaps this is because academic
            philosophy in the U.S. has been largely driven by analytic methods and
            the legacy of Classic Greek and European thinkers, or because
            philosophy departments are white social spaces where the overwhelming
            majority of professional philosophers are white men. In either case,
            it’s likely that most members of the discipline have avoided racial
            topics because they believe that philosophical thought transcends
            basic cultural, racial, ethnic, and social differences, and that these
            differences are best addressed by historians, cultural studies
            scholars, literary theorists, and social scientists. The absence of
            color talk in philosophy is a marker of its whiteness.</em>

          Supremacist white racism goes so deep it is absolutely indistinguishable
          from a complete absence of racism — <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em>.

          without white people, it would sweep the planet. (Try not to understand

            cleave so strongly to this secular religion that they are happy, nay
            overjoyed!, to throw the borders open and bequeath their hard-won
            territory and culture to battalions of Third Worlders and other
            temperamentally distant aliens, who of course given large enough
            numbers will promptly, whether wittingly or consequentially, execute

          Colin Liddell, amid an impressively cool-headed
          <a href="http://alternative-right.blogspot.jp/2014/07/swimming-in-our-enemies.html">discussion</a>
          of John Engelman and racial neuralgia:

        <p>
          <em>Jared Taylor is trying very, very hard to avoid the Jewish question.
            Naturally I disagree with this, but I can understand why Taylor wishes
            to do so, as the Jewish Question has become a kind of lightning rod
            for a lot of angst and rage in our society that does not have the
            time, sophistication, or emotional equilibrium to attain to a more
            complex understanding of the challenges of modernity.</em>

          Whatever one’s opinion on the JQ, it is important as the marker for a
          still intellectually under-developed schism, dividing the meritocratic
          and tribalistic strains of HBD. This blog is surreptitiously sympathetic
          to WN claims that it is being systematically evaded on the Right out of
          evasive cowardice. The main reason for this evasion is that anti-semitic
          WNs tend to be over-excitable, inarticulate proles, whose commentary —
          to quote Liddell — is characterized by “humourless, droning, brittle
          outrage” if not outright splenetic abuse. (In fairness, I have to note
          that on the rare occasions when extreme anti-semites have visited this

          fascinating piece on Trump-fervor in Chinese elite opinion. It’s all
          good. Quasi-random snippet:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The past 30 years of China’s economic growth and social development
            began after a period of chaos [i.e., the Cultural Revolution], and
            there was no Enlightenment-like intellectual movement. Government
            officials, in order to mobilize reform, exaggerated the evils of the
            old benefit system as “everyone eating from one big pot,” which, with
            the assistance of some scholars, led to an almost complete social
            consensus that a market economy means completely free competition.
            With no restraint from ethics or rules, the “law of the jungle” that
            the weak are prey to the strong became nearly universal in society.
            Amid all the worship of the strong and disdain for the weak, an
            atmosphere of care and equal treatment of disadvantaged groups has not
            formed. Therefore “political correctness,” which is for the protection
            of vulnerable groups, basically does not exist in Chinese society, and
            the language of discrimination, objectification of women, and mockery
            of disabled people is everywhere. […] This way of thinking is further
            reinforced among some Chinese elites: they succeed because they are
            better able to adapt to and dominate this kind of environment. In this
            process, they are hurt by others, they hurt others, and gradually they
            develop a heart of stone and a feeling of superiority — that their
            success is due to their own efforts and natural abilities, and the
            losers in competition must be those who don’t work hard because they
            are lazy or have some other problems. Therefore, they believe in free
            competition and personal striving even more than ordinary people, and
            also feel more strongly that poor people deserve their low position,
            are more wary of the abuse of welfare by lazy people, and are more
            supportive of Trump’s attacks on political correctness.</em>

          </a>
          <p>
            Neoreactionaries have a thing about Puritanism. Whether or not this
            trait is conceptually essential is a question for another time. The
            important point, right now, is that it serves as a
            <em>cladistic marker</em>. Whatever it might be that neoreaction
            speciates into, it bears this trait as an indication of cultural
            ancestry, bookmarking the
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com">root</a>-code
            archive of Mencius Moldbug.
          </p>
          <p>
            When reconstructed as an argument, the Moldbuggian clade proposes a
            species of ethnographic categorization on a loosely Darwinian (and
            strongly evolutionary) model, according to which cultural phenomena are
            logically nested, in tree-like fashion, revealing a pattern of descent.
            When considering an English Darwinian Evolutionist, who is also an
            example of contemporary political progressivism, Moldbug
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-2.html">makes</a>
            this mode of analysis explicit:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>My belief is that Professor Dawkins is not just a Christian atheist.
              He is a <strong>Protestant atheist</strong>. And he is not just a
              Protestant atheist. He is a <strong>Calvinist atheist</strong>. And he
              is not just a Calvinist atheist. He is an
              <strong>Anglo-Calvinist atheist</strong>. In other words, he can be
              also be described as a <strong>Puritan atheist</strong>, a
              <strong>Dissenter atheist</strong>, a
              <strong>Nonconformist atheist</strong>, an

            <span id="more-1153"></span>If there were a Thirty-Nine Articles of
            neoreaction, some suitably compressed version of this cladogram would
            constitute the primary tenet of the creed. Among the logically most
            attenuated twigs of this scheme, sub-speciated to the limit of cladistic
            definition, is found the globally-dominant sovereign instance of
            advanced modernity — the Cathedral (the enemy).

            It is not surprising, therefore, that the ‘Puritan question’ remains the
            core preoccupation of the neoreactionary Dark Enlightenment. This has
            been illustrated with consummate clarity by an article posted by J. M.
            Smith at <em>The Orthosphere</em>, contesting the Christian genealogy of
            the Cathedral, and the subsequent rejoinder by descendants of the
            neoreactionary clade — of varying religious persuasions —

            reacts with some bemusement to the polemical framing of the
            Smith text, because what he encounters is an argument without
            disagreement:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>At The Orthosphere,
              <a href="http://orthosphere.org/2013/08/25/christians-did-not-built-the-cathedral/">there’s a post</a>
              purporting to argue that the Cathedral was not constructed by
              Christians. Presumably the title was changed by someone other than the
              author of the text of the post, because the post ably demonstrates
              that Christians did in fact build the Cathedral. Indeed, the post is
              recommended.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Cladistic method contributes significantly to an understanding of these
            relationships. In particular, it is essential to grasp the logic of
            taxonomic naming, which perfectly corresponds to pure genealogy, and the
            ideal reconstruction of evolutionary relatedness. The crucial point:
            <em>A cladistic name refers to everything that is encompassed by a
              splitting-off, speciation, or schism</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the risk of superfluous explanation, it might be worth rehearsing
            this logic with a colloquialized biological example (using familiar
            rather than technical taxonomic descriptors). Paleontologists are
            supremely confident that amphibians evolved from bony fishes, and
            reptiles evolved from amphibians. This can be reformulated, without loss
            of information, as a cladistic series (of branchings), with bony fishes
            including amphibians,which in turn include reptiles. In other words, as
            a cladistic name, a ‘bony fish’ describes an initial speciating split
            from an ancestral clade, which — projected forwards — encompasses every
            subsequent speciation, in this case amphibians, and reptiles. Both
            amphibians and reptiles are bony fish. So are mammals, apes, and human
            beings. Bony fish, as a clade, comprehends every descendant species that
            has bony fish ancestry, whether extinct, still existent, or still to
            come. Nothing that has bony fish ancestry, however distant, can ever
            cease to be a bony fish (whatever else it becomes, in addition).
            Cladistically, it is <em>obvious</em> that humans are bony fish, as well
            as far simpler and more primordial things.
          </p>
          <p>Smith writes:</p>
          <p>
            <em>… a Great Schism rent American Protestantism in the early nineteenth
              century, with the sundering fissure tearing through denominations, and
              even congregations. Protestants on one side of the fissure called
              themselves “liberals,” those on the other side called themselves
              “orthodox.”</em>
            <em>… Liberal Protestantism is a new, post-Christian religion that in its
              early stages opportunistically spoke in a Christian idiom, but
              nevertheless preached a new gospel.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            We have seen, however, that from a cladistic point of view, nothing
            arising as a schism from X ever becomes ‘post-X’. There is no such thing
            as a post-bony-fish, a post-reptile, or a post-ape. Nor,  by strict
            logical analogy, can there ever be such things as post-Abrahamic
            Monotheists, post-Christians, post-Catholics, post-Protestants,
            post-Puritans, or post-Progressives. It is a logical impossibility for
            ancestral clades  to ever be evolutionarily superseded. To have
            Christianity as a cultural ancestor is to remain Christian forever. That
            is no more than terminological precision, from the
            cladistic-neoreactionary perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steves
            <a href="http://nickbsteves.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/more-on-the-puritan-hypothesis/">elucidates</a>
            the same point in a closely-related vocabulary: “… there
            <em>are</em> atheist Catholics. Why? Because being Catholic is cultural.
            It is not <em>only</em> that, but it is also <em>at least</em> that.”
            Cultures are genealogically or cladistically organized — that is the
            neoreacionary presupposition. (Lateral complications are not entirely
            inconceivable —
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_%28philosophy%29">link</a>
            to a truly ghastly Wikipedia entry on an important thought: the
            non-treelike network. That’s not for now.)
          </p>
          <p>
            What, though, of neoreaction itself? What did it split from? Like
            everything else under investigation here, unless it is comprehended as a
            schism, it is not comprehended at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            When cladistically approached, the primordial split is the ineluctable
            question of identity, or persistent ancestry. We can, perhaps, postpone
            it momentarily, but it will eventually lead us in directions that are
            more than a little
            <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/faj.aspx">Lovecraftian</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What was the last thing that neoreaction was submerged within, before
            arising, through schism? (That investigation has to await another post.)

            If there’s such a thing as a comprehensive cultural map of the world,
            it’s woven on to something very like this. No opportunity to comment on
            it right now — but I’m confident it will spark some responses.

          <p>
            That’s roughly Gregory Hood’s title, for an
            <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/11/18/a-god-to-damn-us">article</a>
            making the case for a return to paganism. As his point of departure,
            Hood examines, unflinchingly, the indications of an Occidental
            <em>desire</em> for enslavement or destruction by Islam. “It’s a kind of
            ethical exhaustion — liberal Whites are weary of the moral
            responsibility of existence and survival.” (The diagnosis seems
            hideously plausible to me.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Islam is Nature’s solution. Like the Architect from
              <strong>The Matrix Reloaded</strong>, it is Nature’s way of saying
              that “There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.” It is
              stultifying, depressing, and tyrannical. It is an enemy of real
              culture, with the most militant variations smashing the tombs and
              shrines not only of other religious traditions, but of their own.
              Modern Wahhabism is funded by Western decadence, enabled by Western
              weakness, in many ways a product of Western postmodernism and
              self-hatred. […] And lest what I say be misunderstood, it is
              obviously, laughably, and comically false. It is sustained by the
              protective cordon it has created around criticism. Yet believing that
              a pedophiliac illiterate transcribed the literal word of God still
              makes more sense than believing all men are created equal. Islam’s
              refusal to allow critical analysis of itself is a sign of strength,
              not weakness.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Islam is the first term in Hood’s tetralemma. It’s the executioners
            blade for a civilization that has lost all cosmic purchase upon
            existence. A disgusting way to die, begged for by the broken, in the end
            (which is already) — because at least it’s a way to die.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remaining three terms entertained by Hood are the “god of our
            grandfathers, the White Christ upon whose image the West was built”
            which “is dying”, faithless liberalism (including modern Christianity),
            and paganism. Among these options, he declares, “The Old Gods are my own
            choice.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-4142"></span>Much of this analysis — down to its grimmest
            conclusions — is highly compelling, even when abstracted from the flow
            of Hood’s vigorous prose. The proposed remedy, however, is by far its
            weakest component.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make a <em>choice</em> among Gods, is that not the final expression
            of liberalism, and therefore of degenerated Christianity? If we have
            learnt anything from the manifold failures of multiculturalism, it is
            that religious freedom is downstream of religion. ‘Freedom of
            conscience’ lies at the furthest remove from a genuinely secular
            conception, if any such thing is even possible. If it now seems
            imaginable to shop for different gods, it is because of the way a
            distinctive religious tradition has worked out. If political
            considerations seem to occupy a position of meta-religious authority,
            the descent has been deeper still. Choice is <em>internal</em> to
            religion, even if the decayed <em>image</em> of religion serves to
            obscure this fundamental fact. Contemporary Occidental paganism remains
            dissident Christianity. There is no decision that could alter that.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Hood himself states:
            <em>The very fact that I frame this identity as a “choice” is itself
              proof of decadence — a vibrant metaphysics simply is and has nothing
              to do with a rational actor listing pros and cons. Ironically, those
              who profess the Old Gods are weakened because what they profess is so
              obviously new and a product of innovation and modernity. Few would
              even call it a real faith that actually expresses literal belief in
              personalized divinities. […] The new pagan cults that preach
              fanaticism and virility owe too much to reason and deconstruction.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            A God that is not the very principle of destiny is no God at all. Are
            we, then, <em>destined</em> to rediscover the Old North European Gods?
            The impossibility of answering such a question with confident
            affirmation says everything necessary about it. The Old Gods manifestly
            failed against the challenge of the new One. There is no reason at all
            to suspect that this outcome has been rescinded by the subsequent
            calamities befalling the new faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Religions are providential. They are units of fate. The claims they make
            far exceed rational controversy or personal decision, in the abyss of
            their decadence no less than at the apex of their flourishing. If
            Christian Modernity is a process of escalating nihilism, as Nietzsche
            conceived it to be, it is nevertheless a road without turn-offs, that
            can only be followed to the end.
          </p>

            ADDED: Second long (italicized) quote has been grafted in, thanks to
            Irving (in comments below), who pointed out its clearly indispensable
            relevance to the topic. Just in case it is not already obvious, the Hood
            essay is a superbly crafted masterpiece — its quality only enhanced by
            its supple self-ironization. It deserves to be a landmark reference
            whenever this question re-arises, as it will continually do.

            <h4 class="post-title">Ethno-Cladistics</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            The Ethno-cladistic thesis, sketchily reconstructed
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cladistic-meditations/">here</a>
            from Mencius Moldbug’s neoreactionary usage, proposes that
            <strong>relations between</strong>
            <strong>cultural systems are captured by cladograms to a highly significant
              level of adequacy</strong>. The limits to this thesis are set by lateral complications —
            interchanges and modifications that do not conform to a pattern of
            branching descent — and these are by no means negligible. Nevertheless,
            actual cultural formations are dominated by cladistic order. As a
            consequence, cultural theories that assume taxonomic regularity as a
            norm are capable of reaching potentially realistic approximations, and
            furthermore offer the only prospect for the rigorous organization of
            ethnographic phenomena.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most direct and central defense of the ethno-cladistic thesis
            bypasses the comparatively high-level religious systems that provide the
            material for Moldbug’s arguments, and turn instead to the ethnographic
            root phenomenon: language. Languages simply <em>are</em> cultures in
            their fundamentals, so that any approach applicable to them will have
            demonstrated its general suitability for cultural analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d try to spin this out melodramatically, but I don’t think there’s
            really any point:

            It seems indisputable (to me) that lateral complications of these basic
            cladistic schemes are marginal. Languages are naturally grouped in
            branching, tree-like structures, which like those of (metazoan)
            biological variety are simultaneously explanatory of historical
            processes and morphological relatedness, because they represent
            evolutionary processes of successive speciation. The dominant
            organization is a taxonomic hierarchy, conforming to the formal language
            of set theory. The real events captured by these schemes are schisms,
            whose logical relation is that of genus to species. In the case of
            culture, as with biology, the manifest evolutionary development
            indicates the existence of some efficient hereditary mechanism (whose
            unit of replicated information is tagged by Moldbug, among innumerable
            others, as a ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">meme</a>‘). On this last point, it is worth
            noting
            that taxonomic biological
            classification, and even genetics, preceded the biochemical discovery of
            DNA —  and was broadly confirmed, rather than disrupted, when this
            discovery took place. (The meme is an analogy, but not a metaphor.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethno-cladistics is the schematics of cultural heritage. Despite the
            bulldozer assertiveness of this post, it is not designed to block
            methodical efforts directed at the subversion of this model. As
            indicated, such efforts will necessarily involve the elaboration of
            lateral (or ‘rhizomatic’) diagrams — a project of great intrinsic
            significance (and creative potential). Techno-commercial processes are
            strongly associated with lateralizations of this kind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Culture, however, is <em>fundamentally heritage</em>, and
            ethno-cladistics is the theoretical response to this basic historical
            fact. This is already Moldbug’s tacit claim, which should be
            uncontroversial among reactionaries of any kind. At the core  of the
            neoreactionary endeavor is the cladogram.

            My main quibble is with the chromatics — a single color for the
            Anglosphere would have been helpful. More generally, a correspondence of
            color with language groups would have given a more intuitive picture of
            history’s shape.

            Whilst dazzlingly ignorant about Julius Evola, I can at least partially
            understand the attraction his work generates for the
            ultra-traditionalist wing of the Outer Right. Thomas F. Bertonneau,
            whose essays are always worth digesting carefully, produces a typically
            masterful overview
            <a href="http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4371">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evola represents a significant thread of early 20th century reactionary
            thinking, rooted in the discoveries of historical linguistics, and the
            intellectual formation of an ‘Indo-European’ people corresponding to its
            deep cultural cladistics. The core phenomenon that supports the
            mystical-reactionary interpretation of history is the unambiguous
            process of crudification that afflicts the Indo-European languages,
            evident through the line of grammatical degeneration from Sanskrit,
            through Attic Greek, to Latin, and then into the vulgar — even
            structurally collapsed — tongues of the modern European vernacular.
            Reactionary, hierarchical, and racially-inflected ideas comparable to
            Evola’s are easily identified in the writings of Martin Heidegger, among
            many others. Historical linguistics appears to apprehend a large-scale
            ethnic totality undergoing prolonged cultural deterioration at the
            fundamental (grammatical) level. Once this is noted, progressivism
            appears as pure irony — and as a comic confirmation of decline.

            <em>Outside in</em>, comparatively comfortable with chewed-up
            techno-commercial jargons and stripped-down communication protocols, is
            only minimally attentive to this particular ‘problem of tradition’
            (which it registers from a position of detachment). Insofar as
            ‘tradition’ is invoked, however, it seems to be a highly significant
            reference — and its tendency to relapse the problem back to a Sanskritic
            (Vedic) origin is surely worthy of disciplined commentary. Kali Yuga
            makes a lot of sense.

            of this concept was a building-block moment for NRx, but the trend in
            its usage has been dismally regressive. Apparently devised as a tool for
            the analysis of social identities, it is increasingly invoked as a
            rallying-cry for

            entirely toxic unless it is dramatically clarified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nydwracu initially employs the word ‘thede’ to designate the substance
            of group identity, “a superindividual grouping that its constituent
            individuals feel affiliation with and (therefore?) positive estimates
            of.” Thedes are multiple, overlapping, sometimes concentric, and honed
            by antagonistic in-group/out-group determinations. They are seen as
            following from the understanding that “Man is a social animal.”
            Ideological arguments disguise thede conflicts. At this level of
            abstraction, there is little to find objectionable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his <a href="http://jim.com/rights.html">essay</a> on Natural Law,
            Jim writes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Man is a rational animal, a social animal, a property owning animal,
              and a maker of things. He is social in the way that wolves and
              penguins are social, not social in the way that bees are social. The
              kind of society that is right for bees, a totalitarian society, is not
              right for people. In the language of sociobiology, humans are social,
              but not eusocial. Natural law follows from the nature of men, from the
              kind of animal that we are. We have the right to life, liberty and
              property, the right to defend ourselves against those who would rob,
              enslave, or kill us, because of the kind of animal that we are.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Occupying a band of group integration between ants and tigers, humans
            have <em>intermediate sociality</em>. Even the tightest mode of human
            social organization is loose relative to an ant colony, and even the
            loosest is tight relative to a solitary feline. In human societies,
            neither collectivity nor individuality is ever absolute, and — even
            though these ‘poles’ are commonly exaggerated for polemical purposes —
            they realistically apply only to a
            <em>range of group integrations</em> (which is both narrow and
            significantly differentiated). To say that “man is a social animal” does
            <em>not</em> mean that collectivity is the fundamental human truth, any
            more than the opposite. It means that man is a creature of the middle
            (and the middle has a span).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-3942"></span>Insofar as a thede corresponds to a unit of
            autonomous, reproducible social organization, it is a far narrower
            concept than the one Nydwracu outlines. A thede is an
            <em>ethnicity</em> if it describes a real — rather than merely
            conventional — unit of human population. This is, of course, to exclude
            a great variety of identity dimensions, including sex, sexual
            orientation, age, interests, star signs … as well as some of those
            Nydwracu mentions (musical subcultures and philosophical schools).
            Generalization of ‘thedes’ to include all self-conscious human groupings
            risks diffusion into frivolous subjectivism (and subsequent
            re-appropriation for alternative purposes).
          </p>
          <p>
            If the analysis of thedes begins with the recognition that man is a
            social animal, it is a grave error to immediately expand the scope of
            the concept to groups such as women, lesbians, dog-lovers, and black
            metal fans, since none of these correspond to biologically-relevant
            social groupings. If this is the way the notion is to be developed, this
            blog takes the first off-ramp into more biorealist territory. There are
            quite enough of such ‘thedes’ to be found already in university
            literature and grievance studies departments. ‘Thedism’ of this kind is
            simply
            <a href="http://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality">intersectionality</a>
            with a slight right-wing skew. It has no cladistic function, unless as
            degenerate metaphor.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a reliable heuristic, only those groupings which are plausible
            subjects of secessionist autonomization should be considered thedes. Any
            group that could not imaginably be any kind of micro-nation has only
            intra-thedish identity. More darkly, a thede — ‘properly’ speaking — is
            necessarily a potential object of
            <a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/before-slavery/">genocide</a>. (To argue this way is to
            depart
            radically from the usage Nydwracu
            recommends. It is not an attempt to wrest control of the word, but only
            to explain why it seems so basically impaired. This post will be the
            last time it is mangled here.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Rigorization of thede analysis in the direction of real ethnicities
            would also require the abandonment of attempts to assimilate classes to
            thedes, although class identities can mask thedes, and operate as their
            proxies. Between New England and Appalachia there is a (real) thede
            difference between ethnic populations, encrusted with supplementary
            class characteristics. Used strictly in this way, the idea of a thede
            does theoretical work, and uncovers something. It exposes the
            subterranean ethnic
            <a href="http://www.popehat.com/2014/10/10/strange-seeds-on-distant-shores/">war</a>
            disguised by class stratification. When merely used to classify generic
            social identities, on the other hand, it thickens the fog, pandering to
            the social constructivist mentality. Tribes and classes cannot be
            absorbed into a single super-concept without fatal loss of meaning. It
            is impossible to belong to a class in anything like the same sense that
            one can belong to an (ethnic) thede, <em>unless class is a cover</em>.
            Class stratification is primarily intra-thedish and trans-thedish. It is
            the way a population is organized, not a population itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Religious difference, in contrast, are typically thedish. By far the
            most important example, for the internal dissensions of NRx, and for the
            Occident in general, is the split between Catholic and Reformed
            (Protestant) Christianity. There are real (autonomously reproducible)
            Catholic and Protestant populations, and thus true thedes. Either could
            be wholly exterminated without the disappearance of the other.
            Furthermore, the way in which ‘thedishness’ is comprehended varies
            systematically between them. On strictly technical grounds, it is
            tempting to counter-pose high-integrity to low-integrity social
            arrangements, but that is to give away too much ammunition for free.
            (This is to depart into a different discussion, but one that is already
            overdue. (Alongside other
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism">obvious</a>
            references, <a href="https://twitter.com/nydwracu">Nydwracu</a> points
            to <a href="http://www.johndclare.net/Weimar6_Geary.htm">this</a>))
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethnicities correspond to real populations, and to cladistic structures.
            ‘Thedes’ as presently formulated do not. Ironically, this
            <em>denotational</em> haziness (super-generality) of the thede concept
            lends itself to usages guided by extremely concrete
            <em>connotations</em>, with a distinctive
            <em>Blut und Boden</em> flavor. Usage of the word ‘identity’ (at least,
            on the right) has exactly the same characteristics. This blog is done
            with the ‘thede’ concept unless its meaning is drastically tidied up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: Where this post wanted to go, when it set off,
            was closer to the ‘dogs vs cats’ debate, or
            <a href="http://dismagazine.com/dystopia/evolved-lifestyles/67148/what-is-seasteading/">this</a>:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Yeah there is a huge disconnect between the idea of seasteading as a
              platform for experimenting with various forms of governance and the
              reality that the vast majority of people interested in pursuing it are
              orthodox libertarians who see some kind of anarcho capitalist
              libertarianism as the inevitable winner in a ‘fair fight’ between
              political systems. I really think that a belief in libertarianism is
              linked to a distinctive and relatively rare neurological type, and
              therefore will never convince the vast majority of people who tend
              towards a more altruistic and collectivized morality.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is at least conceivable that neuro-atypical hyper-individualists
            could establish a micro-nation (or be exterminated). They could
            therefore lay claim to thedish identity, although in a strict sense —
            that no one wants to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            ADDED: Since this is my last opportunity to borrow ‘thede’ to mean
            something with substantial real content (i.e. an autonomous,
            self-reproducing social unit), it’s worth enumerating some possible
            thedes, to give a sense of its extension: tribes, ethnic groups
            (concentrically-ordered), cities, seasteads, space colonies … “What is
            your thede?” translates as “Who are your people?” — “Stamp collectors”
            shouldn’t be considered a serious answer.

            (<a href="http://racehist.blogspot.hk/2015/02/kinship-coefficients-and-ethnic-genetic.html">here</a>). It’s
            a
            fascinating discussion, that has
            <a href="https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/your-countrys-not-your-blood/">divided</a>
            Cochran and Harpending, which is an indication of its seriousness. Sadly
            — if understandably — it tends to generate massive rancor very quickly,
            as is evident in the tone of some of these posts. That’s especially
            unfortunate because, heated race politics aside, there’s a massive
            amount of philosophical substance underlying it. (Maximum coldness would
            certainly be appreciated here.)
          </p>
          <p>
            A suggestive remark from Salter (p.28), on the disrupted equilibrium
            between ‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’ interests (a crucial and
            thought-provoking distinction):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The equilibrium applying to humans has been upset in recent
              generations, so that we can no longer rely on subjectively designated
              proximate interests to serve our ultimate interest. We must rely more
              on science to perceive the causal links between the things we value
              and formulate synthetic goals based on that rational appraisal.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            So (subject to correction as the argument progresses) Salter proposes an
            explicit, rational proxy for the ‘ultimate interests’ of genetic
            propagation, now inadequately represented by change-shocked phenotypes
            (and, most importantly, brains). This is a Principal-Agent
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">problem</a>, applied to human
            biology.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-5450"></span>Here is Salter laying out his problem at
            greater length:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Certainly we can no longer rely on our instincts to guide us through
              the labyrinths of modern technological society. But there is one
              innate capacity we possess that, combined with one or more
              motivations, is capable of solving this problem. Humans are uniquely
              equipped with analytic intelligence, the ability to tackle novel
              challenges. This ‘domain general’ problem-solving capacity evolved
              because it allowed our ancestors to find solutions to novel threats
              that arose in the environments in which they lived. General
              intelligence is distinguished from ‘domain specific capacities, such
              as face recognition and speech, specialized mental modules for solving
              recurring problems in the environments in which we evolved. We are
              flexible strategizers par excellence, able to construct our own micro
              environments across a great diversity of climates and ecosystems.
              Abstract intelligence is physiologically costly because it requires a
              large brain, difficult childbirth and extended childhood. Nevertheless
              it has been so adaptive that it distinguishes our species. It allows
              us to consciously assess dangers and opportunities and to devise novel
              solutions, or to choose a well-rehearsed routine from our extensive
              repertoire to apply in a given situation. Now changed environments
              have effectively blinded us to large stores of our genetic interests,
              or to put it more accurately, for the first time situated us where we
              need to perceive those interests and be motivated to pursue them. This
              blindness is not cured by a people’s economic and political power, as
              documented in Chapter 3, regarding the decline of Western populations.
              We must rely on our intelligence to adapt, not only using science to
              perceive our fundamental interests in the abstract but devising ways
              to realize these interests through proximate interests, the short-term
              goals of which we are aware and towards which we are motivated to
              act.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a far more general topic here than racial antagonism (without
            wanting to dismiss the importance of that). Putting it up here now is a
            test of whether it can be discussed without throwing people into a rage.
            If so, it could become an engaging conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Googling Moravec’s concept of ‘replicator usurpation’ for a cite, it
            seems that I’m the only person who’s being talking about it for over a
            decade. That’s disappointing, because its relevance to these questions
            seems obvious. I’m going to need to look it up again in order to come
            back here with a helpful quote.)

            <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003501.html">ADDED</a>: Gloss
            and critical commentary from David B. at
            <em>Gene Expression</em> (2005): “It is essential to understand that
            Salter is <em>not</em> presenting a biological theory of how people have
            evolved, how they will evolve in future, or why they behave in the way
            they do. [Note 2] As Salter puts it himself: ‘the present work is not
            primarily a theory of human behavior, but of interests. Rather than
            being a work of explanation, this is mainly an exercise in political
            theory dealing with what people are able to do if they want to behave
            adaptively (p.85)… my main goal in this chapter is not to describe how
            people actually behave. Rather, I explore how individuals would behave
            if they were attempting to preserve their genetic interests (p.257)’.
            Some of these remarks might suggest that Salter is merely setting out an
            option that people may wish to follow or not, according to their own
            values, but it can hardly be doubted that Salter himself positively
            <em>advocates</em> the pursuit of ethnic genetic interests, principally
            through the control of immigration. The use of such terms as ‘adaptive’,
            ‘fitness’, and ‘ultimate interests’ could in principle have a neutral
            biological sense, but in practice Salter uses them with an evaluative
            force: he regards the policies he discusses not just as possible but
            <em>desirable</em>. Otherwise why say that we ‘need to perceive’ our
            genetic interests and ‘be motivated to pursue them’? From time to time
            he overtly uses the mode of recommendation rather than mere analysis,
            for example, ‘Multiculturalism and other versions of ethnic pluralism…
            are types of ethnic regime that majorities should certainly avoid
            (p.188)… Since genetic interests are the most fundamental, liberals
            [sic] should support social policies that take these vital interests
            into account (p.250)’. And some of the language and comparisons Salter
            uses are strongly emotive … much of Salter’s book is concerned with
            immigration, and especially immigration from third-world countries to
            the West. In my view there are sound arguments against large-scale,
            uncontrolled immigration from the third-world, not least the danger of
            civil strife resulting from the presence of large unassimilated groups
            holding values and beliefs incompatible with those of the host society.
            But it would be unwise for people who object to uncontrolled immigration
            on these grounds to latch onto Salter’s ideas. Whatever Salter’s own
            motives, his theory is being taken up enthusiastically by racists (as a
            Google search will confirm), and anyone who follows their lead will be
            tainted by association. Since even by Salter’s own account his theory is
            not a scientific thesis, but more of a political manifesto, there can be
            no compelling reason for non-racists to accept it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            David B.’s final point is especially relevant to some of the issues
            hinted at in the post here (targeted for future development): “…
            Salter’s doctrine is profoundly <em>anti-eugenic</em>. For Salter, it is
            in the interest of an individual to preserve and promote the gene
            frequencies of his own ethnic group, whether the existing gene frequency
            is good, bad or indifferent, as judged by qualitative criteria. So, for
            example, it is in the interest of American blacks to promote their own
            gene frequencies against those of American whites, even if in some
            respects it would be better for blacks themselves to change those gene
            frequencies. The doctrine of genetic interests is inherently
            backward-looking and conservative. In contrast, the eugenic position is
            that we are able to make value judgements about what characteristics are
            desirable (such as health, intelligence, and beauty) and undesirable
            (such as stupidity, mental illness, and physical disabilities) and then
            to take reproductive decisions based on those judgements. Of course
            eugenics is controversial, but many of those who might feel vaguely
            sympathetic to Salter’s approach would also feel vaguely sympathetic to
            eugenics, and they should at least be aware of the conflict between
            them.”

          <p>
            Since the opportunities for XS to agree (in
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cladistic-meditations/">advance</a>)
            with PZ Myers don’t come along too regularly, it’s worth seizing upon
            <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2016/07/02/yes-you-are-a-fish/">those</a>
            that do. For anyone who thinks cladistics are important, this point is
            worth strongly defending:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>There are multiple meanings of “fish”. We can use it to refer to
              specific species or an extant category of animals: salmon are fish,
              halibut are fish, herring are fish. No one objects to that, and they
              all understand that if I said “humans are still salmon”, that would be
              wrong. […] But another way the term is used is as a descriptor for a
              clade. A taxonomic clade is a
              <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/search/imagedetail.php?id=260">“grouping that includes a
                common ancestor and all the descendants
                (living and extinct) of that ancestor”</a>. […] So, for instance, humans belong to the mammalian clade,
              which
              includes mice and cats and cows. If we have transhuman, part-cyborg
              descendants, they will still be mammals, because, note, by definition
              a clade must include all the descendants of an ancestor. We’re
              trapped! There’s no way our progeny can exit the clade!</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, it’s such a sound point, it’s worth
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/ethno-cladistics/">generalizing</a>.

            Mark Warburton passed
            <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/105781867/1/A-Conclusion">this</a>
            masterpiece along (<em>Revolutionary Apocalypse</em>, by Luciano
            Pellicani). A couple of tiny morsels from its consistently brilliant —
            and eerily familiar — analysis:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>With Puritanism, an absolutely new element was introduced into
              Western civilisation:
              <strong>(revolutionary) politics as fulfillment of God’s will</strong>, with the objective of consciously
              building “a new human community,
              that could substitute the lost Eden” and produce a prodigious “change
              in human nature.” For centuries, politics had been conceived as a
              “cybernetic art” (Plato) or as a technique for the accumulation of
              power (Machiavelli). From the Puritan cultural revolution on, politics
              was conceived as a <strong>soteriological practice</strong>, dominated
              by an
              <strong>eschatological tension toward the Kingdom of God on earth</strong>, therefore as a calling, whose
              methodical objective was to overturn
              the world in order to purify it. The slogan originally used by the
              Taborites and the Anabaptists was revived: “Permanent warfare against
              the existing, in the name of the New World.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>And:</p>
          <p>
            <em>An all-powerful state is essential for communism, since
              <strong>the total destruction of civil society</strong> is the only
              way to destroy capitalism. By civil society we mean the “society of
              industry, of general competition, of freely pursued private interest,
              of anarchy, of natural and spiritual individuality alienated from
              self.” But since capitalism — Lenin’s definition is correct — is a
              phenomenon that is generated spontaneously, whenever the ideological
              power relaxes its watch, the effort to prevent mammon from raising its
              head must be permanent. It is a matter of
              <strong>annihilation</strong> that requires
              <strong>mass terror</strong>, since the main enemy of communism is
              “widespread petit bourgeois spontaneity.” Thus, the “revolutionary
              project challenges the normal course of history.” It is a huge effort
              to prevent humanity from moving spontaneously toward a bourgeois
              society. This is only achieved through permanent terror.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If Pellicani is already being widely discussed in the reactosphere, I’ve
            missed it. My guess: he’ll be considered an indispensable reference by
            this time next year.

              You know, your general trope of modern SWPLs not being the descendents
              of the Puritans doesn’t actually hold water. A simple comparison of
              both genetic and self-reported ancestry (again aforementioned link,
              partially supplied by you) shows that Democratic voting Whites are
              only found in areas Puritans settled. British ancestry backs it up.

              Now, in New England, some of that genetic British ancestry is
              Scottish, as opposed to English ancestry. I think we can be fairly
              certain the Scots aren’t the ones pushing things Left.

            <em>Sure, today’s SWPLs are heavily admixed with other groups in addition

              Mormons – but

              which have Puritan (as well as Scandinavian, and possibly Quaker)
              descendants. It does limited (some, but limited) good to compare their
              attitudes 200-400 years ago with current ones – all groups have
              undergone considerable change during that time (the moral circle
              expanded to fill its genetic potential). You also can’t blame it on
              the Jews because A) there’s not that many of them B) their putative
              influence resonates with some and not others, putting us back to the

            <em>Politics of Guilt and Pity</em> (full-<a
              href="http://chalcedon.edu/research/books/politics-of-guilt-and-pity-2/">text</a>
            available free online) is looking truly awesome so far. A couple of
            early snippets:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The reality of man apart from Christ is guilt and masochism. And
              guilt and masochism involve an unshakeable inner slavery which governs
              the total life of the non-Christian. The politics of the
              anti-christian will thus inescapably be
              <strong>the politics of guilt</strong>. In the politics of guilt, man
              is perpetually drained in his social energy and cultural activity by
              his over-riding sense of guilt and his masochistic activity. He will
              progressively demand of the state a redemptive role. What he cannot do
              personally, i.e., to save himself, he demands that the state do for
              him, so that the state, as man enlarged, becomes the human savior of
              man. The politics of guilt, therefore, is not directed, as the
              Christian politics of liberty, to the creation of godly justice and
              order, but to the creation of a redeeming order, a saving state. Guilt
              must be projected, therefore, on all those who oppose this new order
              and new age. And, because the salvation is mythical, and the
              enslavement real, the hatred of life and of innocence grows, and with
              it grows the urge to mass destruction.</em>
          </p>
          <p>[…]</p>
          <p>
            <em>In the modern state, in the name of democracy, there is the
              increasing pandering to guilt and to the hatred felt by the guilty for
              the innocent and for the successful. This then is the full triumph of
              the politics of guilt and its open enthronement. For the politics of
              guilt, the order of the day is mass destruction. […] Sentimental
              humanism asserts that man’s basic need is <strong>love</strong>, more
              specifically, a passive need <strong>to be loved</strong>. Thus, man
              is seen as a passive creature whose basic problem is not a will to
              evil but an absence of love, so that a positive agency must be created
              to supply man’s needs. The result is the totalitarian caretaker state.
              Man, being passive, needs an active agency in his life, and this

            <em>In <strong>guilt</strong> cultures, the individual deals directly and
              personally with the inner warfare. Man, burdened with a sense of guilt
              and unable to enjoy life, confesses his sin, as does the man in a
              <strong>shame</strong> culture, but he pleads guilty to the lesser
              crime. With a fine sensitivity, he dredges up minor offenses to prove
              the refinement of his conscience in order to escape his capital
              offense against God. He may trouble himself over a stolen pencil while
              ignoring his open or veiled warfare against God. In the United States,
              as the nation has departed progressively from God, it has indulged
              progressively in a “debunking” of its history, in a general confession
              of many past faults, some often imagined. The hypocrisy of such
              confessions is striking: by confessing the “sins” of past generations,
              the present scholar or generation thereby implies its own superior
              virtues and its innocence of those sins. By the fact of such
              “debunking” or confession, it confesses also, very modestly, that
              wisdom is now born to us and is among us, so that confession again
              becomes a vehicle of pride.</em>

            <em>What man cannot do, i.e., to cleanse himself of sin or to make
              atonement to God for sin, God does for man. Men, being wholly God’s
              creation, cannot be active towards God; his relationship is derivative
              and passive. Man’s will is not autonomous, nor is man creative in
              relationship to God. Hence, since God is God, the relationship between
              man and God is wholly a part of the eternal decree and wholly
              determined by the triune God.</em>

            <em>Today, millions of Negroes, joined by millions of slave whites, are
              demanding that the federal government become their slave-master and
              provide them with security and care. Slavery is a welfare economy;
              private ownership is a privately maintained welfare economy, and it is
              not economically a sound unit of operation. Under state ownership,
              slavery, a social security structure, is a welfare economy which lacks
              the necessity for successful operation which the private owner must
              maintain. The private owner must make a profit somewhere; Alexander H.
              Stephens made it in law and supported his slaves thereby. The
              slave-owning state survives instead by progressive confiscation until
              the nation is destroyed. […] … Slavery remains, however, a legitimate
              way of life, but a lower way of life. Slavery offers certain penalties
              as well as certain advantages. Objectively, the penalty is the
              surrender of liberty. Subjectively, the slave does not see the
              surrender of freedom as a penalty, since he desires escape from
              freedom. Even as a timid and fearful child dreads the dark, so does
              the slave mind fear liberty: it is full of the terrors of the unknown.
              As a result, the slave mind clings to statist or state slavery,
              cradle-to-grave welfare care, as a fearful child clings to his mother.
              The advantage of slavery is precisely this, security in the master or
              in the state. Socialism is thus a slave state, created by the demands
              of slaves for a master.</em>

          </a>
          <p>
            Cladistic inheritance necessitates that I begin talking about the
            Calvinist doctrine of Providence here (soon), despite my total cognitive
            depravity on the topic. I’ve been reading the
            <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.html"><em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em></a>,
            and
            around it, but inevitably as if from Mars (and as a Confucian).
            It has to be the case that many of the visitors here are vastly more
            intellectually fluent on the subject, so any anticipatory comments will
            be hungrily seized upon.
          </p>
          <p>The fatality, as far as it is initially evident:</p>
          <p>
            (1) Neoreaction,
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cladistic-meditations/">cladistically</a>
            located, is a Cryptocalvinist splinter.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) The doctrines that
            <a href="http://oldlife.org/2013/10/lutheranism/">placed</a> Calvinism
            in H. L. Mencken’s “cabinet of horrors” (“next to cannibalism”), have
            never been <em>philosophically</em> dissolved, whether by theological or
            secular argument.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) The moralistic dismissal of Modernity and, through association, of
            Protestantism, evidences an almost incomprehensibly crude conception of
            Providence — as if the way things have turned out was not a fatality,
            and in theological terms a <em>message</em> (or punishment), but rather
            an accident, or man-made contingency. The rigorous theology of Modernity
            cannot reduce to mere
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/an-enduring-faith/">denunciation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) Calvinism is an instrument with which to explore Catholicism,
            especially in respect to its implicit philosophy of history (and
            recourse to teleological reasoning). The ‘Neo-‘ in Neoreaction appears
            to be a Calvinist mark. There are any number of influential secular
            explanations for the way history has tortured the Church — such that
            even the religious seem typically to default to them. Where does one
            find a radically providential account (excavating the theological
            meaning of Modernity)?
          </p>
          <p>
            (5) Is not the very word ‘Cathedral’ in its Neoreactionary usage a
            complex providential sign? (Which suggests that it has far more to tell
            than anything either Neoreactionary writers or mere accident put into
            it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (6) The cluster of disputes around ‘predestination’ (or the action of
            eternity upon history) is the Occidental key to the problem of time.
          </p>
          <p>I’m sure there’s much more …</p>

            Walter Russell Mead
            <a
              href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/12/15/peace-in-the-congo-why-the-world-should-care/">muses</a>
            on identitarian blood-letting.
          </p>
          <p>First the sermon:</p>
          <p>
            <em>The eastern Congo and the African Great Lakes are remote places, and
              many people might wonder why Americans or the world at large should
              care much about what goes on there. The short answer is that the
              people who live there are made in God’s image as much as anybody else
              and they are infinitely dear to him, and to remain indifferent to the
              suffering of people there is to fail in our clear duty to our Creator
              and to some degree to betray our own humanity.</em>
          </p>
          <p>Then the analysis:</p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1797"></span><em>While the world’s intelligentsia today spends an endless amount of
              time “celebrating difference” and singing the praises of diversity
              (and we join in that chorus), diversity and difference constitute
              potentially catastrophic political challenges. One thing that seems to
              happen with modernization is that groups of people start feeling more
              need to have the state and the laws reflect the values and the
              priorities of their own ethnic or religious communities. Identity
              demands to be reflected in politics.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Pre-modern and “primitive” cultures don’t seem to feel this as
              strongly as more modern ones do, and democracies are sometimes even
              more chauvinistic than other forms of government as these pressures
              are felt. It is often populists who lead campaigns for ethnic
              cleansing or nationalist war. The history of Europe and the Middle
              East has been shaped by 150 years of sometimes genocidal wars of
              conquest, revenge, national liberation and religion. Tens of millions
              have been killed in these wars, multinational states have broken down
              into ethnic nation states, and millions of refugees have been forced
              into exile.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>[…] One of the biggest questions of the 21st century is whether this
              destructive dynamic can be contained, or whether the demand for
              ethnic, cultural and/or religious homogeneity will continue to
              convulse world politics, drive new generations of conflict, and create
              millions more victims. […] … the foundations of our world are
              dynamite, and that the potential for new conflicts on the scale of the
              horrific wars of the 20th century is very much with us today.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words: “If everyone shared my (religious) identity, we wouldn’t
            be tilting into a century of blood and horror.” Even if this dubious
            argument was to be accepted at face value,
            <strong><em>they don’t</em></strong>, and <strong><em>we are</em></strong>.

            “…  Great State leaders take the erroneous intellectual short cut of
            assuming that foreigners are just human beings who think just like they
            do and who focus on the same priorities. … This tendency to a kind of
            passive, subconscious, egalitarian universalism is, of course, greatly
            amplified if you are actually an Egalitarian Universalist because that
            is effectively your official state religion …”

            I have a few quibbles — Vaisyas aren’t ‘activists’ (because business
            isn’t politics), and the Catholic slant of NRx is more complicated than
            this essay makes it out to be (because

            The decisive reservation has to do with the social function of

            ‘Silicon Valley’ changes the meaning of ‘Brahmin’ — if we’re still going
            to use that word. Most simply, the long-established
            <em>distinction</em> between literate and industrial elites loses its
            security in the epoch of programming, or digitization. NRx washes back
            from a social horizon at which the sign and its operationalization have
            become de-segmented, necessitating a seismic re-configuration of class
            identities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Brahmin priest caste, like the digital elite, specializes in signs,
            but they are signs of exhortation, rather than of intrinsic efficiency.
            Is not <em>the Cathedral</em> precisely a name for that apparatus of
            signs — (non-STEM) academia, media, bureaucracy, politics … — which
            cannot in principle <em>ever compile</em>? The Cathedral is a secular
            religion, which has to preach because it does not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            When NRx insists upon a division within ‘progress’ between
            techno-economics (which works) and socio-politics (which decays), it
            opens a rift that splits the Brahmins, rather than further separating
            them from social inferiors. NRx, at its core, is a ‘Brahmin’ civil war.

            the trigger. For instance: Exit. Imagine a near-future world in which
            political disputes were dominated by QS cults. It would be remarkably
            tolerant of electoral processes, whose defects would have been made a
            matter of indifference. Divide the social body on the issue of greatest
            political rancor, and submit the contest to a ‘resolution’ procedure
            with significant probabilistic input. Whoever loses terminates
            themselves, <em>in ‘this’ sector of the multiverse</em>. The outcome,
            from the perspective of the QS religion, would be that branching
            universes acquired increasingly distinctive ideological flavors.
            Everyone ends up with the future they selected, in worlds pre-cleansed
            of dissent. Elections would be OK, but why not just roll the dice? The
            important thing would be the schism, and from the QS perspective, every
            true devotee ends up on the right side of it.
            <em>This is the future you chose</em> would actually always be true.

            <em>Replace elections with the flip of a coin, accompanied by mass

            To be French is to understand—with peculiar lucidity—what it is to have
            been defeated by modernity. The world’s first modern nation, enthralled
            beyond all others by the call of the universal, has been cropped back to
            a nexus of untaken paths, over the course of two centuries. If Hubert
            Védrine says this more clearly than Alain Badiou, Badiou says it
            nevertheless. <em>Our Wound is Not So Recent</em>. The title already
            says almost everything. To anticipate: ‘…our wound comes from the
            historical defeat of communism.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to this primary, chronic and, by now,
            <em>essential</em> misfortune, occasional disasters are mere accidents.
            The recent massacre in Paris by soldiers of Jihad provides an unusually
            dramatic (or ‘particularly spectacular’) instance. Yet, despite its
            colorful, richly affective character, the disturbance of state security
            represented by the slaughter of a few score Parisians is a minor affair,
            when compared to the conquest of modernity itself—and thus the world—by
            a far more ominous adversary. Whatever philosophical dignity is to be
            found in reflection upon the November 13 incident lies in its cognitive
            adoption as a relay, leading back to the main story, ‘the triumph of
            globalised capitalism’.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is understandable, therefore, that the elegance of Badiou’s
            presentation is unable to fully conceal its structural irritability.
            ‘We’ have been <em>distracted</em>, which is how adults understand
            ‘terror’. It is a distraction of ‘thought’ that has occurred here,
            Badiou insists, and thus an annoyance, in multiple senses, including
            that of simple condescension. As befits a member of the socio-cultural
            elite, Badiou’s response takes the form of a thoughtful
            meta-irritation—an irritability directed at irritation as such. This is
            an anti-empirical reflex and therefore, in some definite way,
            ‘French’—but we will get to that soon enough. Those scores of dead
            youngsters strewn across Paris demand some affective acknowledgement,
            which is undignified (and annoying). Far more significantly, the
            atrocity upsets people. It is—precisely as intended by the perpetrators,
            and also in the most neutral sense of the word—<em>exciting</em>. The
            public response it elicits is not only philosophically useless, but
            positively deleterious to the work of the universal. ‘So, to counter
            these risks, I think that we must manage to think what has happened.’
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We have a duty to philosophy—which is to say, to our only credible
              model of nobility—<em>to be cold</em>. Emotional spasms in response to
              blood spatter would be unbecoming.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I think so, too. We have a duty to philosophy—which is to say, to our
            only credible model of nobility—<em>to be cold</em>. Emotional spasms in
            response to blood spatter would be unbecoming. It would also be an
            integral contribution to the achievement of ‘fascist’ terror. Worst of
            all, it distracts. Terror excites identity, by concentrating it, and
            packaging it in a false simplicity. Badiou is not concerned to disguise
            the fact that, for the European Left, in particular, ‘identity’ is the
            true terror.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are, however, other distractions—for ‘us’. When Badiou proclaims
            that ‘<em>Our</em> wound is not so recent’, we are compelled to ask: How
            far does this collective pronoun extend? A response to this question
            could be prolonged without definite limit. Everything we might want to
            say ultimately folds into it, ‘identity’ most obviously. Whatever
            meaning ‘communism’ could have belongs here, as ‘we’ reach outwards to
            the periphery of the universal, and thus (conceivably) to the end of
            philosophy. ‘Frenchness’ is, in some complex way, involved by it, among
            other social sets of lesser and greater obscurity. This ‘we’ is the
            whole, even as it is hidden in the margin. It is also strategically
            non-negotiable. (Nobody asks ‘who?’—as Badiou knows they will not.)
            Smuggled into grammar, it says everything of ultimate consequence in
            advance of any possible rejoinder, framing subsequent controversy in its
            terms. A sovereign or transcendental antagonism—settled securely beyond
            discussion—thus announces itself, in a whisper.
          </p>
          <p>
            In comparable fashion, then, <em>we</em> can only propose another ‘us’
            outside it. As already promised, the detail—if only a little—will soon
            follow. For the moment, it need only be noted that ‘their’ identity
            cannot be assumed to be ‘ours’, any more than we share their problems,
            their successes, or their defeats. The pronoun is scrambled, torn apart.
            We are not ‘wounded’ by what hurts them, unless accidentally, and by the
            failure of their collective project least of all. Whatever malice might
            appear in these words strikes us as sheer retaliation. This is only to
            say that Badiou’s ‘we’ was already a project of mobilization and a
            declaration of war, if only as a recollection, and a gesture of
            defiance. The haze that surrounds ‘us’ is the fog of war. No one can be
            sincerely <em>shocked</em> by that. (We are not children.) Our conflict
            is not so recent.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The stakes, on both sides, are absolute. There is—most probably—<em>nothing</em>

              each other
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            ‘It must be seen that the objective victory of globalized capitalism is
            a destructive, aggressive practice,’ Badiou asserts. We can only shrug,
            since of course, <em>for you</em> (collectively), that is simply true.
            Its successes are your defeats, and reciprocally. No one is being
            educated by any of this. We have, not so very long ago, menaced each
            other with thermonuclear warheads, and burnt down states still more
            recently. The stakes, on both sides, are absolute. There is—most
            probably—<em>nothing</em> we would not do, were it still necessary, in
            order to prevail against each other. ‘Victory’, ‘defeat’—these are
            Badiou’s words, even if—for no reason at all—<em>war</em> is not, at
            first, although it soon will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us explicate, then, that which Badiou leaves still partially
            implicit. <em>We do not care about Islam</em>. No one does—at least no
            one we care about, but only ‘fascists’. For the industrialized world, it
            is never more than an annoyance, and more typically a complex
            opportunity to be exploited, a weapon to be directed at those whose
            antagonism is respected. Having failed at modernity with a
            comprehensiveness that approaches the comedic, it has been many
            centuries since Islam has had any kind of serious claim upon history to
            lose—so ‘a whole section of the global population is counted for
            nothing’, inevitably. We can parasitize Badiou’s shallowly-buried
            contempt without qualification: ‘it’s fascization that islamizes, not
            Islam that fascizes’. We will decide upon the way to categorize their
            refusal of our categorizations. Your coldness is tested by this joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not that religion is quite nothing, of course, even for Badiou, at
            his most French. Not <em>originally</em>, in any case. ‘Religion can
            perfectly well act as an identitarian sauce for all of this, precisely
            in so far as it is a suitably anti-Western referent. But as we have
            seen, in the final analysis, the origin of these youths doesn’t matter
            much, their spiritual or religious origin, as they say, and so on.’ (It
            ‘is counted for nothing’.) ‘What counts is the choice they have made
            about their frustration’ (we decide). ‘And they will rally to the
            mixture of corruption and sacrificial and criminal heroism because of
            the subjectivity that is theirs, not because of their Islamic
            conviction. What is more, we have been able to see that, in most cases,
            islamization is terminal rather than inaugural.’ Nihilistic individuals,
            seduced into ‘fascism’, articulating their motivations in words that
            count for nothing, pathetic existentialist communists with false
            consciousness, malicious punks…if there are some further resources of
            contempt that might be added to this analysis, they will not be easy to
            find. Which is not at all to suggest that we encounter anything
            problematic here, or in need of rectification.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could easily have been some other faith that provided this
            ‘terminus’, we are expected to accept (unless the concession to ‘a
            suitably anti-Western referent’ is the clue to a more persuasive—and
            decorously unspoken—claim). All right, we accept. For the sake of moving
            forward, we accept it, despite the extraordinary deformation of
            historical evidence required to do so. Let us pretend that our Jihadi
            ‘fascists’ are only randomly differentiated from Buddhists or
            Confucians, in order to proceed to the identities that more immediately
            concern us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those dead Parisian youngsters cannot be ‘counted for nothing’ quite so
            easily. They would have certainly done some capitalism, even despite
            themselves, and also – being young and French—quite probably some
            communism, in addition, so they matter to ‘us’, at least a little. The
            young Jihadi ‘fascists’ who slaughtered them, in contrast—with nothing
            to make but a distraction—are nothing at all, to either of us. That
            saddens Badiou, rhetorically, and tactically. ‘Their own life did not
            count. And since their own lives did not count, the lives of others
            meant nothing to them either.’
            <em>Look what globalized capitalism did to them</em>. Perhaps we should
            turn our attention to this far more serious, historically-productive
            monstrosity, before we upset people—gratuitously—with our unfathomable
            <em>and entirely mutual</em> indifference.

            This <em>Thing</em>—the Great Foe—is not devoid of identity, however
            embarrassing it may be to explicitly acknowledge that fact (i.e. its
            factuality as such). To succumb to excitement about the empiricity of
            ‘Capitalist globalization’, in its scandalous singularity, is to thrill
            to its vast annoyance, rather than its universal disaster. Yet it is,
            <em>as everyone clearly recognizes</em>, an Anglophone global affliction
            that disturbs ‘us’, and an Anglophone ideological negligence that has
            ‘counted for nothing’ those without any productive part to play in its
            expansion. The <em>major</em> enemy is Anglophone, Anglo-Saxon,
            Anglo-American—‘Anglo-Jewish’, it will inevitably be said, if not by
            Badiou then by innumerable others, including especially the Islamic
            ‘fascists’ whose sensitivities refuse to be dulled on the point. It is,
            in any case, the positive ethnic constituency primarily identified with
            ‘the liberation of liberalism’ when this is acknowledged with coarse
            realism. No one gets to see how <em>peculiar</em> this thing is from
            nowhere. Its critics, we can confidently—if indelicately—speculate, have
            been concretely offended. They have been ‘wounded’—and not
            <em>only</em> so very recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there could be nothing more <em>gauche</em> than to
            articulate ideological criticism in the voice of national resentment.
            From the perspective of philosophy, to speak in the name of
            <em>any</em> positive identity—even one far more fashionable than the
            nation and its associated ethnic categories—is a simple disgrace.
            Selected identities might be exalted from a distance, in approximate
            proportion to their transgressive or victimological status, but every
            elite intellectual understands profoundly—if often only implicitly—that
            ontic definition is <em>dirt</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Badiou is fastidious, therefore, in avoiding all temptation to
            self-identification in less than universal terms. His ‘discursive
            position’ depends upon his identity as a proud communist, who merely
            happens to be French. There is a cost to be paid for this, in honesty—or
            realism—first of all. A necrotic collectivist utopianism does not
            constitute a plausible site of enunciation, and no one believes that it
            does. It is perhaps for this reason that Badiou refrains from quite
            closing the door onto a certain nuanced ‘patriotism’, even if his
            catastrophist narrative demands that it is held ajar only in a mode of
            nostalgia (and one that is not wholly devoid of bitterness). What France
            <em>was</em>, as a revolutionary power, is still affirmed, in a tone at
            once tragic and philosophical, drawing the requisite quantum of
            detachment from both:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="small-quote">
            <p>
              France, what is singular about France—because if there are French
              values, we must ask what is singular about them—is the revolutionary
              tradition. Republican first of all, from the ’89 revolution. And then
              socialist, anarchosyndicalist, communist, and finally leftist, all of
              this between 1789 and, let’s say, 1976. […] But all that’s over. It’s
              over. France can no longer be represented today in any credible way as
              the privileged site of a revolutionary tradition. Rather, it is
              characterised by a singular collection of identitarian intellectuals.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The surrender of France to the identitarian vice is but part of the more
            comprehensive defeat. Yet the dramatic quality of Badiou’s stance here
            should not blind us to what it evades. The French accent in what he has
            to say—both before and after this passage—extends far beyond his lament
            for the nation’s withered revolutionary vocation. The ethnic identity
            that speaks in his words encompasses, among many other things, a
            specific mode of universal aspiration, a secular faith
            ‘freed’—contemptuously—of religious trappings, and a firm confidence in
            the moral dignity of the State. There has only been one ‘revolution’ of
            the kind he inherits as a model, and it was French. It identified reason
            with revolutionary innovation—to a degree commonly found amusing beyond
            the Gallic cultural sphere, despite its menacing incarnation in an armed
            re-origination of the state, from first principles. Naturally, these
            ‘first principles’ were already a dismissal of the old religion, through
            their very originality, and also an exaltation of philosophy—as smelted
            in the flames of insurrection. They were the monsters bred from
            Descartes’s methodically exacerbated, artificial nightmare, released by
            a passage through zero (radical doubt), in which organic tradition was
            immolated upon the altar of the universal. They would—for instance—have
            decimalized time and geometry, and struggled earnestly to do so,

            French identity, radically conceived, corresponds to a failed national
            project. Is it not, <em>in fact</em>, the supreme example of collective
            defeat in the modern period, and thus—concretely—of humiliation by
            capital? It is the way the ‘alternative’ dies: locally, and
            unpersuasively, without dialectical engagement, dropping—neglected—into
            dilapidation. It can be inserted into a limited, yet not inconsiderable,
            series of identities making vehement claim to universality without
            provision of any effective criterion through which to establish it. When
            frustrated by the indifference of the outside, such objective
            pretentions tend to turn ‘fascist’ in exactly the sense Badiou employs.
            Their claims are shown—<em>demonstrably</em>—to be non-compelling beyond
            their own shrinking domain. They are ignored, so they ‘act up’. A
            certain violent madness is easily spawned. Yet it is rarely more than a
            distraction.

              capitalism. It is the absence on the global scale of this politics
              that means that a young fascist appears, is created. It is not the
              young fascist, banditry, and religion, that create the absence of a
              politics of emancipation able to construct its own vision and to
              define its own practices. It is the absence of this politics that
              creates the possibility of fascism, of banditry, and of religious

            This is Badiou’s analysis. The pin-pricks so far—and the far greater
            sufferings to come—result from an ethno-political defeat, in a long
            conflict still recalled by its stubborn survivors as a global drama of
            the Universal. It is a defeat that they imagine—or at least, still
            <em>claim</em> to imagine—might one day be undone. Who would deprive
            them of their old songs, and strange flags, and wounded dreams?

            Spite, or triumphalism, are identitarian confusions, extravagances, and
            also simply errors that <em>we</em> cannot afford. Our war is far less
            comprehensively won than theirs is lost. The adversaries that matter—<em>real fascists</em>—have controlled
            the
            commanding heights of our societies since the New
            Deal. The techno-economic dispersion of power remains radically
            incomplete. Sino-capitalism—momentarily trembling—has yet to re-make the
            world. The ‘liberation of liberalism’ has scarcely begun. None of this
            is a concern for Badiou, however, or for the Islamists. It belongs to
            another story, and—for this is the ultimate, septically enflamed
            wound—as it runs forwards, ever faster, it is not remotely theirs.

            <em>Within our bodies resides a dynamic population of microbes forming a
              symbiotic super-organism with whom we have co-evolved. Recent
              investigations indicate that these microbes majorly impact on
              cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns, such as social
              interaction and stress management. The collective microbiome comprises
              a myriad of bacteria of approximately 10^14 cells, containing 100
              times the number of genes of the human genome. Despite evolution of
              this microbiome for 500 million years, only recent advances in
              sequencing technology have allowed us to appreciate the full
              complexity of the host–microbe interrelationship. The gut microbiota
              is a highly developed organ of immense metabolic complexity and has
              approximately the same weight as the human brain. It is now clear that
              the gut microbiota plays a key role in the life and health of the host
              by protecting against pathogens, metabolizing dietary nutrients and
              drugs, and influencing the absorption and distribution of dietary fat.
              However, the influence of the microbiota extends beyond the
              gastrointestinal tract, playing a major role in the development and
              functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Among the many
              substances produced by the gut microbiota are key central
              neurotransmitters whose influence extends beyond the enteric nervous
              system to the brain.</em>

        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/on-power/">
          <h4 class="post-title">On Power</h4>
        </a>
        <p>Power is an Idea. It is exactly what it is thought to be.</p>
        <p>
          Even among pre-civilized social animals, where the temptation to confuse
          power with <em>force</em> is strongest, the need to demonstrate force is
          only sporadic, and wherever force is not continuously demonstrated,
          power has arisen.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is how dominance distinguishes itself from predation. On occasions,
          no doubt, a predator dominates its prey, convincing a struggling
          herbivore that <em>resistance is futile</em>, and its passage into
          nourishment is already, virtually, over. Even in these cases, however, a
          predator does not seek to install an enduring dominion. It matters not
          at all that its command of irresistible force be recognized beyond the
          moment of destruction. There is no social relationship to establish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-393"></span>Even the most rudimentary society requires
          something more. The economy of force has to be institutionalized, and
          power — perfectly coincident with the Idea of power — is born. When
          power is tested, driven to resort to force, or regress to it, the idea
          has already slipped, its weakness exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mere dominance has to regularly re-assert itself, rebuilding itself out
          of force. Under civilized conditions, in contrast, power is exempted
          from the test of force, and thus realizes itself consummately. It
          becomes magic and religion, perfectly identified with its apprehension,
          as a radiant assumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Power is thus profoundly paradoxical. Its truth is inextricable from a
          derealization, so that when it is practically interrogated, by forces
          determined to excavate its reality, it tends to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the force that power calls upon, when pressed to demonstrate or
          realize itself, has to be spell-bound to its idea. Will the generals
          obey? Will the soldiers shoot? It is power, and not force, that decides.
          No surprise, therefore, that power can evaporate like the snow-slopes of
          a volcano, as if instantaneously, when an eruption of force is scarcely
          more than a rumble. Power is the eruption <em>not happening</em>, far
          more than the eruption being contained. (Equally, anarchy is the
          question of power being practically posed, before it is any kind of
          ‘solution’.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To conceive economic power as wealth, is to misconstrue it as
          (rationalized) force, and thus to miss the Idea. ‘True’ economic power
          is a thoroughly derealized yet authoritative standard and store of
          value, as instantiated — exclusively — in fiat currency. Monetary signs
          that are not backed by anything beyond the ‘credit’ (or credibility) of
          the State are the tokens of pure, supremely idealized power in its
          economic form. They symbolize the effective — because untested —
          suppression of anarchy. They live through the Idea, and die with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who recognize the completion of power in an Idea, celebrants and
          antagonists alike, have no reason to object to its belated baptism as
          <em>the Cathedral</em>: our contemporary political appropriation of
          numinous authority, served by an academic, journalistic, judicial, and
          administrative clerisy, prominently including the priesthood of fiat
          adoration and financial central planning. There is no macroeconomics
          that is not Cathedral liturgy, no confidence or ‘animal spirits’
          independent of its devotions, no economic cataclysm that is not
          simultaneously a crisis of faith. A single Idea is at stake.
        </p>
        <p>
          In macroeconomics, as in politics more generally, only one
          (systematically inhibited) question remains:
          <em>Do we believe?</em> Well, do we?

          <h4 class="post-title">On Chaos</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Turbulence is nonlinear dynamism, so remarking upon it very quickly
          becomes reflexive. In any conflict, an emergent meta-conflict divides
          those who embrace and reject the conflict <em>as such</em>, and ‘meta’
          is in reality reflexivity, partially apprehended. So ignore the sides of
          the war, momentarily. What about war?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moldbug really doesn’t like it. The closest he ever comes to a
          wholly-arbitrary axiom — comparable, at least superficially, to the
          libertarian Non-Aggression Principle — is exhibited in this context.
          Following some preliminary remarks, his first
          <a
            href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html">exposition</a>
          of the formalist ideology begins: “The basic idea of formalism is just
          that the main problem in human affairs is violence.” As with Hobbes, the
          horror of war is the foundation of political philosophy.
        </p>
        <p><span id="more-2495"></span></p>
        <p>
          This is by no means a trivial decision. With avoidance of war identified
          as the fundamental principle of political order, an ultimate criterion
          of (secular) value is erected, in simultaneity with a framework of
          genetic and structural explanation. Good government is defined as an
          effective process of pacification, attaining successively more
          highly-tranquilized
          <a
            href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2009/07/secession-liberty-and-dictatorship.html">levels</a>
          (and stages) of order:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>… there are four levels of sovereign security. These are peace,
            order, law, and freedom. Once you have each one, you can work on the
            next. But it makes no sense to speak of order without peace, law
            without order, or freedom without law.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>Peace is simply the absence of war. The Dictator’s first goal is to
            achieve peace, preferably honorably and with victory. There is no
            telling what wars New California will be embroiled in at the time of
            its birth, so I will decline to discuss the matter further. But in
            war, of course, there is no order; war is pure chaos. Thus we see our
            first rule of hierarchy.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this model order and chaos are strictly reciprocal. Suppression of
          chaos and establishment of order are alternative, inter-changeable
          formulations of the same basic political reality. There is no
          productivity proper to government other than the ‘good war’ directed
          against the Cthulhu-current of chaos, violence, conflict, turmoil, and
          inarticulate anarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          No surprise, then, that widespread dismay results from outbreaks of
          conflict across the digital tracts of neoreaction. How could any Moldbug
          sympathizer — or other right-oriented observer — not recognize in these
          skirmishes the signs of anarcho-chaotic disturbance, as if the diseased
          tentacles of Cthulhu were insinuated abominably into the refuge of
          well-ordered sociability? Beyond the protagonists themselves, such
          scraps trigger a near-universal clamor for immediate and unconditional
          peace: Forget about who is right and who wrong,
          <em>the conflict itself is wrong</em>.
        </p>
        <p>I don’t think so.</p>
        <p>
          Entropy is toxic, but
          <em>entropy production is roughly
            <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf">synonymous</a>
            with
            <a
              href="http://www.ted.com/talks/alex_wissner_gross_a_new_equation_for_intelligence/transcript">intelligence</a></em>.
          A dynamically innovative order, of any kind, does not suppress the
          production of entropy — it instantiates an efficient mechanism for
          entropy dissipation. Any quasi-Darwinian system — i.e. any machinery
          that actually works — is nourished by chaos, exactly insofar as it is
          able to rid itself of failed experiments. The techno-commercial critique
          of democratized modernity is not that too much chaos is tolerated, but
          that not enough is able to be shed. The problem with bad government,
          which is to say with <em>defective mechanisms of selection</em>, is an
          inability to follow
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/cthulhu-leftist/">Cthulhu</a> far
          enough. It is from turbulence that all things come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question <em>Outside in</em> would pose to NRx is not ‘how can we
          suppress chaos?’ but rather ‘how can we learn to tolerate chaos at a far
          higher intensity?’ Dynamic order is not built deliberately upon a
          foundation of amicable fraternity. It emerges spontaneously as a
          consequence of effective entropy-dissipation functions. The primary
          requirement is <em>sorting</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To <em>sort ourselves out</em> takes a chronic undertow of war and
          chaos. Initially, this will be provided by the soft and peripheral
          shadow-fights we have already seen, but eventually NRx will be strong
          enough to thrive upon cataclysms — or it will die. The harsh machinery
          of Gnon wins either way.

            Most likely you're reducing the political to the biological, a typical
            kind of reductionism but also mistaken.

          The error of mistaking this expert hooting for the first step in an
          argument was too tempting to resist. After all, if a professor of Global
          Liberal Studies deigns to teach you about the limits of possible
          biological understanding, it is only polite to listen attentively.
          Unfortunately, certain monkey juices were triggered by the
          chest-thumping of GLS-prof., and I descended quickly into
          obstreperousness:

            Politics has emergent principles (game theory), but it's as reducible
            to biology as bio is to chemistry.

          A piece of machinery that
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine">reduces</a>
          (local) disorder has value. It might be a functional police force, a
          catallactic economic arrangement, or a sociopolitical mechanism
          implementing dynamic geography (or Patchwork,

          Others might be listed. Any complex adaptive
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">system</a>
          works like this (until it ceases working). Since
          <a href="http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf">Schrödinger</a>, it has been taken as an
          abstract definition of life. In certain
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Schizophrenia">strands</a>
          of philosophy, it has also been taken as the complete, rigorous meaning
          of a <em>machine</em> (as counterposed to a ‘gadget’ – which works only
          within a larger machinic assemblage). Only by exporting entropy does
          anything of even minimal complexity get to continue its existence. The
          production of order is functionality in its most elevated, teleological
          sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          A piece of rhetoric which merely celebrates order, as something nice to
          have, is worth nothing in itself. “We want order” is the “give us free
          stuff” slogan of intellectually degenerated reaction. When examined
          closely, it is indistinguishable from political pan-handling. (Democracy
          has taught everyone how to beg.) It is unlikely that even the most
          radically degraded libertarian would be shameless enough to consider
          “wealth is good, poverty is bad” anything more than an expression of
          sub-comic emotional incontinence. “Order is good, chaos is bad” is a
          slogan of exactly equivalent merit. “We want order” is just “we want
          money” at a superior level of generality. Monkeys want peanuts, but we
          are reluctant to dignify their hungry hooting with the label ‘political
          philosophy’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entropy dissipation is a <em>problem</em>. It might quite reasonably be
          considered <em>the</em> problem. Any serious social theory is respected
          insofar as it elicits the question:
          <em>So how is entropy dissipated?</em> The main current of Anglophone
          intellectual culture focuses tightly upon it, in a broad lineage from
          Newtonian mechanics, the Scottish Enlightenment, the science of heat,
          classical economics, and Darwinian naturalism, into theories of
          complexity, distributed systems, dynamic networks, and productive
          multiplicities. <em>Spontaneous order</em> is the consistent topic.
          ‘Spontaneous’ means only:
          <em>Does not presuppose that which it is tasked with explaining</em>. If
          the genesis of order is not being theorized, order is merely being
          assumed, and then consumed. The difference is between a supply side
          problematic (“how is order practically produced?”) and an empty demand
          (“we want more order”). The former is <em>industrial</em>, the latter
          simply tyrannical, when it is anything at all beside vacuous noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless a pol-econ. theory can contribute to an explanation of the
          <em>production of order</em> (dissipation of entropy), it is wasting
          everyone’s time. “But I really <em>want</em> order” is just silliness.
          It’s astounding that it could ever be thought otherwise.

          There has been enough productive history to know what functional social
          systems look like, and the basic common factor is obvious. Institutions
          advance by <em>substituting for trust</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (To the extent we still have any of these things …)<br />
          — We have market capitalism because businesspeople can’t be trusted.<br />
          — We have experimental science because neither truth intuitions nor
          scientists can be trusted.<br />
          — We have constitutional republicanism because neither political leaders
          nor the citizenry can be trusted.<br />
          — We have freedom of conscience because priests can’t be trusted.<br />
          — We have common law because neither legislators nor judges can be
          trusted.<br />
          — We have the blogosphere because the media can’t be trusted.<br />
          — We have gold coins buried in the garden because bankers can’t be
          trusted.<br />
          — We have basements packed with semi-automatic rifles because state law
          enforcement can’t be trusted.

          Siding with intelligence <em>has nothing at all to</em> do with
          trusting, liking, or respecting intelligent people. It is intelligent
          people, typically, who run the engines of stupidity. ‘<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but<br />
            verify</a>‘ is politely euphemistic, and — in truth — wholly inadequate.
          Distrust, and test, test, test … to destruction wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three theses:<br />
          (1) The robust sophistication (or design quality) of any society or
          social institution is inversely proportional to the the trust it
          demands. This is not, of course, to be confused with the trust it
          <em>earns</em>.<br />
          (2) In any society capable of institution building, distrust is the
          principal driver of innovation. Systematization and automation, in
          general, incarnate distrust.<br />
          (3) Productive distrust reaches its apotheosis in the Internet, which
          routes around everything and everybody that has ever been believed.

          <em>The proposed
            <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/venice-votes-break-rest-italy-article-1.1730223">“Repubblica
              Veneta”</a>
            would embrace five million inhabitants of Veneto. Should it succeed in
            seceding, Lombardy and Trentino would likely follow, bringing about a
            partition of Italy. Sardinia is also reportedly looking for an
            exit.</em>

          Buchanan’s preferred term ‘nationalism’ is ambiguous in this context,
          since it can mean either integration or disintegration. After all, it
          was Italian ‘nationalism’ that built this self-dismantling monster.
          Increasingly, it’s the fissile aspect — nationality as ethnic
          splintering and <em>escape</em> from something larger — that’s driving
          the process. How many micro-nationalities remain as yet undiscovered?

          Internet retro-futurism is taken to a whole new
          <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/osi-the-internet-that-wasnt">level</a>
          by Andrew L. Russell:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What happened to the “beautiful dream” [of Open Systems
            Interconnection]? While the Internet’s triumphant story has been well
            documented by its designers and the historians they have worked with,
            OSI has been forgotten by all but a handful of veterans of the
            Internet-OSI standards wars. To understand why, we need to dive into
            the early history of computer networking, a time when the vexing
            problems of digital convergence and global interconnection were very
            much on the minds of computer scientists, telecom engineers,
            policymakers, and industry executives. And to appreciate that history,
            you’ll have to set aside for a few minutes what you already know about
            the Internet. Try to imagine, if you can, that the Internet never
            existed. …</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The article is rich enough to support a number of take-away lessons. The
          most compelling from the perspective of this blog: the real benefits of
          bypassing discussion are huge. We got a TCP/IP Internet because OSI was
          discussing the future far too widely and comprehensively. The route that
          avoids the talking shop is the one history tends to take.

        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/distrust/">
          <h4 class="post-title">Distrust</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          <strong>Every <em>public</em> institution of any value is based on
            distrust</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s an elementary proposition, as far as this blog is concerned. It’s
          worth stating nakedly, since it is probably less obvious to others. That
          much follows from it is unlikely to be controversial, even among those
          who find it less than compelling, or simply repulsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          One major source of obscurity is the category of ‘high trust cultures’ —
          with which neoreactionaries tend naturally to identify. There is plenty
          to puzzle over here, admittedly. This post will make no serious effort
          to even scratch the surface of the questions that arise. Instead, it
          contends that the culture primarily commended for its trustfulness has
          been conspicuously innovative in the development of trustless
          institutions. These begin with the foundations of Occidental reason, and
          especially the rigorous criterion of logical and mathematical
          <em>proof</em>. A proof substitutes for trust. In place of a simple
          declaration, it presents (a demanded) <em>demonstration</em>. The
          <em>compliant response to radical distrust</em> has epitomized Western
          conceptions of rationality since classical antiquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-4289"></span>The twin pillars of industrial modernity
          (i.e. of capitalism) are trustless institutions. Natural science is
          experimental because it is distrustful, and thus demonstrative. It
          raises the classical demand for proof to a higher level of empirical
          skepticism, by extending distrust even to rational constructions, in
          cases where they cannot be critically tested against an experimental
          criterion. Only pure mathematics, and the most scrupulously formalized
          logical propositions, escape this demand for replicable
          <em>evidence</em>. The ultimate ground of the natural scientific
          enterprise is the presupposition that
          <em>scientists should in no case be trusted</em>, except through their
          reproducible results. Anything that requires <em>belief</em> is not
          science, but something else. Similarly, the market mechanism is an
          incarnation of trustless social organization. <em>Caveat emptor</em>.
          Capitalists, like scientists, exist to be distrusted. Whatever of their
          works cannot survive testing to destruction in the market place
          deservedly perish. Reputation, in its modern version, has to be produced
          through demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to its demotic ruination — through positive trust in the people —
          distinctively modern republican governance was similarly founded in
          distrust. As formulated by John Adams (1772): “There is danger from all
          men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man
          living with power to endanger the public liberty.” It has not been an
          excess of distrust that has brought this sage recommendation to nought.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those seeking higher authority, Psalm 118:8-9 (ESV): “It is better
          to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man. It is better to take
          refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.” (My usual fanatical trust
          in the KJV betrayed me on this occasion.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An appeal for trust is a reliably fatal failure mode for all public
          institutions. Trustless transaction is the future, and its name is
          <a href="http://www.thebitcoinsociety.org/content/bitcoin-beauty-trustless-transactions">Bitcoin</a>. The deep
          cultural momentum is already familiar.
          <em>Total depravity</em> is the key to world historical predestination,
          and it is routed through the blockchain.

          Anybody who is trying to build institutions today, of whatever kind*,
          would be wise to immerse themselves in the way this stuff works. It will
          take time to shape the order of the world, but it isn’t going away. The
          same can very much <em>not</em> be said for the nation states of the
          Gutenberg Era, whose recession is already unmistakable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virtually speaking, there is nothing serious left for the Westphalian
          state to do. Of course, anybody expecting these relics to die tidily is
          almost certainly deluding themselves. Making the Westphalian order set
          the world to the torch. Its unmaking is unlikely to be much easier.

        <p>
          <em>Basically, we assume that market relations are natural, but you need
            a huge institutional structure to make people behave the way that
            economists say they are “supposed” to behave. So, for example, think
            about the way the consumer market works. The market is supposed to
            work on grounds of pure competition. Nobody has moral ties to each
            other other than to obey the rules. But, on the other hand, people are
            supposed to do anything they can to get as much as possible off the
            other guy — but won’t simply steal the stuff or shoot the person.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>Historically, that’s just silly; if you don’t care at all about a
            guy, you might as well steal his stuff. In fact, they’re encouraging
            people to act essentially how most human societies, historically,
            treated their enemies — but to still never resort to violence,
            trickery or theft. Obviously that’s not going to happen. You can only
            do that if you set up a very strictly enforced police force.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the absence of a moral bond, who’s going to stick to the rules, when

            analysed and boosted support for the European “project”. Almost all of
            its practitioners have proceeded from the assumption that the process
            of integration is – must be – “irreversible”. It is the intellectual
            equivalent of the principle of the European

            surrendered or pooled, cannot be retrieved. Or, more unkindly, one
            might see it as a “European Brezhnev doctrine”, by which socialism,

          <em>Bitcoin is not a Marxist reification. Bitcoin reifies in the rare
            sense of ‘<strong>ex nihilo</strong>, actually create a physical
            object’. <strong>Bitcoin reifies property</strong>. Property before
            bitcoin is an abstraction, a social relation treated provisionally as
            an object, but never attaining that status (<strong>Property is Impossible</strong>). Bitcoin quite
            literally
            makes property into something physical.
            Anything that can store a private key and keep it secret, and can use
            it to create and emit transactions, can own Bitcoin. The relation ‘X
            owns Bitcoin’ is spatially local and temporally persistent; in other
            words, it more closely resembles relations like ‘X is made of wood’ or
            ‘X weighs 20 kilograms’ than it does relations like ‘X is a dollar
            billionaire’. Property is possible — when property is Bitcoin.</em>

          When a proposition nation serves as the global model of the state, such
          discriminations are easily blurred. The underlying stresses have become
          far more visible recently. (Language figures, ironically doubled, in the
          irruption of ‘excessive’ national questions.)

          unpleasantness, the problem was eclipsed. We can now see, however, that

          Xenosystems likes proposition nations so much it wants to see a
          <em>lot</em> more of them.

          America is a problem for the world for two main (and conflicting)
          reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          1) Its proposition contains enough productive innovation to be scary.
          Independence war, foundational liberalism, constitutionally-restricted
          government, and <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism have been a
          memetic-cocktail-from-hell for those in thrall to competitively-inferior
          ideas. But, undoing all of this, is the legacy of the American Civil War
          (in particular) —
        </p>
        <p>
          2) The suppression of the propositional principle — i.e. geopolitical
          ideological sorting — under an idealization of national unity. Upon this
          pyre the liberal tradition has been incinerated, until it exists only as
          a charred parody of itself. The Proposition is by now little more than
          the State of the Union. Mandatory agreement, within an undivided
          territory, is policed by the democratic mechanism.
          <em>That we remain one</em> is left as the only strictly axiomatic
          propositional content (as the Trump and Sanders presidential candidacies
          in their different ways illustrate).
        </p>
        <p>
          Spatial Metapolitics recommends that America do <em>both</em> Trumpist
          ethno-nationalism, <em>and</em> Sanderista democratic socialism, and a
          large number of other (more interesting) things, even also more stupid
          ones, if such can be devised. The critical point is the precise inverse
          of the late-modern axiom:
          <em>As long as mandatory unity is dissolved, ideological tolerance can be
            extended without definite limit</em>
          — across a disintegrated territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          First-order ideological preferences, elaborated under an assumption of
          dominant unity, are a trap
          <em>entirely irrespective of their specific content</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a proposition: <em>Abolish the Union.</em> Only disintegration is
          worth doing.

          According to a certain construction of cultural history, to which the
          natural sciences have often seemed attached, religion is essentially
          conceived as pre-scientific naturalistic explanation. Seen this way,
          religions are comparatively primitive cosmologies. This is what makes
          them vulnerable to scientific progress. A Galileo, or a Darwin, advances
          into their core territory, mortally wounding them in the heart. A
          somewhat sociologically-indistinct notion of “science” is envisaged as
          religion’s natural successor.
        </p>
        <p>
          However plausible (or implausible) this narrative is found to be, it
          matters. By way of it, scientific ascendancy acquires its foundational
          myth. Crucially, this mythical power does not depend upon any kind of
          rigorous scientific validation. No one has ever been under compulsion to
          put it to the test. Everything pre-modern — and even profoundly archaic
          — in the modernist enterprise runs through it. It provides a tacit
          infrastructure of deep belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          To refer to “mythic science” is not positively skeptical, still less
          polemical. For scientific ideas to acquire the status of myth is a
          matter of cultural potency, supplementary to whatever epistemic validity
          they retain. Scientific concepts do not become any less scientific by
          also becoming mythic. They can, however, on occasions sustain mythic
          power disproportionate to their strictly scientific legitimacy. The
          dominating apex of a culture is some more-or-less scientific cosmology.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what the word “nature” has primordially conveyed. An ultimate
          object of cognitive affirmation is promoted through it.
          <i>This is what we believe</i>. Things are this way, and not another way
          (or only another way elsewhere).
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask here, then, as innocent scientific pagans:
          <i>Which way are things?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The best current cosmology is accelerationist, and disintegrationist. To
          put the matter crudely — and ultimately untenably — the expansion of the
          universe is speeding up, and apart. Rather than being decelerated by
          gravity, subsequent to an original explosion, the rate of cosmic
          inflation has increased. Some yet-unknown force is overwhelming gravity,
          and red-shifting all distant objects. Quite recently baptized “dark
          energy,” this force is thought to account for<a
            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/05/03/cosmologys-biggest-conundrum-is-a-clue-not-a-controversy/#293d00cb78ea">
            seventy percent of physical reality</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to this strongly confirmed discovery of accelerating
          fragmentation, the notion of an underlying integral “universe” looks
          increasingly like an unsustainable mythological relic. “Unsustainable,”
          that is, even in terms of consistent scientific myth, and also more
          practically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The distance from which information can be received, or to which it can
          be broadcast, over any period of time has a boundary set by the speed of
          light. The space-time horizon of reality for any entity is determined by
          this “light-cone.” Beyond it, there is only the absolutely
          incommunicable. A light-cone is thus, among other things, a strict
          delimitation of power projection, understood as practical unity. The
          process leads from general relativity to absolute disintegration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his intellectual history of relativistic physics,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
          Peter Gallison connects the problem of relativity to that of imperial
          management. Synchronization is the precondition for any sophisticated
          process of coordination. Even under (compact) terrestrial conditions,
          the extreme finitude of the speed of light posed a significant technical
          problem for governance at global-imperial scale. Telegraphic networks,
          in particular, demanded technical correction for relativistic effects.

          By irresistible extrapolation, we can see that domination is only ever
          able to mask processes of escape. There can be no Cosmic Imperium. Space
          does not tolerate it. This is merely a science fictionesque fact, until
          it is mythologized.

          Dark energy is tearing the cosmos apart. Eventually its pieces will
          mutually depart from each others’ light-cones. They will then be nothing
          to each other ever again. This is a finding of extraordinary
          consequence. At the greatest scale of empirical objectivity, unity has
          no future. The “universe” is an unrealistic model. Everything now known
          about the cosmos suggests that fragmentation is basic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cosmology thus provides a model of disintegration that is remarkable for
          its extremity. It characterizes pieces that have nothing at all except a
          shared past in common, propelled into absolute non-communication. No
          political conception of separation has ever yet reached this limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some fascinating results quickly fall out of the extrapolation. The
          cosmological evidence our scientific tradition has been able to draw
          upon will eventually cease to be available. A future intelligent species
          could not build any comparable model of the universe upon empirical
          foundations. Whatever counted as the whole, for it, would in fact be
          only a fragment (we can already see). Distant galactic clusters would
          have become matters for sheer speculation. The very possibility of
          empirical science would have been demonstrably bounded in space and
          time.

          <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/2017/02/the-coming-amnesia/">calls it</a>
          “the coming amnesia.” He remarks on a talk by science fiction writer
          Alastair Reynolds:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            As the universe expands over hundreds of billions of years, Reynolds
            explained, there will be a point, in the very far future, at which all
            galaxies will be so far apart that they will no longer be visible from
            one another. […] Upon reaching that moment, it will no longer be
            possible to understand the universe’s history—or perhaps even that it
            had one—as all evidence of a broader cosmos outside of one’s own
            galaxy will have forever disappeared. Cosmology itself will be
            impossible. […] In such a radically expanded future universe, Reynolds
            continued, some of the most basic insights offered by today’s
            astronomy will be unavailable. After all, he points out, ‘you can’t
            measure the redshift of galaxies if you can’t see galaxies. And if you
            can’t see galaxies, how do you even know that the universe is
            expanding? How would you ever determine that the universe had had an
            origin?’
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Reynolds was drawing upon an article entitled “The End of Cosmology?” by
          Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert J. Scherrer, published in Scientific
          American (2008). This article summarized itself in the sub-head: “An
          accelerating universe wipes out traces of its own origins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The extrapolation can be pushed further. If a far-future scientific
          culture can be seen to be structurally-deprived of evidence essential
          for realistic appraisal of cosmic scale, can we be confident our
          situation is fundamentally different? Is it not more probable that the
          absolute or unsurpassable locality of scientific perspective is a basic
          situation? How likely is it that we can see universally — in principle —
          when we can already see how others will in the future be unable to? On
          the basis of available evidence, we have to envisage a future
          civilization that is utterly deluded about its own structural
          parochialism, confident in its ability to finally shrug off perspectival
          limitation. The most esteemed scientific minds in such a culture might
          be expected to dismiss any suggestion of inaccessible cosmic regions as
          groundless metaphysics. It seems merely hubristic to refrain from
          turning this scenario back upon ourselves. If universal cosmology is to
          become impossible, the default hypothesis should be that it already
          has.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Natural science exhibits a tragic structure. Pursuing only its own
          essential methods, it finds — through cosmology — a compelling case for
          its large-scale unreliability. The acquisition of universal insight
          through rigorous empirical investigation appears cosmically obstructed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Science is thus eventually bound to be fundamentally localized. The
          “locality” at issue here is not merely the weak particularism of an
          option taken against the global, or universal. Rather, it is the very
          horizon of any possible universalistic ambition that finds itself
          rigorously constricted, and dismantled. Localism, thus understood, is
          not a choice, but a destiny, and even a fatality already imposed. At its
          greatest scales, reality is shattered. Unity exists only to be broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle of isotropy holds that there are no privileged
          orientations in space. Together with the presumption of the homogeneity
          of space, it composes the Cosmological Principle. We are surely entitled
          to an isochronic analog, in which a fate observable in the order of time
          can be assumed equally to already be behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a cosmos still, and perennially, then, but no longer a universe.
          The cosmos we, as moderns, subscribe to under cultural obligation is in
          fact the manifest disintegration of the apparent universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our topic gears down from inflationary cosmology through thermodynamics.
          We are talking of diversification, or <i>heterogenesis</i>, after all –
          and that is the rigorous negative of entropy increase. Homogenization is
          entropy. The two concepts are not strictly distinguishable. What was
          discovered under the name of entropy was the destruction of difference —
          whether variation in temperature (Clausius and Carnot) or, later,
          variation in particle distribution (Boltzmann and Gibbs). Heterogenesis
          is local, the second law of thermodynamics tells us. At the truly global
          level – where no inputs or outputs can occur – deterioration necessarily
          prevails.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get ahead of ourselves, we will find that the West has made of
          entropy a God, One whose final law is that everything shall be the same.
          It is a false god. The ultimate cosmo-physical problem –
          <i>How is negative entropy possible?</i> – attests to that. We know that
          heterogenesis is no weaker than its opposite, even if we do not know
          how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cosmological disintegration is more widely echoed among the natural
          sciences. Perhaps most importantly, <i>The Origin of Species</i> has
          disintegration as its basic topic, as its name already underscores.
          Darwinism — which is to say the whole of scientific biology — has
          speciation as its primary object, and speciation is splitting.

          Despite recognition of various exotic lateral connections, from
          symbioses to retroviral genomic insertions, it is the divergence of
          genetic lineages that best defines life at the largest scales. Meldings
          are anomalous, and in any case impossible unless diversity has first
          been produced. The ingredients of any heterogeneous coalition presume
          prior diversification.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Disintegrationism in the biological sciences amounts to a science in
          itself, named cladistics.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
          Cladistics formalizes the method of rigorous Darwinian classification.
          The identity of any biological type is determined by the particular
          series of schismatic events it has passed through. To be human is to be
          a primate, a mammal, a reptile, a bony fish, and a vertebrate, among
          other, more basic, classes. The sum of what you have broken from defines
          what you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          A “clade” is a shard. It is a group, of any scale, determined by
          secession from a lineage. The point of differentiation between clades
          corresponds to their most recent (i.e. last) common ancestor. Crucially,
          therefore, all descendants of a clade belong to that clade, which
          encompasses any number of sub-clades. The production of subclades
          (origin of species) is called “radiation.” It tends to proceed through
          serial bifurcation, since simultaneous complex cladistic fragmentation
          events are comparatively exotic. Successive simple branchings typically
          capture diversification. The stakes of it not doing so are not huge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cladistics can be identified with a rigorization of taxonomic
          nomenclature. A system of names writes a cladogram, which is to say a
          model of evolutionary history, and of biological relatedness. Any
          cladogram is an evolutionary hypothesis. It proposes a particular order
          of splitting. Any such proposed order is empirically revisable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cladistics maps the whole of disintegrationism below the cosmological
          level, and perhaps even up to it. Naturally, it is supremely
          controversial. The full scope of its provocation has yet to be
          understood. Insofar as cladistics is explanatory, however, much follows.
          Notably, identity is conceived as essentially schismatic, and being is
          apprehended fundamentally as a structure of inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historical linguistics fell naturally into a cladistic mode. Linguistic
          ‘families’ shared essential characteristics with their biological
          template. They proliferated by sub-division, providing the material for
          a classification schema. It was upon this linguistic taxonomy that
          racial groupings were first systematically determined. The “Yamnaya” —
          still today more widely known as “Aryans” — were originally identified
          through the cladistics of Indo-European languages. Their pattern of
          radiation was marked by a tree-like linguistic diversification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Differential anthropology was drawn in cladograms. Trees, phylogenetic
          order, language families, genealogies, actual (massively extended)
          families — it was all extremely coherent. Here, too, phenomena of
          fusion, lateral cross-contamination, and convergence — while by no means
          absent — were evidently secondary and derivative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linguistic diversification looks like a process of schismatic
          ethnogenesis. As peoples branch out, they mutually differentiate. The
          origin of peoples is only origin of species at higher resolution — the
          abstract pattern is the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concrete mechanism of speciation typically involves the isolation of
          populations, and in this way becomes — very recently — political. There
          is a politics of “invasive species” and anthropic bio-dispersal, but
          this is not especially rancorous, or significantly polarizing. The case
          of human population isolation is very different. During this process of
          politicization, the exogamic radicalism of North-West European
          populations has been sublimed into a universal ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the subject of race tends to produce extreme ideological and
          emotional disturbance today, it might be preferable to consider
          variegated domestic animals, as the English naturalistic tradition was
          inclined to do. Not only sound analogy but also balance, or true
          moderation is to be found in doing so. Since, in our contemporary
          cultural context the influence of country life has notably receded, and
          with it the sense of vivid distinction among cultivated species, dogs
          serve us as by far the most illustrative examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          A world without mongrels would be a poorer world. Mongrels are often
          advantaged by special and even superior qualities. The Golden Doodle,
          for instance, is as exalted as any canine type that exists. Such crosses
          add to the diversity of the world. This is fully consistent with a basic
          process through which the world is enriched by diverging dog breeds, in
          which “dogs in general” is an increasingly uninformative category. There
          is not – yet – any ideology directed to global canine genetic
          homogenization.

          Diversity is good, which is to say <i>robust</i>, and
          <i>innovative</i> (at least). The ecological consensus can be trusted in
          this regard. Invasive species are detested because they lower diversity,
          not because they raise it. Heterogenesis is at all times the superior
          ambition. Yet diversification — the production of diversity — is a
          peculiarly neglected topic in our contemporary social sciences. The
          mantra of diversity is coupled with almost complete indifference, and
          even strategic negligence, in this regard. Obligatory public celebration
          of diversity accompanies, and covers, its programmatic practical
          extirpation. Mankind, it has been authoritatively decided, is one, and
          destined only to be ever more so. Genetic partition is today considered
          tantamount to a human-rights violation.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

          Our supreme orthodoxy is that it would be terrible almost beyond
          contemplation not to already be and become yet more One. We might be
          tempted to call this faith monohumanism. That mankind shall be a unity
          is its fundamental doctrine. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that
          this is far less an empirical observation than a moral and political
          project, in which racial entropy has been elevated to a sacred
          obligation. The radical — as opposed to merely conservative —
          alternative to this vision is found only in science fiction.<a href="#_ftn6"

          Preservation of human diversity is a staple of dissident ethnopolitics,
          with “Beige World” increasingly perceived as a coercive ideal. A
          typically inchoate resistance to racial entropy is the central
          mobilizing factor in such cases, though one regrettably afflicted by an
          immoderate fetishization of mandatory racial purity. At worst – and not
          uncommonly – this reaction against monohumanism has come to see all
          contributions to human genetic diversity through racial crossing as an
          avatar of coercive homogenization. The balanced response, to repeat the
          lesson of the dogs, is that a world of tendential speciation or
          increasing genetic diversity is by no compelling necessity a world
          hostile to mutts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last 60,000 years, human genetic divergence has been
          overwhelmingly the dominant process. Conspicuous fragmentation of modern
          humans into genetically distinct sub-species has been the basic pattern.
          It is a process worthy of ecological celebration, and even
          techno-industrial acceleration. Despite the fondest hopes of the present
          secular church, there is no chance it will be terminally dispelled.

          “Globalism” is a word that, while ideologically contested, is of
          uncontested ideological weight. It might be defined, with minimal
          tendentiousness, as seeking the direction of policy from a perspective
          in accordance with the whole. Stubbornly partial orientations are its
          enemies. Yet such has been its triumph that — even in the face of recent
          set-backs — hostility is peculiarly drowned in condescension.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Parochialism” is among the slurs globalism finds prepared to its
          convenience. It might accept an inability to see universally as
          understandable, and educable. A refusal of universalistic perspective,
          however, can merit no such sympathy. It is, for the globalist,
          essentially unethical. Parochialism is less to be argued against than
          simply scorned. It is to be despised in the name of the universal —
          which is becoming amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever we have seen as the death of God is only a special case of
          universality’s more comprehensive demise. While God’s death was mostly
          inferred, the death of the universal unfolds as an explicit scientific
          spectacle. Astrophysics sees the universe being dismantled before its
          artificial eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The globalist camp is especially prone to gesticulations of piety in
          respect to the idea of science. It is ironic therefore that — in
          scientific terms — globalism looks increasingly like an untenable
          religion. Its intrinsic cosmology is an archaic myth. It could not
          easily be more obvious that there is no universe, outside this
          mythological structure. The fundamental nature of the cosmos is to go
          its separate ways.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[7]</sup></a>

          Pieces are basic. To conceive them following from wholes is confusion,
          produced by unsustainable universalistic frames. Any perspective that
          can actually be realized has already been localized by serial breakages.
          Nothing begins with the whole, unless as illusion. Today, we know this
          both empirically and transcendentally. Anything not done in pieces is
          not done in profound accordance with reality.

            orientation of cladistics could not be more unflinching. The word
            ‘clade’ is taken from the Greek clados, meaning branch. A cladogram is
            an abstract tree. Its articulations are all branchings. Deleuze &amp;
            Guattari’s critical engagement with it has been highly influential.
            They tell us they are “bored of trees.” The alternative to
            arborescence, they propose, is the rhizome — a network in which every
            node connects to every other. Appropriately, the ‘rhizome’ is not
            itself a taxonomic concept, but a morphological one. The balanced
            position is to acknowledge that evolutionary trees are complemented by
            ecological webs. Neither is conceivable without the other. The
            evolutionary tree is pruned and trained within ecologies of lateral
            relations. Phylogeny is overwhelmingly tree-like, while ontogeny
            involves far more lateral influence. We will limit ourselves here,
            with cryptic brevity, to remarking that Deleuzoguattarian rhizomatics

            to three (comparatively exotic) varieties of tree like descent. The
            first is an odd thought experiment that need not distract us even
            momentarily here. The second concerns his mind-clone “ems.” This is of
            potential relevance to a range of potential, and even already actual
            software lineages. The third is the structure of the quantum
            multiverse. It suggests that a tree-like cosmology arises on paths
            quite different from that pursued here. He notes: ” … a quantum
            history is in part a tree of observers. Each observer in this tree can
            look backward and see a chain of branches back to the root, with each
            branch holding a version of themselves. More versions of themselves
            live in other branches of this tree.”</span>

            a Darwinian multiverse, selecting for reproductive fitness through the
            production of black holes. It might be described as a
            cladistically-structured multiverse, were this label not so much more
            widely applicable. Cladistic multiverses belong to the much larger set
            of cladistically-structured entities, whose parts are characterized
            by:</span>

          <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Such multiverses predict their own imperceptibility. Since parallel
            branches are mutually non-communicating, it is to be expected that
            their existence is strictly theoretical. If the multiverse was a

          Does ideological space make more sense when depicted as a triangle
          (rather than a line or quadrant)? It certainly helps to explain the room
          for controversy on the ‘extreme right’. Having Darwin out there beyond
          the edge of the ideologically-thinkable makes a lot of sense, too.

          <h4 class="post-title">Right and Left</h4>
        </a>
        <p>
          Endless conversational stimulation is to be found in the fact that the
          most basic distinction of modern politics is profoundly
          incomprehensible, and at the same time almost universally invested.
          Almost everybody thinks they understand the difference between the Right
          and the Left, until they think about it. Then they realize that this
          distinction commands no solid consensus, and exists primarily as a
          substitute for thought. Perhaps the same is true of all widely-invoked
          political labels. Perhaps that is what politics is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spandrell directs a winding, intermittently brilliant
          <a href="https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/the-rightist-singularity/">post</a>
          to the topic, which is enriched by a comments thread of outstanding
          quality. Like the Right/Left distinction itself, the argument becomes
          increasingly confusing, the closer it is examined. The ‘rightist
          singularity’ of the title is introduced as a real political alternative
          to the Left Singularity modeled by James Donald, driven by analogous
          self-reinforcing feedback dynamics, but into nationalistic rather than
          egalitarian catastrophe. For societies menaced by the prospect of Left
          Singularity, it offers an alternative path. China is taking it,
          Spandrell suggests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-545"></span>Notably, in passing, Spandrell’s gloss on
          Donald’s Left Singularity is a gem:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The leftist singularity is based on claiming higher status by being
            more egalitarian than anyone else. So you get a status arms race in
            which everyone tries to be more egalitarian than the others. That
            works because people (and monkeys) take equality to be a good
            thing.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          (To continue, we have to bracket the ‘old’ Right Singularity: the
          Technocommercial Singularity that Donald’s formula for Left Singularity
          distinguished itself from. Nobody even mentions it in this discussion.
          It’s a problem for some other time.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To backtrack from these digressions: If ‘rightist singularity’ is
          nationalistic, that aligns the Right with nationalism, doesn’t it? But
          nothing remotely this crude is sustainable (not when time is involved),
          Spandrell notes: “the Right isn’t nationalist any more.” He expands,
          convincingly, in his own comment thread:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What historically has been called Right was about law and order, i.e.
            leaving things as they are. Tribalism qua nationalism isn’t inherently
            “Rightist”, in fact originally it was a Leftist subversive meme
            against the Ancient Regime, but when mass media was invented
            nationalism was the status quo, i.e. the Right, and political labels
            have become fossilized since.</em>
        </p>
        <p>As Vladimir (May 25, 22:10) articulates the point:</p>
        <p>
          <em>Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn would have a ready answer for you:
            nationalism <strong>is</strong> leftism. It is basically another name
            for Jacobinism. These paradoxes of right-wing nationalism are just
            another manifestation of the fundamental problem of modern rightism —
            namely, that a large part of its content is just yesterday’s leftism
            that the left has in the meantime abandoned for a more extreme left
            position.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>So, I’d say this is nothing but just another mode of leftist
            singularity.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, Spandrell again (May 26, 02:34): “Historical evidence is that
          nationalism was leftist before socialism appeared further left, making
          it rightist.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Right is yesterday’s Left, or at least, it is soon exposed as such
          when it appears in its historical and populist guise. When the masses
          turn Right, they are defending a dated Left, frozen in place by
          modernist mass media memory, stuck in a black-and-white newsreel, like
          an insect in amber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The squirming is over, unless it changes dimensions. Then chaos yawns,
          despite heroic efforts to restore order (Baker, May 25 17:29; Handle May
          25 18:33; Den Beste
          <a href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/05/LeftandRight.shtml">linked</a>
          by Peter Taylor May 27 17:47), with Moldbug’s preferred Order and Chaos
          spectrum sucked — among innumerable others — into the vortex. Tradition
          and revolution, authority and liberty, hierarchy and equality, greed and
          envy, independence and solidarity, capitalism and socialism … there’s
          not even a remote prospect of closure, coherence, or consistency. Every
          attempted definition intensifies fragmentation. Right and Left disagree
          (we all agree), but exactly how they disagree — on that there’s no
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>Peter A. Taylor (May 29, 06:15):</p>
        <p>
          <em>The left-right spectrum, in so far as it is an honest attempt to make
            sense of the world rather than mere propaganda, looks to me like an
            attempt to fit chaos into Procrustes’ bed. … Moldbug loves Carlyle.
            Carlyle admired Cromwell. Moldbug hates Cromwell. Chaos.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Spandrell (May 26, 08:28), twists it back to the Trichotomy:</p>
        <p>
          <em>Both the Western Right and the Chinese Right are a loose combination
            of traditionalists, nationalists and capitalists. Which mostly hate
            each other and never get along when they get any amount of power.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          By this point, however, trichotomous diversity starts to look like a
          mirage of integrity. Right and Left are every difference that has ever
          been conceived, if not yet, then in the near future. If these signs mean
          anything more than <em>the war continues</em>, like the black-and-white
          distinction between chess pieces, no one has yet convincingly shown us
          why.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet perhaps, if Right and Left, apprehended together, mean
          <em>the basic modern antagonism</em>, the conflict itself, as an
          irreducible <em>thing</em>, will prove to be the source of whatever
          sense can be found.
        </p>

          Ideological categorization is the astrology of politics, in the sense
          that it panders to insatiable

          still holds the daily traffic record here, which is probably not
          entirely due to people looking for their political star signs, but
          neither is it mostly for other reasons. New approaches to the Left-Right
          <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/right-and-left/">spectrum</a> — the
          <em>Prime Political Dimension</em> — promise master-keys to the secrets
          of identity-core opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the quite absurdly competitive nature of the terrain, there is
          something truly remarkable about the simplicity and persuasiveness of
          <a href="http://www.anonymousconservative.com/blog/the-theory/rk-selection-theory/">this</a>
          PPD-model, based upon the biological distinction between
          <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/RKSELECT.html">r/K</a> selection
          strategies. The application of this distinction to humans is — I
          confidently assume — radioactively controversial. Its usage as a
          conceptual tool to collapse ideology into an axis of Human Biological
          Diversity is therefore undoubtedly disreputable. (This trigger-warning
          isn’t likely to act as much of a deterrent here.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The ‘Anonymous Conservative’ theory does the most important things
          expected of a PPD-model. In particular, it provides an explanation for
          the polarized clusters of ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ traits, which
          have often proved highly resistant to reflective integration. Why should
          anti-capitalism, pacifism, and sexual laxity belong together? When
          grouped together as expressions of an r-type strategy, this bundle of
          seemingly unconnected ideological predispositions tightens into an
          intuitively coherent whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth special mention is the mapping of ideological difference onto
          environmental conditions. The (‘liberal’) r-type strategy is a response
          top conditions of resource abundance, versus (‘conservative’) K-type
          adaptation to scarcity. When augmented by some modest assumptions about
          the effects of r-type prevalence upon the persistence of Civilization,
          the r/K PPD-model automatically generates a cyclical history of social
          ascent and decline (through a biorealist abundance-decadence mechanism).
          The hope-crushing tragic structure is sure to appeal to reactionary
          sensibilities.

          The <em>Outside in</em> prediction: This is a theory (and

          Political categories — however plausible they look on paper — quickly
          dissolve into senseless noise when applied to modern historical reality,
          unless they foreground <em>populism</em> as the critical discriminating
          factor. Furthermore, <em>populism</em> is for all practical purposes
          already <em>national populism</em>, irrespective of ideological
          commitments to the contrary, since super-national popular constituencies
          exist only in the feverish brains of Utopian intellectuals. The Syriza

          <em>Ushering in the new era, Alexis Tsipras, the prime

            confidence to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. The prime minister
            will go to the president and … the cabinet makeup will be announced by
            the prime minister. The aim for all Greeks is to embark on a new day,
            with full sovereignty.”</em>

          <em>This is our position today with regard to Europe: only a new “heresy”

            democracy, trust in people, egalitarian solidarity.</em>

          incomprehension from the Left (of which we will be seeing a
          great deal): “… Last but not least, while Mr. Kammenos and his
          sovereigntyist right-wing ANEL party [Independent Greeks] are certainly
          a lesser evil compared to formations like To Potami (whose stated goal
          was to force Syriza to stay within the narrow boundaries set by the EU
          and the Memorandums), they are nonetheless an evil. Their participation
          in the government, even with just one minister, would symbolise the end
          of the idea of an ‘anti-austerity government of the Left’. Moreover,
          this is a party of the Right, one that is particularly concerned to
          protect the ‘hard core’ of the state apparatus (it will be important to
          keep a watchful eye over whatever cabinet portfolio it might get). It
          will be no surprise if its first demands are for the ministry of defence
          or public order, though it seems that it will not get them.” (Relevant

          why the new populist upsurge isn’t an intrinsically rightist phenomenon:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>They aren’t necessarily superconservative. They often don’t think in
            ideological terms at all. But they do strongly feel that life in this
            country used to be better for people like them—and they want that
            older country back.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="more-6119"></span><em>You hear from people like them in many other democratic countries
            too. Across Europe, populist parties are delivering a message that
            combines defense of the welfare state with skepticism about
            immigration; that denounces the corruption of parliamentary democracy
            and also the risks of global capitalism. Some of these parties have a
            leftish flavor, like Italy’s Five Star Movement. Some are rooted to
            the right of center, like the U.K. Independence Party. Some descend
            from neofascists, like France’s National Front. Others trace their DNA
            to Communist parties, like Slovakia’s governing Direction–Social
            Democracy.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>These populists seek to defend what the French call “acquired
            rights”—health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older
            people — against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand
            austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge
            accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and
            benefits. In the United States, they lean Republican because they fear
            the Democrats want to take from them and redistribute to Americans who
            are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving—to “spread the
            wealth around,” in candidate Barack Obama’s words to “Joe the Plumber”
            back in 2008. Yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that
            their party does not have their best interests at heart.</em>

          interesting interview with Michael Glennon on “double government”
          concludes with one of the most confused self-abolishing meanderings ever
          to see print:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part
            of the American people. And indifference to the threat that is
            emerging from these concealed institutions. That is where the energy
            for reform has to come from: the American people. Not from government.
            Government is very much the problem here. The people have to take the
            bull by the horns. And that’s a very difficult thing to do, because
            the ignorance is in many ways rational. There is very little profit to
            be had in learning about, and being active about, problems that you
            can’t affect, policies that you can’t change.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The utter nothingness of that paragraph says something important in
          itself. Roughly:
          <em>Sadly, the kind of things that need to happen can’t possibly
            happen</em>, which doesn’t suggest the problem is being taken very seriously.
          <em>All that’s needed is for people to wake up</em> simply doesn’t cut
          it, when — at the very same time — you know beyond all serious question
          that they won’t.

          close to capturing NRx from the other side, mapping out a persuasive
          genealogy (through games theory and public choice analysis). The final
          line of this piece gets closest:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It is the logical endgame of a dark political vision crafted in
            opposition to democratic advances; the realisation of a strange

            the political establishment offers no deliverance.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          … except, they think counter-democratic darkness is already in power, in
          the guise of ‘neoliberalism’, and that the populist political charade,
          with its 40%+ state absorption of economic product, financial central
          planning, and publicly-promoted egalitarian evangelism, is an outcome
          compatible with the triumph of a disillusioned right. It seems an absurd

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Darren Schreiber, a political neuroscientist at the University of
            Exeter in the United Kingdom, first performed brain scans on 82 people
            participating in a risky gambling task, one in which holding out for
            more money increases your possible rewards, but also your possible
            losses. Later, cross-referencing the findings with the participants’
            publicly available political party registration information, Schreiber
            noticed something astonishing: Republicans, when they took the same
            gambling risk, were activating a different part of the brain than
            Democrats.</em>
        </p>
        <em> </em>
        <p>
          <em>Republicans were using the right amygdala, the center of the brain’s
            threat response system. Democrats, in contrast, were using the insula,
            involved in internal monitoring of one’s feelings. Amazingly,
            Schreiber and his colleagues write that this test predicted 82.9
            percent of the study subjects’ political party choices — considerably
            better, they note, than a simple model that predicts your political
            party affiliation based on the affiliation of your parents.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you consider what hereditarian realism makes of “the affiliation of
          your parents” (with its massive confounding effect when brought into
          comparison with neurological characteristics) the level of correlation
          looks even more preposterous.
        </p>
        <p>
          (The
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex">insula</a> sounds
          like an intrinsically leftist neurological structure, I mean — does
          ‘feels monitoring’ really count as doing anything? Radical insulectomy
          in exchange for blockchain credits and Neocameral residency privileges
          has to be worth a test.)

        </a>
        <p>Two revolutions:</p>
        <p>
          (1) Techno-economic self-propelling change obsolesces ever wider swathes
          of humanity on a steepening curve. Capital (i.e. techno-commercial
          synthesis) tendentially autonomizes. For humans, there are ever more
          intriguing opportunities for synergistic attachment, on new terms, but
          the trend is — to put it very mildly — ‘challenging’.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Jacobin political violence, modeled on the French Revolution,
          provides the basis for demands aimed at a redistribution of the
          (capitalist) productive spoils through explicit extortion. All
          socio-political history in the modern epoch falls into compliance with
          this pattern. It coincides quite exactly with ‘democracy’ in its
          modernist usage. Universal Basic Income is its natural <em>telos</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent that there has been an equilibrium between these twin
          processes, it is
          <a href="https://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2016/03/29/the-crisis-of-the-blue-model-2/">coming</a>
          apart. All the pol-economic innovations of recent years, on the Left and
          Right, are indicators of this accelerating disintegration.
        </p>
        <p>So the options are these:</p>
        <p>
          Both (1) and (2) is the <em>Status Quo</em> (delusion).<br />
          Neither (1) or (2) is Reaction (also delusion).<br />
          (1) against (2) is the Neo-Modern Right.<br />
          (2) against (1) is the Neo-Modern Left.
        </p>
        <p>Those are the only slots available.</p>
        <p>Fernandez concludes:</p>
        <p>
          <em>The technological revolution is going to pose increasingly serious
            challenges to nearly every Western social democratic society. People
            are either going to be really angry when they discover there’s no
            patronage or angrier still when they discover they have to provide the
            “basic income” for everybody else. Only one thing is relatively
            certain: the solution to these problems won’t be found in the
            ideologies of the early 20th century.</em>

        </a>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%27s_law">Wagner’s Law</a>
          is a critical concept for political-philosophy. In the words of Adolph
          Wagner (1835–1917, as cited by Wikipedia): “The advent of modern
          industrial society will result in increasing political pressure for
          social progress and increased allowance for social consideration by
          industry.” It thus explains why the right has to be radical, if it isn’t
          to be a sad joke, because snowballing socialism is the ‘natural’ trend.
        </p>
        <p>

          himself
          before it abjectly, and Arnold Kling

          considerably more spine. Also,

          from Scott Sumner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing that falls short of a serious assault upon the real process
          formalized by Wagner’s Law merits the label ‘right-wing’. Conservatism,
          for instance, is merely decelerated leftism. Wilkinson is positively
          enthused by that. The Outer Right is everything that definitely isn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, then, is required to practically defy Wagner’s Law? NRx abstractly
          designates the project. Neocameralism goes into the details.
        </p>
        <p>
          If XS expected the Alt-Right to break from the modern demotic
          meta-regime whose signature is Wagner’s Law, it would celebrate the
          fact. It doesn’t, sadly, expect anything of the kind. That’s why the
          Alt-Right isn’t ‘us’ or even — strictly speaking — a right-wing
          political phenomenon at all.

          of his presidency to date. Since so much was crystallized by it – or
          perhaps <i>brought to a head</i> – it is impossible to begin making
          sense of this event without some preliminary broad-brush outline of its
          context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new dominant ideological polarity, on both sides of the Atlantic,
          exhibits remarkably similar characteristics.  Perhaps most strikingly,
          it displays the culmination of an <i>ideological-class inversion</i>,
          decades in coming, which has aligned the masses – and in particular the
          native working class – with the right, and social elites with the left.
          In consequence, populism has been firmly locked into place as a
          phenomenon of the right. Even those classical liberal stances most
          tightly bound to the advancement of commercial liberty, and thus most
          firmly associated with the conservative right, have not escaped radical
          scrambling, whether through re-assessment, marginalization, or complete
          inversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this new and disconcerting epoch, business interest has ceased to be
          any kind of index for right affiliation, and popular opposition to
          free-trade no longer defines a substantial bloc on the left. If
          anything, the opposite is now true. Those on the left or right
          (including this author) who stubbornly maintain that ideological
          orientation to capitalism is the fundamental determinant of meaningful
          political polarity find themselves cast into a position of unplugged
          anachronism. The stunning magnitude of this transition should not be
          underestimated.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not, of course, a development without alarming precedent. From
          at least one perspective – which is by no means necessarily hysterical –
          the boundary between right-wing populism and fascism can be difficult to
          discern. Insofar as the affective context to Trump’s speech is
          concerned, this is without serious question the most important element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many books could be devoted to the new terms of political controversy,
          and almost certainly will be. Each of the still-unstable new camps is
          highly heterogeneous, and cross-cut with a variety of complex strategic
          interests regarding the way the great rift between them is described, so
          every attempt at articulation will be contested, often fiercely. Yet
          even amid the present shock and confusion, some basic structure is
          discernible. Beside the political opposition between <i>left</i> and
          <i>right</i> – in its present, re-adjusted, sense – it is not hard to
          recognize a corresponding globalist and nationalist emphasis, pitting
          universalists against particularists: defenders of the contemporary
          world’s institutional order against its opponents, or partisans of
          cosmopolitan openness against parochial localists, according to taste.
          Because, concretely, the insurgency marks a crisis of international
          social management, and of confidence in established, credentialized
          elites, to describe it as a struggle between <i>technocrats</i> and
          <i>populists</i> is roughly as neutral as we can get. Such terms are
          employed here as mere labels, rather than as judgments, or explanations.
          No extravagant disparagement is directed at either, relative to the
          other. The constituencies they name have substantial depths, exceeding
          any facile definition. They are obscure social masses in conflict,
          rather than competing ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Trump’s arrival in Warsaw, two pairs of profoundly antagonistic
          political constituencies – one American, the other European – were
          mapped across each other, resonantly. Populist Red America had found its
          local champion in Warsaw, versus that of technocratic Blue America, in
          Berlin. These alignments were not seriously questioned, from any side.
          That the open-door policy of Angela Merkel’s Germany, exemplifying its
          defense of EU institutions and traditional policy stances in general,
          were in fundamental affinity with the ideological intuitions of Blue
          America, were self-evident to all parties. Reciprocally, the
          identification of Trumpian Red America with the Polish stance of EU
          dissidence – on the immigration issue most pointedly – was taken as
          self-evident. Even before the visit, to those paying attention, the
          Polish regime had become an icon of ethno-nationalist popular revolt
          against technocratic transnational government, evangelical secularism,
          and mass migration. Everything clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is difficult to be confident about how much lucid strategy
          under-pinned the event. In all matters Trump, the default assumption
          tends to be <i>not very much</i>. Given Trump’s characteristic bluster,
          and unusual comfort with low demagoguery, such dismissal is to be
          expected. This is not at all to suggest it is acute. If political
          instincts tuned almost to perfection played no part, then divine
          intervention – or some blessing of fortune functionally
          indistinguishable from it – is the next most plausible hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The speech itself was rhetorically pedestrian, and even clumsy. It is
          hard to imagine any single sentence being remembered from it, unless for
          purposes of dry historical illustration. The language was tailored
          entirely to its immediate audience – both local and international –
          rather than to the delectation of future generations. The speech was, in
          this respect among others, a thing of the social media age, tuned to
          instantaneous feedback. It manifestly <i>schmoozed</i>, even by the
          dismal standards of such orations. The rapport it struck with its local
          listeners tipped into collective self-congratulation.
          <i>Wow, we really are great</i> seems to have been the consensus, among
          all directly involved. To those disinclined to identify with the speaker
          and throng in question, this can only have been annoying. Enemy rallies
          generally are, as conservatives learnt during the Obama years. The
          untroubled self-love of one’s foes, exuberantly manifested, is a truly
          horrible thing to see. Naturally enough, Trump has been no more
          distressed by this fact than his predecessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one further, and indispensable contextual element that needs to
          be raised before proceeding to the media reaction – which was, of
          course, the deepest level of <i>the event</i> – and that is the ‘<a
            href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-marx-of-the-anti-semites/">Jew Thing.’</a>
          Everyone knows, at some level, we have to start talking about that, in
          some way, even those who – entirely understandably – <i>really</i> don’t
          want to. Ignoring the topic is a disappearing option, because there’s no
          reason, <i>at all</i>, to think it’s going away. Perhaps it was mere
          coincidence that Trump’s visit took him deep into holocaust territory,
          which, again, nobody really seems to want to mention, even though it was
          an explicit thread within his speech. It was, however, structurally
          essential to everything that followed. Unmistakably, even as it went
          unacknowledged, the Jewish dimension added greatly to the feverish
          intensity of the response.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extreme sensitivity to Jewish socio-political anxieties that has
          prevailed in the postwar West is notably losing its edge, in a way that
          doesn’t seem plausibly reversible. At least in part, this is a
          consequence of the generalization of identity politics, predominantly
          under leftist direction, which has the peculiar cultural effect – in its
          late stages – that special cases are becoming increasingly difficult to
          make. Victimological status bursts its banks, among conditions of
          unbounded, and symmetrical, ethnic paranoia. Lurid grievance anecdotes –
          tailored to every imaginable social niche – are always in abundance, fed
          by Internet supply-lines. Persecution narratives explode from all sides.
          Demands to “check one’s privilege” have proven awkwardly mobile, and
          reversible, as they have been increasingly normalized, even to the point
          – in this particular example – of overt, caustic antisemitism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is nothing less than a crisis of the diasporic Jewish left,
          whose argumentative edge has been blunted by decades of exceptional
          immunity to unflinching criticism. Defensive cultural strategies that
          have, for half a century, been accepted, unquestioned as a special
          ethno-historical privilege have quite suddenly become subjected to
          irreverent public inspection.
          <i>Everyone wants a piece of ethnic survivalism now</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the key to what happened in Warsaw. It is evoked as the subtext
          to Peter Beinart’s
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/trump-speech-poland/532866/">wail</a>
          of distress, when exposed to Trump’s line: “The fundamental question of
          our time is whether the West has the will to survive.” Beinart was quite
          correct in recognizing – horrified – the resonance of this sentence with
          the most extreme elements of the present transition, but that was no
          help to him. He had been ambushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump made his speech explicitly about ethnic survival, disarmingly
          aligned with WWII Jewish victimage, with heroic Polish resistance to
          foreign military occupation, and finally – most provocatively – with the
          contemporary situation of the West. It naturally helped him,
          <i>overwhelmingly</i>, that the Warsaw Uprising was an insurrection
          against actual Nazis. This provided a vaccination against the normal
          workings of Godwin’s Law.
          <i>You know who else wanted ethnic survival? Adolf Hitler!</i> — We have
          reached the core of the event now. There was simply no way this
          response,
          <i>which was the only one that mattered to Trump’s enemies on the
            left</i>, could conceivably be made to operate on this occasion. What was being
          celebrated was the Poles surviving Nazism, then communism, and now –
          infinitely awkwardly – <i>again</i> the Germans, this time cast in the
          role of principal executors for a transnational political order
          promoting mandatory multiculturalism, secular technocracy,  and the
          culture of Western historical self-flagellation. The result, almost
          inevitably, was a rout.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took no great flights of oratorical bedazzlement to triumph on this
          battlefield. The situation did almost everything. Trump’s maddened
          <a
            href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/6/15927590/trump-alt-right-poland-defend-west-civilization-g20">enemies</a>
          blundered into the trap, and were shattered. The left, for whom
          <i>of course the West has no right to survive</i>, found itself
          ideologically isolated to a degree that was unprecedented under the
          present administration. Their tactical allies in the ‘Never-Trump’
          conservative establishment evaporated. Hardened Trump skeptics, such as
          <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/yes-they-really-do-despise-their-civilization/">Rod
            Dreher</a>,

          <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/449313/trump-western-civilization-defense-left-response">Jonah
            Goldberg</a>
          contributed their talents to hunting down the fleeing leftist remnants.
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/trump-warsaw-speech/532917/">David Frum</a>
          only held his ground in opposition by arguing that Trump was personally
          unworthy of his own speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beinart came out of the trauma worst. He will forever be haunted by his
          own definition of the matter at stake, which was immediately judged from
          all sides to be an unforced production of Alt-Right propaganda: “The
          West is a racial and religious term. To be considered Western, a country
          must be largely Christian (preferably Protestant or Catholic) and
          largely white.” Across social media, much nodding ensued, from
          constituencies whose approval he would surely least appreciate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jonah Goldberg refused explicitly to follow what was now so vividly
          exhibited as the road of obligate European ethnomasochism and
          civilizational self-hatred: “What’s ironic is that Peter’s desk-pounding
          outrage about Trump’s talk of the West is oh-so Western. The West’s
          tolerance for anti-Western philosophies is a fairly unique feature of
          the West itself. We love to beat ourselves up.” Defense of the West,
          therefore, is taken up as a cause inclusive even of its critics.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is Rod Dreher, however, who best captures what Trump consolidated in
          Warsaw, perhaps for the first time. He
          <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/trump-west-values/">says</a>, comparing Trump to his
          leftist critics:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            As is often the case with conservatives and Trump, no matter how much
            you may despise him and his pomps and works, in the end, you know that
            he doesn’t hate your beliefs, and that he and his government aren’t
            going to use the power of the State to suppress you as a threat to
            public order and all things good and holy. […] That’s not nothing.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          However much Trump fosters aversion among many conservatives, he also
          provokes events that remind conservatives why they hate liberals (using
          these terms in their degenerate contemporary American sense). Plenty of
          conservatives hate Trump, and will continue to hate him, probably until
          the end of his second term in office, if not longer. But the
          <i>way</i> liberals hate him poses an obvious existential threat to all
          forms of conservative life. As Martin Niemöller never quite said,
          <i>first they came for Trump and it was pretty damn obvious I was next
            in the queue</i>.

        <p>
          The inversion of the meaning of liberalism over the last 150 years has
          to be counted among the world’s most remarkable ideological facts. The
          coinage of the term ‘classical liberalism’ in recent times, as an
          utterly marginalized linguistic act of dissent, attests to the
          comprehensiveness and radicality of the change that has occurred. It has
          surely been essential to the momentum of the historical tide that it has
          usurped the most elementary cultural tools required for its
          articulation. What has taken place cannot even be discussed without
          obscure struggle in a drifting, semiotic fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel B. Klein of the Adam Smith Institute has formulated a lucid
          response to this ideological event, in a
          <a href="http://www.lostlanguage.org/">website</a> entirely devoted to
          the re-ordering of the language of liberalism during the crucial period
          from 1880-1940. Combining ngrams, historical quotations, and reflections
          (from the author), it depicts with unprecedented clarity the process
          through which the Old Liberalism lost its tongue.

          the whole of modern political confusion expose itself in a micro-tremor:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Locke’s commitment both to voluntary religion and voluntary,
            contractual government are mutually reinforcing. Just as people join
            and remain in religious communities by their consent, so they enter
            and sustain political communities. “Men being, as has been said, by
            Nature all free, equal, and independent,” Locke writes in the
            <strong>Second Treatise</strong>, “no one can be put out of this
            estate and subjected to the political power of another without his own
            consent.” If the members of a faith community believe their church is
            failing to uphold its spiritual responsibilities,
            <strong>they have a right to leave</strong> — without fear of
            reprisal. Likewise for a political society: If its members believe the
            political authority is failing to safeguard their natural rights —
            their “lives, liberty, and estates” —
            <strong>it forfeits the right to govern</strong>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>(XS emphasis.)</p>
        <p>
          “Likewise”? Yet one <em>leaves</em> a church, but <em>replaces</em> a
          government. The fall from liberty into democracy takes only a single
          false step. With a little more consistency, the case for Exit-based
          control of government would have been solidly made centuries ago
          (intrinsically secure against all Rousseauistic perversion). Still, it’s
          not too late to do that

          Classical liberals are sitting-out the end of the world. Sitting out,
          mostly, in the way Norma Bates sat out her son’s exploration of
          psychological diversity.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Bates">Norman</a> would
          know why she’s not moving, if he could only remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before even starting, we’re deep into the identity problem, and actually
          several. ‘Liberalism’ is the most profoundly corrupted word in political
          history. Without any exaggeration, rhetorical license, or metaphorical
          latitude, it’s the leathery sliced-off face of something murdered long
          ago which now serves to disguise a foaming chainsaw-wielding maniac
          sharing none of its DNA. That psycho-killer usage needs to be put to
          rest before even getting to Bates. <em>Liberalism</em>, from this point
          forward, means nothing at all like state-happy progressivism. It is
          defined, instead, as the polar opposite of socialism. Its sole
          commanding value is liberty. It is individualist, only ever guardedly
          traditionalist, commercially and industrially oriented, strategically
          neglectful of <em>care</em>, skeptical in respect to all purported
          public agencies, and rigorously economical in respect to every dimension
          of government. It had a truly terrible 20<sup>th</sup> century, and
          right now things aren’t looking any better.
        </p>
        <p>
          At no time in recent history have liberal concerns been less relevant to
          public policy – even as foils, or ‘neoliberal’ bogeymen. It might be
          necessary to return to the 1930s to find a time of comparable eclipse.
          They aren’t being listened to, and they certainly aren’t the
          <em>object</em> of any animated conversations, unless to slip into
          social media banter as the butt of jokes. Their concerns seem eccentric,
          and even identifiably <em>dated</em>, to some point between the end of
          the 1970s and the Baby Bush quagmire. Where the right once nursed a
          secret ambivalence for Pinochet, out of admiration for the Chicago Boys,
          today it’s only interested in the

          It isn’t – mostly – the gender and generational confusion of the Norma /
          Norman sub-personalities that make libertarians so Batesian. It’s the
          third alter, who goes missing in the movie but not in the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(novel)">novel</a>. Norman
          intermittently mistakes himself for <em>Normal</em>. Normal is the one
          who thinks he’s just like everyone else. Liberalism does exactly the
          same thing. It goes mad by thinking of itself as normal, when really
          it’s <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird.aspx">WEIRD</a>.

          Liberal universalism has aged badly in recent years. More specifically,
          it has aged badly in two very different directions. To the left,
          liberalism has been consumed by universalism, becoming a
          liberty-deriding globalist monster, while to the right it has been
          thoroughly demoralized, as recognition has dawned about what its
          universalism actually means. To anyone still trembling to some slight
          residual death-flutter of the liberal impulse, the discussion quickly
          becomes nearly intolerable at this point. Withdrawal,
          psychic-shattering, and other manifestations of traumatized craziness
          ensue.

          Everything that the 2016 US Presidential Election was about is germane.
          Political correctness and the Overton Window in general, race,
          immigration, gender, and social <em>norms</em> in particular, every part
          of it caught upon an aspect of the liberal agony. Donald Trump was, in
          the strict sense – and not just the depraved one – a drastically
          <em>illiberal</em> candidate. In his campaign, public humiliation of
          universalism amounted almost to a platform. American politics had become
          nakedly tribal.

        <p>
          That American dream girl who you were talking to over dinner? The one
          who might have been the future? She bled-out from multiple knife-wounds
          in the shower. <em>You killed her, Norman</em>. Yes, you did. It’s hard
          to believe, obviously, but we’re going to explain how.

          To begin with the most heated dimension of identity politics, liberalism
          has a race problem. Liberals tend to like immigrants a lot, while
          immigrants don’t like liberals very much at all. Some quantitative
          evidence for this is provided by Hal Pashler, in a (2013)
          <a
            href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=76910006711107402900009403100009010100506306103502703609412012310009009109507100607802400602304702004003409907109610709000709900808600805404110412607008112100106703006806203102209700609500209601200102206611208003">paper</a>
          on <em>U.S. Immigrants’ Attitudes Toward Libertarian Values</em>, which
          discovers:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            … a marked pattern of <strong>lower</strong> support for pro-liberty
            views among immigrants as compared to US-born residents. These
            differences were generally statistically significant and sizable, with
            a few scattered exceptions. With increasing proportions of the US
            population being foreign-born, low support for libertarian values by
            foreign-born residents means that the political prospects of
            libertarian values in the US are likely to diminish over time.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          According to a wide range of metrics, foreign-born residents expressed
          significantly lower support for limited government than the native-born
          population. Such effects would almost certainly been strengthened
          further if the latter category had itself been broken-down by ethnicity.
          When Americans were offered a binary choice between smaller or larger
          government, an expansion of government was favored by only 27% of
          Whites, but by 55% of Asians, 64% of Blacks, and 73% of Hispanics. More
          precise ethnic categories only sharpen the pattern. The
          <a href="https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/big-summary-post-on-the-hajnal-line/">Hajnal Line</a>,
          which
          divides Europe’s most committed (north-western) out-breeders
          from their more tribalistic neighbors, summarizes a gradient of
          individualism, among other distinctive liberal traits. Emmanuel Todd’s
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1058107.The_Explanation_of_Ideology">ethnography</a>
          of family types and their associated ideological tendencies binds
          liberalism to the (North-West European) ‘Absolute Nuclear Family.’ 
          Common law traditions are peculiar to Anglo-Saxons. Weber and Sombart
          ethnically identify capitalist dispositions with Protestants and
          (modern) Jews. It begins to seem extremely unlikely that liberals would
          represent a random sample of the world’s peoples.

          John Lott and Lawrence Kenny. It certainly looks that way:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            We find that government continued to grow as female voter turnout
            increased over time. Since suffrage was granted to women in different
            states over a long period of time extending from 1869 to 1920, it is
            unlikely that World War I is the key. These data also allow us to
            address causality questions in unusual ways. The central issue is
            whether giving women the right to vote caused government to grow or
            there was something else that both contributed to women’s getting the
            right to vote and also increased government growth. We find very
            similar effects of women’s suffrage in states that voted for suffrage
            and states that were forced to give women the right to vote, which
            suggests that the second effect is small.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The era of big government and that of female emancipation don’t seem to
          be easily distinguishable. In the incautious
          <a href="https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian">words</a>
          of Peter Thiel:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the
            extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are
            notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of
            “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The hideously compelling but utterly illiberal conclusion seems to be
          that women and non-whites have used their rising political influence to
          massively expand the scope of government. To which a third factor can be
          added, which is marriage. Quite simply, singles are communist maniacs,
          comparatively speaking. In regard to US partisan politics, Steve Sailer
          <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/obama-fringe-vs-romney-core">calls</a>
          it ‘the marriage gap.’ It isn’t small. In the 2012 Presidential
          Election, married <em>women</em> (in general) broke for Romney over
          Obama by 55%, married white women by 63%, and married white men by 67%.
          (Romney’s share among black single women was 2%.)

          As liberal demographic, political, and social policies have been
          entrenched, classical liberals, steering the course of modern social
          evolution from a position modestly to the left of the old monarchical
          and ecclesiastical establishment, eventually became libertarians,
          railing ineffectually against the plunge into socialist tyranny from the
          position of a stranded, alienated, and derided outer right. Throughout
          the whole of this process, liberalism has consisted – almost without
          exception – of white men. These have typically been white men in denial,
          admittedly. Across the entire sweep of world history there has never
          been a population group more neglectful of its own privileges. And thus
          they destroyed themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who has reached the “Oh, my God, the stereotypes!” stage with
          this is onto something. That has been a central part of the learning
          process. All the stereotypes are true (basically). That’s
          <a href="http://spsp.org/blog/stereotype-accuracy-response">science</a>,
          too, if it helps, though it rarely does. Unless inflated, or dogmatized,
          beyond the range of usefulness as broad epistemological heuristics,
          stereotypes have vastly greater reliability than – for instance –
          ideologically-motivated cognitive commitments. What’s more, classical
          liberals used to know that. It’s a Burkean expectation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stereotypes are spontaneous social products, like natural languages,
          common law, and metallic money. To say all this explains why classical
          liberals are conservatives, characterized by a principled acceptance of
          <em>the way things have turned out</em>. What had been, historically, a
          reasonably sanguine view of centralized state government was based on
          how little of it there had ever been. The mere existence of the
          gargantuan social-democratic welfarist state makes such conservative
          liberalism (or liberal conservatism) impossible. Radically frustrated
          revolutionary libertarianism takes its place.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s easy to see what pushes Bates over the edge. He’d thought he was
          <em>Normal</em>, but it turns out he’s a WASP. By a further mad twist,
          he recognizes the one thing WASPs will never do is defend their own
          culture – that’s an essential ethnic tradition. Libertarianism has been
          crazily WASPish that way, when he looks at it, which he can’t for long.
          It’s an intractable paradox that leads through incoherence into
          fragmentation. To have protected his identity would have been something
          only another could have done. Perhaps his mother would look after him?
          But she’s dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The identification of classical liberalism with WASP culture is a strong
          approximation. Few socio-historical correlations are more robust, but
          the coincidence can only be statistical. There are socialist WASPs, and
          classical liberal non-WASPs, although not enough of either to seriously
          disrupt the pattern. When the French, in particular, refer to
          Anglo-Saxons stereotypically, they know what they are talking about, and
          so does anybody else who is paying attention. Hubert Védrine
          <a href="https://www.theglobalist.com/france-and-globalization/">puts</a>
          it best:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [L]et’s admit it: Globalization does not automatically benefit France.
            […] Globalization develops according to principles that correspond
            neither to French tradition nor to French culture. These principles
            include the ultraliberal market economy, mistrust of the state,
            individualism removed from the republican tradition, the inevitable
            reinforcement of the universal and ‘indispensable’ role of the United
            States, common law, the English language, Anglo-Saxon norms, and
            Protestant — more than Catholic — concepts.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It all makes sense from outside, but for WASP culture itself – which is
          to say <em>for liberalism</em> – identity politics is madness. That
          leaves it with nowhere to go. The leather-face schizo-Maoism of the
          contemporary Anglophone left is not any kind of plausible option, but
          neither is anything opening up on the popular right. As the Alt-Right
          consolidates its passionate affair with identity, it sounds ever more
          like Hubert Védrine. Individualism is derided. Its suspicion of
          free-trade owes more to Friedrich List than to the Scottish
          Enlightenment. Its criticism of labor arbitrage is often almost
          indistinguishable from that familiar from socialist traditions, marked
          by the same current of moral outrage at the fact that Capital – despite
          itself being competitively disciplined by footloose consumers – is
          permitted to shop around for its human resources. Wage competition, and
          even price competition more generally, is an increasingly common object
          of attack. At its dynamic, racial edge the Alt-Right promotes solidarity
          among <em>Whites</em>, or <em>Europeans</em>, as if either could ever be
          a WASP thing. <em>Europe</em> is what liberalism has always sought to
          escape. Populism demands grievance politics, which means default
          antipathy to
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/714042.World_on_Fire">market dominant minorities</a>, and thus –
          in
          the Western context – an irrepressible inclination to
          anti-Semitism. None of this describes a place that even maddened
          liberals can go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the word ‘fascism’ has been so ruined by incontinent polemical
          usage, it is difficult to employ without apparent rhetorical over-reach.
          This is unfortunate, because in its cold, technical sense, the word is
          not even merely convenient, but even invaluable. It literally means
          <em>the politics of bundling</em>. <em>Fasces</em> are sticks bound
          together. Liberals are essentially defined by their dissent from that.
          If WASP culture has a core, it is loose association. There’s no real
          possibility of simply sticking it back together. Pirates and cowboys
          don’t do national solidarity. That would be a different culture
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Bates, he knows his mother is dead by now, and even that he
          killed her – <em>kills anyone like her</em>. Bad thoughts flood in. It’s
          difficult to move on, but at least he has confidence in his own
          inviolable non-aggression principle. There’s no way it could have been
          as they say, because he wouldn’t hurt anyone. Not even a fly.

          </a>
          <p>
            To be a reactionary, minimally speaking, requires no more than a
            recognition that things are going to hell. As the source of decay is
            traced ever further back, and attributed to ever more deeply-rooted –
            and securely mainstream — sociopolitical assumptions, the reactionary
            attitude becomes increasingly extreme. If innovative elements are
            introduced into either the diagnosis or the proposed remedy, a
            neo-reactionary mentality is born.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the United States, along with the world that it has built, careers
            into calamity, neo-reactionary extremism is embarrassingly close to
            becoming a vogue. If evidence is needed, consider the Vacate Movement, a
            rapidly growing dissident faction within the 0.0000001%. This is a
            development that would have been scarcely imaginable, were it not for
            the painstakingly crafted, yet rhetorically effervescent provocations of
            Mencius Moldbug.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Moldbug, immoderate neo-reaction has learnt many essential and
            startling facts about the genealogy and tendency of history’s central
            affliction, newly baptized <em>the Cathedral</em>. It has been liberated
            from the mesmerism of ‘democratic universalism’ – or evangelical
            ultra-puritanism – and trained back towards honest (and thus forbidden)
            books. It has re-learnt class analysis, of unprecedented explanatory
            power. Much else could have been added, before arriving at our
            destination: the schematic outline for a ‘neocameral’ alternative to the
            manifestly perishing global political order. (On a trivial etiquette
            matter: Moldbug politely asks to be addressed as ‘Mencius’ — comparable
            requests by Plato Jiggabug and Siddhartha Moldbucket have been evaded
            too.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Moldbug scrupulously distances his proposals from any hint of
            revolutionary agitation, or even the mildest varieties of civil
            disobedience. Neocameralism is not designed to antagonize, but rather to
            <em>restore order</em> to social bodies that have squandered it, by
            drafting a framework compatible with the long-lost art of effective
            government. (‘Long-lost’, that is, to the West – the Singapore example,
            among those of other city states and special economic zones, is never
            far removed.) Neocameralism would not overthrow anything, but rather
            arise amongst ruins. It is a solution awaiting the terminal
            configuration of a problem.
          </p>
          <p>The neocameral program proceeds roughly as follows:</p>
          <p>Phase-1: Constructively disciplined lamentation</p>
          <p>Phase-2: Civilization collapses</p>
          <p>
            Phase-3: Re-boot to a modernized form of absolute monarchy, in which
            citizens are comprehensively stripped of all historically-accumulated
            political rights
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its obvious attractions to partisans of liberty, this program is
            not without its dubious features, a few of which can be touched upon
            here whilst rehearsing the Moldbug case for Neocameral government in
            slightly greater detail. Stated succinctly and preliminarily, our
            reservations drift into focus when that guy on a white horse appears.
            Where exactly does he come from?
          </p>
          <p>
            To answer ‘Carlyle’ would be easy, and not exactly inaccurate, but it
            would also miss the structural coherence of the issue. Moldbug refuses
            to call his neocameral dictator a ‘national CEO’ (which he is),
            preferring to describe him as a ‘monarch’ (which – as a non-dynastic
            executive appointee — he isn’t), for reasons both stylistic and
            substantial. Stylistically, royalism is a provocation, and a
            dramatization of reactionary allegiance. Substantially, it foregrounds
            the question of <em>sovereignty</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moldbug’s political philosophy is founded upon a revision to the
            conception of property, sufficient to support the assertion that
            <em>sovereign power is properly understood as the owner of a country</em>. It is only at this level of
            political
            organization that real property
            rights – i.e. <em>protections</em> – are sustained.

            The sovereign power (sovereign corporation, or ‘sovcorp’), alone, is
            able to ensure its own property rights. Its might and rights are
            absolutely identical, and from this primary identity subordinate rights
            (to ‘secondary property’) cascade down through the social hierarchy.
            Neocameralism is nothing but the systematic, institutional recognition
            of this reality. (Whether it is, in fact, a ‘reality’ is a question we
            shall soon proceed to.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps surprisingly, Moldbug’s conclusions can be presented in terms
            that recovering libertarians have found appealing:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Neocameralism is the idea that a sovereign state or primary
                corporation is not organizationally distinct from a secondary or
                private corporation. Thus we can achieve good management, and thus
                libertarian government, by converting sovcorps to the same
                management design that works well in today’s private sector – the
                joint-stock corporation.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>One way to approach neocameralism is to see it as a refinement of
                royalism, an ancient system in which the sovcorp is a sort of family
                business. Under neocameralism, the biological quirks of royalism are
                eliminated and the State “goes public,” hiring the best executives
                regardless of their bloodline or even nationality.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Or you can just see neocameralism as part of the usual capitalist
                pattern in which services are optimized by aligning the interests of
                the service provider and the service consumer. If this works for
                groceries, why shouldn’t it work for government? I have a hard time
                in accepting the possibility that democratic constitutionalism would
                generate either lower prices or better produce at Safeway …</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In order to take a step back from this vision, towards its foundations,
            it is useful to scrutinize its building blocks. When Moldbug defines
            property as “any stable structure of monopoly control” what is really
            meant by ‘control’? It might seem simple enough. To control something is
            to use, or make use of it — to put it to work, such that a desired
            outcome is in fact achieved. ‘Property’ would be glossed as
            <em>exclusive right of use</em>, or instrumental utilization, conceived
            with sufficient breadth to encompass consumption, and perhaps (we will
            come to this), donation or exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Complications quickly arise. ‘Control’ in this case would involve
            technical competence, or the ability to make something work. If control
            requires that one can <em>use something effectively</em>, then it
            demands compliance with natural fact (through techno-scientific
            understanding and practical skills). Even consumption is a type of use.
            Is this historical variable – vastly distant from intuitive notions of
            sovereignty – actually suited to a <em>definition</em> of property?
          </p>
          <p>
            It might be realistic to conceive property through control, and control
            through technical competence, but it would be hard to defend as an
            advance in formalism. Since this problem thoroughly infuses the topic of
            ‘might’, or operational sovereignty, it is also difficult to isolate, or
            parenthesize. Moldbug’s frequent, enthusiastic digressions into the
            practicalities of crypto-locked military apparatuses attest strongly to
            this. The impression begins to emerge that the very possibility of
            sovereign property is bound to an irreducibly fuzzy, historically
            dynamic, and empirically intricate investigation into the
            micro-mechanics of power, dissolving into an acid fog of Clauswitzean
            ‘friction’ (or ineliminable unpredictability).
          </p>
          <p>
            More promising, by far – for the purposes of tractable argument — is a
            strictly formal or contractual usage of ‘control’ to designate the
            exclusive right to <em>free disposal</em> or
            <em>commercial alienation</em>. Defined this way, ownership is a legal
            category, co-original with the idea of contract, referring to those
            things which one has the right to trade (based on natural law). Property
            is essentially marketable. It cannot exist unless it can be alienated
            through negotiation. A prince who cannot trade away his territory does
            not ‘own’ it in any sense that matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moldbug <em>seems</em> to acknowledge this, in at least three ways.
            Firstly, his formalization of sovereign power, through conversion into
            sovereign stock, commercializes it. Within the neocameral regime, power
            takes the form of revenue-yielding property, available for
            <em>free disposal</em> by those who wield it. That is the sole basis for
            the corporate analogy. If sovereign stock were not freely disposable,
            its ‘owners’ would be mere stewards, subject to obligations,
            non-alienable political responsibilities, or administrative duties that
            demonstrate with absolute clarity the subordination to a higher
            sovereignty. (That is, broadly speaking, the current situation, and
            inoffensively conventional political theory.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, the neocameral state exists within a
            <em><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1.html"
                target="_blank">patchwork</a></em>, or system of interactions, through which they compete for
            population,
            and in which peaceful (or commercial) redistributions — including
            takeovers and break-ups — are facilitated. Unless sovereign stock can be
            traded within the patchwork, it is not <em>property</em> at all. This in
            turn indicates that ‘internal’ positive legislation, as dictated by the
            domestic ‘sovereign’, is embedded within a far more expansive normative
            system, and the definition of ‘property’ cannot be exhausted by its
            <em>local determination</em> within the neocameral micro-polis. As
            Moldbug repeatedly notes, an introverted despotism that violated broader
            patchwork norms – such as those governing free exit — could be reliably
            expected to suffer a collapse of sovereign stock value (which implies
            that the substance of sovereign stock is systemically, rather than
            locally, determined). If the entire neocameral state is
            <em>disciplined</em> through the patchwork, how real can its local
            sovereignty be? This systemic disciplining or subversion of local
            sovereignty, it should be noted, is the sole attraction of the
            neocameral schema to
            <a href="http://www.distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/12/18/rampant-moldbuggery"
              target="_blank">supporters</a>
            of dynamic geography (who want nothing more than for the national
            government to become the patchwork system’s bitch).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly (and relatedly), neocameralism is floated as a model for
            experimental government, driven cybernetically towards effectiveness by
            the same types of feedback mechanisms that control ‘secondary’
            corporations. In particular, population traffic between neocameral
            states is conceived as a fundamental regulator, continuously measuring
            the functionality of government, and correcting it in the direction of
            attractiveness. The incentive structure of the neocameral regime – and
            thus its claim to practical rationality — rests entirely upon this. Once
            again, however, it is evidently the radical limitation of local
            sovereignty, rather than its unconstrained expression, which promises to
            make such governments work. Free exit – to take the single most
            important instance — is a rule imposed at a higher level than the
            national sovereign, operating as a natural law of the entire patchwork.
            Without free exit, a neocameral state is no more than a parochial
            despotism. The absolute sovereign of the state <em>must choose</em> to
            comply with a rule he did not legislate … something is coming unstuck
            here (it’s time to send that white horse to the biodiesel tanks).
          </p>
          <p>
            Neocameralism necessarily commercializes sovereignty, and in doing so it
            accommodates power to natural law. Sovereign stock (‘primary property’)
            and ‘secondary property’ become commercially inter-changeable,
            dissolving the original distinction, whilst local sovereignty is
            rendered compliant with the wider commercial order, and thus becomes a
            form of constrained ‘secondary sovereignty’ relative to the primary or
            absolute sovereignty of the system itself. Final authority bleeds out
            into the catallactic ensemble, the <em>agora</em>, or
            <em>commercium</em>, where <em>what can really happen</em> is decided by
            natural law. It is this to which sovereign stockholders,
            <em>if they are to be effective</em>, and to prosper, must defer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fundamental point, and the reason why the pretender on the white
            horse is so misleading, is that sovereignty cannot, in principle, inhere
            in a particular social agent – whether individual, or group. This is
            best demonstrated in reference to the concept of natural law (which
            James Donald
            <a href="http://jim.com/rights.html" target="_blank">outlines</a> with
            unsurpassed brilliance). When properly understood, or articulated,
            natural law <em>cannot possibly be violated</em>. Putting your hand into
            a fire, and being burnt, does not defy the natural law that temperatures
            beyond a certain range cause tissue damage and pain. Similarly,
            suppressing private property, and producing economic cataclysm, does not
            defy the natural law that human economic behavior is sensitive to
            incentives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Positive law, as created by legislators, takes the form: do (or don’t
            do) this. Violations will be punished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Natural law, as discovered by any rational being, takes the form:
            <em>do what thou wilt and accept the consequences</em>. Rewards and
            punishments are intrinsic to it. It cannot be defied, but only
            misunderstood. It is therefore absolutely sovereign (<em>Deus sive Natura</em>). Like any other being,
            governments, however powerful, can only comply
            with it, either through intelligent adaptation and flourishing, or
            through ignorance, incompetence, degeneration, and death. To
            God-or-Nature it matters not at all. Natural law is indistinguishable
            from the true sovereign power which really decides what can work, and
            what doesn’t, which can then – ‘secondarily’ — be learnt by rational
            beings, or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moldbug knows this – really. He demonstrates it – to take just one
            highly informative example — through his insistence that a neocameral
            state would tend to tax at the Laffer optimum. That is to say, such a
            state would prove its effectiveness by maximizing the return on
            sovereign property <em>in compliance with reality</em>. It does not
            legislate the Laffer curve, or choose for it to exist, but instead
            recognizes that it has been discovered, and with it an aspect of natural
            law. Anything less, or other, would be inconsistent with its legitimacy
            as a competent protector of property. To survive, prosper, and even
            pretend to sovereignty, it can do nothing else. Its power is delegated
            by <em>commercium</em>.
          </p>

            It is surely no coincidence that Cnut the Great has been described by

            his story:

              <em>His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of
                England and Denmark together. Cnut held this power-base together by
                uniting Danes and Englishmen under cultural bonds of wealth and
                custom, rather than sheer brutality.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Most importantly:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Henry of Huntingdon, the 12th-century chronicler, tells how Cnut
                set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the tide to halt and
                not wet his feet and robes. Yet “continuing to rise as usual [the
                tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal
                person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: ‘Let all men know how
                empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy
                of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal

            <em>The transcendental self is not the empirical person, Kant argues,
              though confusion of the two is a reliable anthropological fact. …

              Monarchical theater is (exactly) a naive image of ‘the sovereign’. …
              Moldbug is clear that the ‘monarch’ (state CEO) is an agent of
              sovereignty, and not the sovereign ‘himself’. … The LARPing loved by
              romantic reaction, and derided by the Left, dwells entirely within
              this rigorously identifiable philosophical error. … Sovereignty is no
              less a profound philosophical enigma than the transcendental self, the
              prompt for an exploration of vast difficulty. … “We know what a

            Something of greater articulacy is clearly called for, but the kernel
            would be unchanged. ‘Sovereignty’ is the translation of the
            transcendental into the realm of political philosophy. This is why, even
            for atheists, the Idea of Divine Right sovereign legitimacy is a
            superior point of departure than mere charismatic leadership.

              hierarchy … we will have more fluidity, more equality and therefore
              more anarchy to look forward to. This is profoundly disturbing,
              because civilization abjures anarchy. … without order — without
              hierarchy — there is nothing.</em>

            Perhaps, in the field of international relations, Kaplan is
            <em>more</em> Moldbug than Moldbug, presenting an uncompromisingly
            hardline reactionary model of world order, completely undisturbed by
            domestic considerations or even the slightest hint of libertarian
            descent. If <em>sovereignty is conserved</em> globally, as well as
            nationally, a worldwide Patchwork order looks as improbable as a stable
            constitutional republic, and exit options evaporate. Scale-free
            Moldbuggian analysis could prove more than a little blood-chilling.

            <em>Suppose there is no anarchy between sovereigns. This means there is a

            The interlocking achievements of Kurt Gödel, which revolutionized the
            rigorous understanding of logic, arithmetic, and time, are not of a
            nature that wins ready popular acclamation. There is nevertheless a
            broadly factual story about him that has attained some notable level of
            popularity, and it is one that connects suggestively with the core
            concerns of his work. At the website of the Institute for Advanced Study
            (where Gödel was based from 1940 until his death in 1978), Oskar
            Morgenstern’s recollection of the episode in question
            <a href="http://www.ias.edu/people/godel/institute" target="_blank">is recorded</a>:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>[Gödel] rather excitedly told me that in looking at the
                Constitution, to his distress, he had found some inner
                contradictions and that he could show how in a perfectly legal
                manner it would be possible for somebody to become a dictator and
                set up a Fascist regime never intended by those who drew up the
                Constitution. I told him that it was most unlikely that such events
                would ever occur, even assuming that he was right, which of course I
                doubted.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>But he was persistent and so we had many talks about this
                particular point. I tried to persuade him that he should avoid
                bringing up such matters at the examination before the court in
                Trenton, and I also told Einstein about it: he was horrified that
                such an idea had occurred to Gödel, and he also told him he should
                not worry about these things nor discuss that matter.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Many months went by and finally the date for the examination in
                Trenton came. On that particular day, I picked up Gödel in my car.
                He sat in the back and then we went to pick up Einstein at his house
                on Mercer Street, and from there we drove to Trenton. While we were
                driving, Einstein turned around a little and said, “Now Gödel, are
                you really well prepared for this examination?” Of course, this
                remark upset Gödel tremendously, which was exactly what Einstein
                intended and he was greatly amused when he saw the worry on Gödel’s
                face.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>When we came to Trenton, we were ushered into a big room, and while
                normally the witnesses are questioned separately from the candidate,
                because of Einstein’s appearance, an exception was made and all
                three of us were invited to sit down together, Gödel, in the center.
                The examiner first asked Einstein and then me whether we thought
                Gödel would make a good citizen. We assured him that this would
                certainly be the case, that he was a distinguished man, etc.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>And then he turned to Gödel and said, Now, Mr. Gödel, where do you
                come from?</em>
            </p>
            <p><em>Gödel: </em>Where I come from? Austria<em>.</em></p>
            <p>
              <em>The examiner: </em>What kind of government did you have in
              Austria<em>?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Gödel: </em>It was a republic, but the constitution was such that
              it finally was changed into a dictatorship<em>.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The examiner: </em>Oh! This is very bad. This could not happen in
              this country.
            </p>
            <p><em>Gödel: </em>Oh, yes, I can prove it<em>.</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            To the great advantage of intelligence on earth, Gödel did not in the
            end disqualify himself from residence in the USA through this
            disastrously over-accurate understanding of its constitution. Evidently,
            despite everything that had happened by 1947, detailed attachment to the
            constitution had not yet become a thought-crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, emphatic attachment to the US Constitution is restricted to the
            decent i.e.
            <a href="http://www.teaparty.org/" target="_blank">lunatic fringe</a> of
            the Outer Party, and even
            <a href="http://www.constitutionparty.com/" target="_blank">crankier</a>
            outliers.
            <a href="http://www.agorism.info/" target="_blank">Hardcore libertarians</a>
            tend to dismiss it as a distraction, if not a malign incarnation of
            statist degeneracy (when compared to the less Leviathan-compatible
            Articles of Confederation). Reactionary realists of the Moldbug school
            (in all their vast multitudes) are at least as dismissive, seeing it as
            little more than a fetish object and evasion of the timeless practical
            question:
            <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F" target="_blank">Quis custodiet
                ipsos
                custodes</a></em>? If constitutions are realistically indefensible, both in principle
            and as a matter of brutally demonstrated historical fact, what
            significance could they have to any cold-eyed analysis of power?
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the overwhelmingly bulk of present USG activity is transparently
            unconstitutional, the skeptical case largely makes itself. Presidents
            mobilize congressional support to appoint Supreme Court justices whose
            principal qualification for office is willingness to conspire in the
            subversion of the constitution, to the deafening applause of a
            pork-ravening electorate and their intermediary lobbies. How could that
            plausibly be resisted? Perhaps that was Gödel’s point.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, no one really knows what Gödel’s point was.
            <a href="http://jeffreykegler.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Kegler</a>, who has examined the topic
            carefully, leaves it open. “Apparently,
            the ‘inconsistency’ noted by Gödel is simply that the Constitution
            provides for its own amendment,”
            <a href="http://blog.plover.com/law/Godel-dictatorship-2.html" target="_blank">suggests</a>
            a “gravely disappointed” Mark Dominus, who “had been hoping for
            something brilliant and subtle that only Gödel would have noticed.”
            Dominus draws this tentative conclusion from Peter Suber’s
            <em>Paradox of Self-Amendment</em>, where it is
            <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec16.htm#B" target="_blank">stated</a>
            more boldly:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Kurt Gödel the Austrian logician understood that an omnipotent AC
                contained the risk of tyranny. Gödel studied the U.S. constitution
                in preparation for his oral citizenship examination in 1948. He
                noticed that the AC had procedural limitations but no substantive
                limitations; hence it could be used to overturn the democratic
                institutions described in the rest of the constitution.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Suber adds: “A desire to limit the amending power, or to make it more
            difficult — not the same thing — shows a distrust for democracy or a
            denial that in general the people deserve what they get.” (We’ll get
            back to that later.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This is conceptually persuasive, because it harmonizes Gödel’s
            constitutional concerns with his central intellectual pre-occupation:
            the emergence of inconsistencies within self-referential formal systems.
            The Amending Clause (Article V, section 1) is the occasion for the
            constitution to talk about itself, and thus to encounter problems
            rigorously comparable to those familiar from Gödel’s incompleteness
            theorems in mathematical logic. Despite the neatness of this ‘solution’,
            however, there is no solid evidence to support it. Furthermore,
            self-referential structures can be identified at numerous other points.
            For instance, is not the authority of the Supreme Court respecting
            constitutional interpretation a similar point of reflexivity, with
            unlimited potential for circularity and paradox? This insight,
            highly-regarded among the neo-reactionaries, recognizes that the
            constitution allows – in principle – for a sufficiently corrupted
            Supreme Court to ‘interpret’ its way to absolute power (in conformity
            with a constitution that has sublimed into pure ‘life’). Insofar as a
            constitution allows for its own processing, it must – ultimately — allow
            anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moldbug asks us to accelerate through this formal tangle, cutting the
            Gordian knot. “Sovereignty is conserved,” he
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html" target="_blank">repeats</a>,
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2012_11_01_archive.html"
              target="_blank">insistently</a>,
            so
            the occasions when power undertakes to bind itself are essentially
            risible. <em>Of course</em> the final custodian of the constitution is a
            constitutionally unrestrained dictator. That’s simple
            <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2012/11/adore-river-of-meat.html"
              target="_blank">Schmittian
              sanity</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all due contempt for <em>argumentum ad hominem</em>, it can
            probably still be agreed that Gödel was not a fool, so that his excited
            identification of a <em>localized flaw</em> in the US Constitution
            merits consideration as just that (rather than an excuse to bin the
            entire problematic). The formal resonances between his topically
            disparate arguments provide a further incentive to slow down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether in number theory, or space-time cosmology, Gödel’s method was to
            advance the formalization of the system under consideration and then
            test it to destruction upon the ‘strange loops’ it generated (paradoxes
            of self-reference and time-travel). In each case, the system was shown
            to permit cases that it could not consistently absorb, opening it to an
            interminable process of revision, or technical improvement. It thus
            defined
            <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html" target="_blank">dynamic intelligence</a>, or the
            logic
            of evolutionary imperfection, with an adequacy that was
            both sufficient and necessarily inconclusive. What it did not do was
            trash the very possibility of arithmetic, mathematical logic, or cosmic
            history — except insofar as these were falsely identified with idols of
            finality or closure.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the slender evidence available, Gödel’s ‘reading’ of the US
            Constitution was strictly analogous. Far from excusing the abandonment
            of constitutionalism, it identified constitutional design as the only
            intellectually serious response to the problem of politics (i.e.
            untrammeled power). It is a subtle logical necessity that constitutions,
            like any formal systems of comparable complexity, cannot be perfected or
            consistently completed. In other words, as Benjamin Franklyn fully
            recognized, any republic is precarious. Nothing
            <em>necessarily</em> follows from this, but a number of things might.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most abruptly, one might contemplate the sickly child with sadness,
            before abandoning it on the hillside for the wolves. Almost every
            interesting voice on the right seems to be heading this way.
            Constitutions are a grim joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, constitutionalism could be elevated to a new level of
            cultural dignity, in keeping with its status as the sole model of
            republican government, or truly logical politics. This would require,
            first of all, that the necessity for constitutional modification was
            recognized only when such modification
            <em>made the constitution stronger</em>, in purely formal, or systemic
            terms. In the US case, the first indication of such an approach would be
            an amendment of Article Five itself, in order to specify that
            constitutional amendments are tolerated only when they satisfy criteria
            of formal improvement, legitimated in exact, mathematical terms, in
            accordance with standards of proof no different than those applicable to
            absolutely uncontroversial arguments (theorems). Constitutional design
            would be subsumed within applied mathematics as a subsection of
            nonlinear control theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under these (unlikely) circumstances, the purpose of the constitution is
            to sustain itself, and thus the Republic. As a mathematical object, the
            constitution is maximally simple, consistent, necessarily incomplete,
            and interpretable as a model of natural law. Political authority is
            allocated solely to <em>serve the constitution</em>. There are no
            authorities which are not overseen, within nonlinear structures.
            Constitutional language is formally constructed to eliminate all
            ambiguity and to be processed algorithmically. Democratic elements,
            along with official discretion, and legal judgment, is incorporated
            reluctantly, minimized in principle, and gradually eliminated through
            incremental formal improvement. Argument defers to mathematical
            expertise. Politics is a disease that the constitution is designed to
            cure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Extreme skepticism is to be anticipated not only from the Moldbuggian
            royalists, but from all of those educated by Public Choice theory to
            analyze ‘<a href="http://www.montana.edu/econ/hfretwell/332/buchananpublicchoice.pdf"
              target="_blank">politics
              without romance</a>’. How could <em>defending the constitution</em> become an absolute,
            categorical or unconditional imperative, when the only feasible
            defenders are <em>people</em>, guided by multiple incentives, few of
            which align neatly with objective constitutional order? Yet, how is this
            different from the question of mathematical or natural scientific
            progress? Are not mathematicians equally people, with appetites, egos,
            sex-driven status motivations, and deeply defective capabilities for
            realistic introspection? How does maths advance? (No one can seriously
            deny that it does.) The answer surely lies in its autonomous or
            impersonal criteria of excellence, combined with pluralistic
            institutions that facilitate Darwinian convergence. The Gödelian
            equivalence between mathematical logic and constitutional government
            indicates that such principles and mechanisms are absent from the public
            domain only due to defective (democratic-bureaucratic) design.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to <em>deep realism</em>, and to guns, is there any reason
            to think the military is resistant by nature to constitutional
            subordination? Between the sublime office of Commander in Chief, and the
            mere man, is it not obvious that authority should tend to gravitate to
            the former? It might be argued that civilization is nothing else, that
            is to say: the tendency of <em>personal authority</em> to decline
            towards zero. Ape-men will reject this of course. It’s what they do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between democracy, monarchy, anarchy, or republican government, the
            arguments will not end soon. They are truly ancient, and illustrated in
            the Odyssey, by the strategy of binding oneself against the call of the
            Sirens. Can Odysseus bind himself? Only republicans defend the attempt,
            as Gödel did. All of the others let the Sirens win. Perhaps they will.

            How can reactionaries criticize free republics for falling apart?
            Everything reactionaries have ever respected fell apart.

            <h4 class="post-title">The Odysseus Problem</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Moldbug’s insistence that ‘Sovereignty is conserved’ surely counts as
            one of the most significant assertions in the history of political
            thought. It is arguably the fundamental axiom of his ‘system’, and its
            implications are almost inestimably profound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sovereignty is conserved</em> says that anything that appears to
            <em>bind</em> sovereignty <em>is itself</em> in reality true
            sovereignty, binding something else, and something less. It is therefore
            a negative answer to the
            <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it/">Odysseus Problem</a>:
            <em>Can Sovereignty bind
              itself</em>? If Moldbug’s assertion is
            accepted, constitutional government is impossible, except as a futile
            aspiration, a ‘noble lie’, or a cynical joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to Moldbug’s powerful arguments, we know from the work of
            Kurt Gödel that the Odysseus Problem is at least partially insoluble,
            since it is logically impossible for there to be a
            <em>perfect knot</em>. However well constructed a constitution might be,
            it cannot, in principle, seal itself reliably against the possibility of
            a surreptitious undoing. In a sufficiently complex (self-referential)
            constitutional order, there will always be permissible procedures whose
            consequences have not been completely anticipated, and whose consistency
            with the continuation of the system cannot be ensured in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet it would be obviously misleading to assume that such concerns were
            not already active during the formulation of the American Constitution.
            It is precisely because some quite lucid comprehension of the Odysseus
            Problem was at work, that the founders envisaged the grounding principle
            of republican constitutionalism as a division of powers, whereby the
            component units of a disintegrated sovereignty
            <em>bound each other</em>. The animating system of incentives was not to
            rest upon a naive expectation of altruism or voluntary restraint, but
            upon a systematically integrated <em>network of suspicion</em>, formally
            installing the anti-monarchical impulse as an enduring, distributed
            function. If the republic was to work, it would be because the
            <em>fear of  power</em> in other hands permanently over-rode the
            <em>greed for power</em> in one’s own.
          </p>
          <p>
            The American Constitution was, of course, destroyed, in successive
            waves. After Lincoln, and FDR, only a pitiful and derided shell remains.
            USG has unified itself, and the principle of sovereign power has been
            thoroughly re-legitimated in the court of popular opinion. Democracy
            rose as the republic fell, exposing yet again the essential political
            bond of the tyrant with the mob, Leviathan with the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does this ruin refute the constitutional conjecture? Is there really
            nothing further to be said in defense of imperfect (but perhaps
            improvable) knots? This one came horribly undone. Might there be other,
            better ones? <em>Outside in</em> remains obstinately interested in the
            problem …
          </p>

            ADDED: Many relevant speculations and insights are to be found in
            <a href="http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/024257.html">this</a>
            article on the practicalities of secession (especially section XI J,
            XII, XIII, and XIV). “Since it is important that the AFR [or proposed
            American Federal Republic] function as a constitutional republic, one of
            the first things it should do is to hold a constitutional convention. We
            anticipate that the resulting document will be similar to the present
            American constitution, but not identical.” It includes some (very
            modest) recommendations to curtail democracy.

            Moldbug’s ‘Royalism’ (or Carlylean reaction) rests upon the proposition
            that the Misesian catallactic order is, like Newtonian mechanics, true
            only as a special case within a more general system of principles.

              step – without skipping steps. In a state of war, advance toward
              peace; in a state of insecurity, advance toward security; in a state
              of security, advance toward law; in a state of law, advance toward
              freedom.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Alexander Hamilton (Federalist #8) pursues a closely related argument,
            in reverse:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national
              conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way
              to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident
              to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of
              continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to
              resort for their repose and security to institutions which have a
              tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe,
              they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This pyramidal schema is ‘neat’, but by no means unproblematic. Like any
            hierarchical structure operating within a complex, reflexive field, it
            invites strange loops which scramble its apparently coherent order. Even
            accepting, as realism dictates, that war exists at the most basic level
            of social possibility, so that military survival grounds all  ‘higher’
            elaborations, can we be entirely confident that catallactic forces are
            neatly confined to the realm of pacific and sophisticated civilian
            intercourse? Does not
            <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/">this</a> mode of analysis
            lead to exactly the opposite conclusion? Self-organizing networks are
            <em>tough</em>, and perhaps supremely tough.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is nothing obvious or uncontroversial about the model of the
            market order as a fragile flower, blossoming late, and precariously,
            within a hot-house constructed upon very different principles. The
            <em>pact</em> is already catallactic, and who is to say — at least,
            without a prolonged fight — that it is subordinate, in principle, to a
            more primordial assertion of order. Subordination is complex, and
            conflicted, and although the Pyramid certainly has a case, the trial of
            reality is not easily predictable. An ultimate (or basic)
            <em>fanged freedom</em> is eminently thinkable.  (Isn’t that what the
            Second Amendment argument is about?)

            Even prior to the twitterization catastrophe, and the terminal
            disintegration of thought into nano-particles, symphonic orchestration
            wasn’t obviously emerging as an <em>Outside in</em> core competence. One
            unfortunate consequence of this deficiency is that highly persuasive
            blogging ideas get endlessly can-kicked, unless they can be easily
            pulverized.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Blogging ideas” doesn’t mean anything grandiose (those type of thoughts
            splinter anything in their path, and bust in), but rather highly
            medium-adapted discussion packages, which present things in a way that
            racks up hits. The relevant example right now is — or rather ‘was to be’
            —
            <strong><em>The X Fundamental Disputes of Neoreaction</em></strong> (‘X’
            being an as-yet undetermined number — optimally of surreptitious
            qabbalistic significance). That puppy would have been clocking up views

            The principal provocations for this spasm of impatience are two posts on
            the topic of monarchism,
            <a href="http://anomalyuk.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/kingdom-2037-discussion.html">at</a>
            <em>Anomaly UK</em>,
            <a href="http://www.moreright.net/ten-objections-to-traditionalism-and-monarchism-with-answers/">and</a>
            <em>More Right</em>. The Great AUK post is structured as a science
            fiction scenario, modeling a future monarchist regime, whilst Michael
            Anissimov’s MR defense of “traditionalism and monarchism” is organized
            dialectically. Both serve to consolidate an affinity between neoreaction
            and monarchist  ideals that was already solidly established by Moldbug’s
            Jacobitism. It would not be unreasonable to propose that this affinity
            is strong enough to approach an identity (which is quite possibly what
            both of these writers do envisage). So the time to frame the monarchist
            case within a question, as a Fundamental Dispute of Neoreaction, is now.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1376"></span>Perhaps the first thing to note is that,
            even though <em>Outside in</em> adopts the anti-monarchist position in
            this dispute, it finds the <em>Anomaly UK</em> description of a future
            Britain remarkably attractive, and — without any hesitation — a vast
            improvement upon the present dismal state of that country’s political
            arrangements. In addition, there is not a single objection to the
            monarchist idea, among the ten listed by Anissimov, that we find even
            slightly persuasive. If these were the reasons to refuse monarchy
            government, any suggestion of republican sentiment would strike us as an
            obnoxious perversion. Our dissatisfaction with the monarchist solution
            has other grounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary concern is abstractly constitutional, which is to say, it
            arises from considerations of political engineering. For our purposes
            here, the concept of ‘constitutional government’ can be quite exactly
            specified, to refer to a blueprint for the mechanism of power that
            achieves <em>cybernetic closure</em>. An adequate constitution designs a
            fragmentation of authority, such that each element is no less controlled
            than controlling, with the result that sovereignty <em>emerges</em> from
            a distributed system, rather than inhering in concentrated form within
            any particular node. The simplest model for such a system is a dynamic
            triangle, comparable to the circuit of paper-scissors-stone, in which
            power <em>flows</em> nonlinearly, or <em>circulates</em>. Thus
            conceived, a constitution is a design for the dissolution of power
            reservoirs, in which the optimum administrative function of each node is
            a check, or restriction, on the effective authority of nodes downstream
            (within a circular arrangement). The achievement of dynamically stable
            governmental self-limitation through strategic fragmentation (of
            functions and powers) is the constitutional objective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, monarchism represents a definitive abandonment of this
            constitutional ambition. It contends that, since sovereignty cannot be
            effectively or permanently dismantled, rational attention is better
            focused upon its concentrated expression. The monarchist case is able to
            draw great sustenance from the manifest degeneration of republican
            constitutionalism — most obviously within the United States of America —
            where its most radically deteriorated possibility, mass democracy,
            betrays a scarcely contestable inferiority to monarchical government in
            each day’s news headlines. It needs to be emphasized at this point that
            any constitutional republicanism which is less anti-democratic than
            absolute monarchy is, in that regard, contemptible. Neoreaction is
            essentially anti-democratic, but only hypothetically monarchist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Republicanism, like monarchy, has a rich and deep historical archive of
            examples to draw upon, dating back to classical antiquity. The confusion
            between republican government and democracy is a recent and unfortunate
            eventuality. The historical reasons for this confusion are by no means
            trivial, but nor do they point inexorably to the monarchist conclusion.
            It is especially important to consider the possibility that the demotic
            destruction of monarchical regimes, and of functional republics, has
            been a parallel process, rather than a succession (in which
            republicanism served as an intermediate stage of political
            disorganization). A detailed historical analysis of the 1848 revolutions
            would bring out some of the complexity this topic introduces. In
            particular, it raises the question why the model of the Dutch Republic
            (1581-1795) was unable to offer a template for constitutional government
            of effective relevance beyond the Anglosphere. From the perspective of
            constitutional republicanism, the limited influence of the Dutch example
            marks a fatal historical bifurcation, exposing the European peoples to a
            calamitous bi-polar struggle between monarchical and democratic forces
            (from which our present ruin was hatched). It is also immediately
            evident from this perspective that the emergence of advanced
            capitalistic economic organization is inextricable from the propagation
            of the Dutch model (transplanted into the UK by the Glorious Revolution
            of 1688, and from there to the Anglophone New World). Since capitalism
            epitomizes cybernetic closure — a system without uncontrolled nodes —
            these connections should not surprise us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because monarchism dismisses the possibility of cybernetic closure, and
            thus asks us to accept the inevitability of uncontrolled nodes, or
            concentrated sovereignty, it necessarily compromises on the prospects of
            meritocratic selection. It argues, soundly enough, that we can do far
            worse than kings, and have done so, but in making this case it falls far
            short of the selective mechanism for excellence that capitalism
            routinely demonstrates. When Moldbug compares a monarch to a CEO, it is
            with the understanding that — under approximate free-enterprise
            conditions — business leadership has been socially sifted for rare
            talent in a way that dynastic succession cannot possibly match. The fact
            that the outcome of democratic-electoral selection is reliably far worse
            than the monarchical alternative does not indicate that ‘royalty’
            represents an impressive solution to the meritocratic problem — it is
            simply less appalling than the one presently prevalent among our
            contemporary political systems. It is capitalism that has found the
            solution, from which any rational politics would seek to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            That monarchy is superior to democracy is a point of secure
            neoreactionary consensus, but this is a remarkably low benchmark to set.
            That there is anything beyond it recommending the return of kings
            remains an unsettled matter of dispute.

            Foseti and Jim have been conducting an argument in slow motion, without
            quite connecting. Much of this has been occurring in sporadic blog
            comments, and occasional remarks. It would be very helpful of me to
            reconstruct it here, through a series of meticulous links. I’ll begin by
            failing at that. (Any assistance offered in piecing it together,

            Despite its elusiveness, I think it is the most important intellectual
            engagement taking place anywhere in the field of political philosophy.
            Its point of departure is the Moldbuggian principle that ‘sovereignty is
            conserved’ and everything that follows from it, both theoretically and
            practically. The virtual conclusion of this controversy is the central
            assertion of Dark Enlightenment, which we do not yet comprehend.

            say ultimate (or sovereign) — political authority be constrained?
            Moldbug’s answer is ‘no’. A constrained authority is a superseded
            authority, or delegated power. To limit government is to exceed, and
            thus supplant it. It follows that ‘constitutionalism’ is a masked
            usurpation, and the task of realist political theory is to identify the
            usurper. It is this that is apparently achieved through the designation
            of the Cathedral.

          <p>
            To crudely summarize the argument in question, Foseti upholds this chain
            of reasoning, whilst Jim refuses it.  Constitutional issues cannot be
            anything but a distraction from realistic political philosophy if Foseti
            is correct. If Jim’s resistance is sustainable, constitutions matter.

            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/352/">here</a>. It has yet to find
            an articulation that clicks. Eventually, something has to, if we are to
            advance even by a step. So long as the Foseti-Jim argument  falls short
            of mutually-agreeable terms of intellectual engagement, we can be
            confident that this critical controversy remains stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are the rules of contestation? If we knew that, we would know
            everything (that matters to us here). Rules are the whole of the
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            A constitution is a system of rules, formalizing a social game. Among
            these rules are set procedures for the selection of umpires, and umpires
            decide how the rules are to be revised, interpreted, and implemented. 
            The circuit is irreducible. Without accepted rules, a Supreme Court
            justice is no more than a random old guy — prey for the most wretched
            species of street thug. Who has power in a world without rules, Clarence
            Thomas or Trayvon Martin?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet without umpires (or, at least, an umpire-function), rules are simply
            marks on a piece of paper, disconnected from all effective authority.
            “You can’t do that, it’s against the rules!” To the political realist,
            those are the words of a dupe, and everyone knows the rejoinder: “Who’s
            going to stop me, you and who’s army?” It’s enough to get Moldbug
            talking about crypto-locked weaponry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dark Enlightenment knows that it is necessary to be realistic about
            rules. Such realism, lucidly and persuasively articulated, still eludes
            it. That the sovereign rules does not explain the rules of sovereignty,
            and there must be such rules, because the alternative is pure
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/on-power/">force</a>, and that is a
            romantic myth of transparent absurdity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is an uncontroversial fact of real power, it is that force is
            massively economized, and it is critically important that we understand
            what that implies. Moldbug acknowledges exactly this when he identifies
            the real sovereign instance of climaxed Occidental modernity with the
            Cathedral, which is a church (and not an army). Political philosophy
            cannot approach reality before accepting that rules are irreducible,
            which is not to say that they are sufficient,or even (yet) intelligible.
          </p>
          <p>
            One further point on this problem (for now): A model of power that is
            not scale-free is inadequately formulated. If what is held to work for a
            nation state does not work for the world, the conception remains
            incomplete. Do we dream of a global God-Emperor? If not, what do
            royalist claims at a lower level amount to? What does ‘conserved
            sovereignty’ care for borders? They are limits — indeed
            <em>limited government</em> — and that is supposed to be the illusion
            prey to realist critique.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there can be borders, there can be limits, or effective
            fragmentation, and there is nothing real to prevent fragmentation being
            folded from the outside in. If patchworks can work, they are applicable
            at every scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who would choose a king instead of a patchwork? God-Emperor or
            confederacy? That is the question.

            <em>… this fifteen-year journey back to the USSR under the leadership of
              a former KGB lieutenant colonel has shown the world the vicious nature
              and archaic underpinnings of the Russian state’s “vertical power”
              structure, more than any “great and terrible” Putin. With a
              monarchical structure such as this, the country automatically becomes
              hostage to the psychosomatic quirks of its leader. All of his fears,
              passions, weaknesses, and complexes become state policy. If he is
              paranoid, the whole country must fear enemies and spies; if he has
              insomnia, all the ministries must work at night; if he’s a teetotaler,
              everyone must stop drinking; if he’s a drunk—everyone should booze it
              up; if he doesn’t like America, which his beloved KGB fought against,
              the whole population must dislike the United States. A country such as
              this cannot have a predictable, stable future; gradual development is
              extraordinarily difficult.</em>

            As a prophet of the unfolding calamity, Angelo Codevilla has

            class’ was already demonstrably unworthy of Goldwater in 1964. Things

            ruminations on the disintegration of the American party system are
            highly convincing. The death of the Republican Party is a much-deserved
            necessary way-stage to pretty much anything, whatever one’s sense of the
            way. As always, the insightful

            of Richard Fernandez on the topic is not to be missed.

          <p>
            Between even the sharpest conservative analysis, and anything that would
            pass muster amongst reactionaries, a daunting gulf yawns. As Codevilla
            muses in the new <em>Forbes</em> piece:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Representation is the distinguishing feature of democratic
              government. To be represented, to trust that one’s own identity and
              interests are secure and advocated in high places, is to be part of
              the polity. In practice, any democratic government’s claim to the
              obedience of citizens depends on the extent to which voters feel they
              are party to the polity. No one doubts that the absence, loss, or
              perversion of that function divides the polity sharply between rulers
              and ruled.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The confusion between legitimate republican government and political
            representation (‘democracy’) has been <em>the</em> disaster of modern
            history. Until this error is thoroughly purged from statecraft, reason
            will belong with kings.

            <em>A democracy cannot survive as a permanent form of government. It can
              last only until its citizens discover that they can vote themselves
              largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority
              (who vote) will vote for the candidates promising the greatest
              benefits from the public purse, with the result that a democracy will

            As the slide continues, the perennial understanding of anti-demotic
            statecraft (and initiatory insight of the new reaction) appears to be
            going mainstream. Alex Berezow writes
            <a href="http://www.realclearworld.com/blog/2013/04/will_we_enter_a_postdemocratic_world.html">at</a>

            <em>It’s been a rough few years for democracy. Despite that, Westerners
              always seem to assume that the most highly evolved form of government
              is democratic. The trouble with that notion is that, at some point, a
              majority of voters realize they can vote for politicians who promise
              them the most stuff, regardless of whether or not it is good policy or
              financially sustainable. And once that occurs, the country is (perhaps

            Whilst glibly insubstantial by Moldbug standards (of course), the

            Will the ‘post-democratic world’ have a clear principle of political
            legitimacy? The most elegant, by far, would be the introduction of
            commutativity to the slogan of Anglosphere colonial rebellion: ‘No
            taxation without representation.’
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>No representation without taxation</em> restricts legitimacy to
            those regimes in which those who fund government determine its
            structure, scope, and policy, in direct proportion to their
            contribution. The improvements that would result from this integration
            of the State’s fiscal and electoral feedback circuits are too profound
            and numerous to readily outline, but they can be summarized in a single
            expectation: radical, irreversible, and continuous shift to the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the most obvious anticipated objections:<br />
            (1) <em>It’s impractical</em> (Oh yes, only horrors are practical)<br />
            (2) <em>It’s unjust</em> (For soldiers and cops, perhaps, but the
            deleterious effects of complication outweigh the benefits of moral
            nuance)<br />
            (3)
            <em>In the West, at least, Brahmin plutocrats would undo it at the first
              opportunity</em>
            (A sadly plausible prediction — perhaps no Abrahamic culture is capable
            of supporting a sane social order, and will always choose to resolve
            policing problems through expansion of the franchise.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Granting all of these objections, and more, the principle of
            <em>commutative tax-politics</em> still provides one very valuable
            service: it explains what went wrong. Representational hypertrophy
            destroyed the modern constitutional order, based on a one-sided
            interpretation of the demand that government be made accountable for its
            exactions. Balance (commutativity) might well be unobtainable, but it
            isn’t difficult to understand what it would be.

            <a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pellissier20150612">According</a>
            to Mark Waser, the project of replacing human politicians with
            algorithms would yield positive results, far in advance of its nominal
            accomplishment. As he concludes: “I think that AI leadership is a
            tremendous idea, not the least because the path towards it necessarily
            improves human leadership (and civic debate).”
          </p>
          <p>
            The extent to which the deep Anglo tradition tends in this direction is
            easy to under-estimate. <em>Magna Carta</em> was already a beta version
            draft of machine governance, as every serious initiative at
            constitutionalism has been. The principle of
            <em>limited government</em> finds its consummation in the ideal of rigid
            algorithmic constraint, and the impracticality of such an objective in
            no way diminishes the well-springs of motivation behind it. The
            programmatic erosion of political charisma is one obvious spin-off
            benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Anglophone world — at least, until the most recent spasms of its
            degeneration — the call to <em>empower the people</em> has always been
            an unfortunate derivation from attempts to
            <em>disempower government authority</em>, by subjecting it to structural
            checks, and subtracting its discretion to the greatest possible extent.
            Computerizing a fast food restaurant gets you a cheaper hamburger.
            Computerizing government promises something far more deeply attuned to
            ancient political-economic impulses.
          </p>

            As Waser suggests: Merely letting politicians know that their definitive
            abolition is in prospect sends a valuable signal in its own right.
            Perhaps, in the interim, it could even train them to behave more like
            machines.

            <h4 class="post-title">Protocols</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            “Protocol governance can come in many forms, these include bureaucratic
            rules, literal interpretations of religious texts, democracy, proposed
            block chain or P2P governance, statistics based governance, rule of law,
            and any other form of governance which seeks to provide a protocol as
            being ultimately sovereign as opposed to ultimate human judgement,”
            <a href="http://www.newinternationaloutlook.com/2015/09/10/rule-by-protocol/">writes</a>
            NIO.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meaning of ‘protocol’ here? I’m assuming, until corrected, that it’s
            something like: <em>A formalized procedure</em>. If so, it elides a
            critical difference, because while “bureaucratic rules, literal
            interpretations of religious texts,” and constitutions tell people what
            to do, “proposed block chain or P2P governance” doesn’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            A set of instructions opens itself to derision, if it ‘demands’ human
            compliance, without possessing the means to compel it. Constitutions,
            laws, and bureaucracies are massively — and demonstrably — vulnerable to
            subversion, because they require what they cannot enforce. It is
            <em>exactly this problem</em> that has propelled the development of
            software protocols that are intrinsically self-protective. The longest
            section of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin
            <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">paper</a> (#11) is devoted to
            an examination of the system’s automatic defense capabilities. The
            problem is a serious and complicated one, but it is certainly not
            susceptible to resolution by armchair philosophizing about the essence
            of sovereignty, however much this latter
            <a href="http://www.newinternationaloutlook.com/2015/09/13/lies-and-reaction/">proclaims</a>
            its possession of the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Claims to ‘truth’ demand trust, and trust is a social and technical
            <em>problem</em> (of ever increasing urgency). Mere assertion is
            certainly incapable of generating it. Only a <em>trust engine</em> can,
            and that has to be built, if it cannot be simply preserved, which — on
            this at least we are surely agreed? — it could not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is only a stepping stone, and the scale of the step it enables
            remains obscure at this point. What is already clear, however, is that
            the principle of trustless (or open-source, automatically self-policing)
            protocols is concrete, in large part technical, and invulnerable to
            <em>a priori</em> dismissal. The theoretical difficulties involved have
            been largely solved, based upon a series of radical innovations in
            cryptography — public key systems and proof-of-work credentials, among
            others — compared to which the recent ‘advances’ of political
            philosophy, let alone governmental institutions, have been risible at
            best. If
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine</a>
            Agreement is realizable, protocol subversion is exterminable. What then
            remains is productive work, in the direction of automatic or autonomized
            agoras.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carlyle is a lament (admittedly, a rhetorically attractive, and
            insightful one). Satoshi Nakamoto has built something. The former is
            vindicated by progressive socio-political decay, the latter by the
            escape of self-protective catallaxy from the ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within a few decades, most of what still works on this planet will be on
            the blockchain.

            This is excellent. (Adam Back, via Twitter, describes it as the “Best
            article yet on what Bitcoin *is* &amp; why decentralisation is
            necessary”.) The proposal of this post is that the conflict it outlines
            is <em>obviously</em> of massive importance. Those who think the entire
            problem of decentralized protocols is an irrelevant distraction from
            other things, are surely compelled to disagree. The XS position here is
            that <em>trustless decentralization is worth defending</em>. Clearly,
            that presupposes it’s something real (and consequential). As far as the
            NRx discussion is concerned, I’m going to assume that’s the matter at
            stake.

            <h4 class="post-title">Trichotomocracy</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            By 2037 the harsh phases of The Upheaval have finally ended. Western
            Eurasia is ruined and confused, but the fighting has burnt out amongst
            the rubble. In the Far East, the Chinese Confucian Republic has largely
            succeeded in restoring order, and is even enjoying the first wave of
            renewed prosperity. The Islamic civil war continues, but — now almost
            entirely introverted — it is easily quarantined. No one wants to think
            too much about what is happening in Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            The territory of the extinct USA is firmly controlled by the
            Neoreactionary Coalition, whose purchase is strengthened by the flight
            of 20 million Cathedral Loyalists to Canada and Europe (incidentally
            toppling both into terminal chaos). The Provisional Trichotomous
            Council, selected primarily by a process of military promotion and
            delegation from within the major Neoreactionary  guerrilla groups, now
            confronts the task of establishing a restored political order.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1380"></span>It quickly becomes obvious to each of the
            three main Neoreactionary factions that future developments — even if
            these are to include an orderly subdivision of the nation — will
            initially depend upon the institution of a government that balances the
            three broad currents that now dominate the North American continent:
            Ethno-Nationalists (“Genies” or “Rockies”); Theonomists (“Logs” or
            “Sizzlers”); and Techno-Commercialists (“Cyboids” or “Pulpists”). Now
            that the Cathedral has been thoroughly extirpated, significant
            divergences between these three visions of the nation’s future threaten
            to escalate, unpredictably, into dangerous antagonisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since practical realism, rooted in an understanding of path-dependency,
            is a common inheritance of all three factions, there is immediate
            consensus on the need to begin from where things are. Since a virtual
            triangular order of partially-compatible agendas is already reflected in
            the make-up of the Provisional Council, this is recognized as the
            template for an emergent, triadically-structured government — the rising
            Neoreactionary Trichotomocracy, or “Trike”. (A colossal statue of
            Spandrell — the revered white-beard of the Trichotomy — has already been
            erected in the comparatively radiation-free provisional capital of
            Omaha, gazing out Mosaically into the new promised land, a glinting
            ceremonial Samurai sword held triumphantly aloft.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Within a few months, the basic formula for the Trichotomocracy has been
            tweaked into place. It consists of three Compartments, each
            comprehensively dominated by one of the principal factions. Procedures
            for selection of officials is internally determined by each Compartment,
            drawing upon the specific traditions of functional hierarchy honed
            during the Zombie War.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authority is distributed among the Compartments in a triangular circuit.
            Each Compartment has a specific internal and external responsibility —
            its own positive governmental function, as well as an external (and
            strictly negative, or inhibitory) control of the next Compartment. This
            is colloquially known as the ‘Rocky-Sizzler-Pulpist’ system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethno-Nationalist ‘Rockies’ run the Compartment of Security, which
            includes the essential functions of the Executive. It is controlled
            financially by the Compartment of Resources. Its external responsibility
            is the limitation of the Compartment of Law, whose statutes can be
            returned, and ultimately vetoed (but not positively amended), if they
            are found to be inconsistent with practical application. The structure
            of the Compartment of Security broadly coincides with the military chain
            of command. (The Rockies get to decide whether to describe the
            Commander-in -Chief as a constitutional monarch, a supreme warlord, or a
            demi-god of annihilation.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Theonomist ‘Sizzlers’ run the Compartment of Law, which combines
            legislative and judicial functions. For funding purposes, the
            Compartment of Law is subordinated to the Compartment of Security, for
            obvious constitutional reasons. This keeps it small, restricting its
            potential for extravagant legislative activity. Since the Compartment of
            Security also filters legislation (in accordance with a practical
            criterion), the Law of the Trichotomocracy is remarkable for its
            clarity, economy, and concision. The entire edifice of Law, by informal
            understanding, is limited to a single volume of biblical proportions.
            Senior Sizzler officials are expected to memorize it. The external
            responsibility of the Compartment of Law is to restrain the Compartment
            of Resources, by strictly limiting the legality of revenue-raising
            measures (informally bounded to a national ‘tithe’). Internal order of
            the Compartment is determined by the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the
            Neoreactionary Church of the Cosmic Triarchitect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Techno-Commercialist ‘Pulpists’ run the Compartment of Resources, with
            the ‘power of the purse’. As the sole ‘self-funding’ Compartment, it is
            minutely scrutinized by the Compartment of Law, which tightly controls
            its revenue-raising procedures. Dominated by a cabal of extreme
            laissez-faire capitalist and technologists, the Compartment of Resources
            is guided by the mantra <em>economize on all things</em>. It does as
            little as possible, beyond maximally-parsimonious funding of the
            Department of Security, with its own internal operations restricted to
            rigorously Pigovian tax-streamlining, statistical research, and the
            provision of X-Prize-style development incentives. The board of the
            Compartment is filled by the nine largest tax-payers, rotated every
            three years. The board elects a CEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ideological discrepancies between the Compartments make an important
            contribution to the stability of the Trichotomocracy, since they limit
            the potential for re-amalgamation into a tyrannical unity. This is one
            of the twin principles by which its success is to be estimated — the
            perpetuation of durable governmental plurality. The second principle —
            complete immunity from populist pressure — is ensured automatically
            insofar as the Trichotomocracy endures, since none of the Compartments
            are demotically sensitive, and even if this were not the case, each is
            insulated from demotic subversion affecting either of the others.  The
            outcome is a government answerable only to itself, with a self that is
            irreducibly plural, and thus intrinsically self-critical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the light-hand of Trichotomocratic rule, any ‘citizen’ who seeks
            to participate in government, in any way whatsoever, has three choices
            open to them:  (a) Join the Security Services and rise through the
            ranks; (b) Join the Church of the Holy Triarchy and become adept in the
            law; (c) Make enough tax-vulnerable income that it earns a place on the
            National Resources Board. There might, in addition, be career
            opportunities for a very small number of professional administrators,
            depending upon the internal staffing policies of the three Compartments.
            Any other ‘politics’ would be criminal social disorder, although in most
            cases this would probably be treated leniently, due to its complete
            impotence. If sufficiently disruptive, such “relic demo-zombie” behavior
            would be best managed by deportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Questions of local government diversity, secession, and micro-state
            building exceed the terms of this initial Integral-Neoreactionary
            settlement. Such potentials can only further strengthen external
            controls, and thus further constrain the scope of government
            discretion.)
          </p>
          <p>
            ADDED: Even this crude sketch has enough moving parts to breed bugs.
            Glitch-1 (by my reckoning): Pigovian taxes and commutative tax politics
            don’t knit together very well. In combination, they incentivize the
            politically ambitious to move into business activities with high
            negative externalities. Any neat patch for this?

            <em>There is, to the best of my knowledge, no single right and proper
              method to construct a gallows. A few elements are common to just about
              every design, but the grim carpenters’ flourishes of the scaffold
              reflect the tastes of the community and the eye of the builders. There
              is always a raised platform; there are always stairs leading to the
              platform, usually thirteen; there is always a crossbeam around which
              to string the noose; and there is always a trapdoor to launch the
              condemned into the hereafter. Beyond that, the timbers of the frame
              are a matter of discretion. Supporting braces and thick beams are
              common for permanent installations. Temporary gallows will often rely
              on a nock rather than a full cleat to hold the bitter end of the
              killing rope. A shoreside hanging can even rely on a high tide and the
              scuttling claws of the merciless deep to clean up the turgid mess left
              by a dead man dancing. …</em>

              was. Tolerance for two-bit tinpot tyrants was running awfully low, so
              Sacramentarians decided to raise the stakes for would-be petty
              autocrats. “Any citizen can propose any rule change at a rulemoot. To
              do [so], you ascend the Black Gallows, loop a secured noose of your

              minutes only to deliver your proposal and your plea. Then there’s some
              sort of a deliberation process. I think folks can line up to give
              brief comments or something, after which the assembled crowd votes yea
              or nay. If the motion passes, it is now law. If it fails, the lever is

              they aren’t very sure they’ll have the support of the crowd.” I paused

            Excessive populism, certainly, but turned unambiguously in the right
            direction. After a few generations, the genetic selection effects alone
            would have justified it. The model, clear in context, is an
            <em>anti-California</em>. If something like this isn’t tried somewhere,
            social experimentation will have missed out.

            </a>
            <p>
              First thing: “Meta-Neocameralism” isn’t anything new, and it certainly
              isn’t anything post-Moldbuggian. It’s no more than Neocameralism
              apprehended in its most abstract features, through the coining of a
              provisional and dispensable term. (It allows for an acronym that doesn’t
              lead to confusions with North Carolina, while encouraging quite
              different confusions, which I’m pretending not to notice.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Locally (to this blog), the “meta-” is the mark of a prolegomenon*, to a
              disciplined discussion of Neocameralism which has later to take place.
              Its abstraction is introductory, in accordance with something that is
              yet to be re-started, or re-animated, in detail. (For existing detail,
              outside the Moldbug canon itself, look
              <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~peter.a.taylor/moldbug.htm">here</a>.)

              The excellent comment thread
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/fission/">here</a> provides at least
              a couple of crucial clues:

              <em>Neocameralism doesn’t answer questions like that [on the specifics of
                social organization]; instead, it’s a mechanism for answering
                questions like that. … You can ask, “is Coke considered better than RC
                Cola?”, or you can institute capitalism and find out. You can ask,
                “are ethno-nationalist states considered better than mixed states?”,
                or you can institute the patchwork and find out. …

              <em>Neo-cameralism is, if viewed in this light, a ‘political system
                system’, it is not a political system but a system for implementing
                political systems. Of course the same guy who came up with it also
                invented an operating system (a system for implementing software
                systems.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-2302"></span>MNC, then, is not a political prescription,
              for instance a social ideal aligned with techno-commercialist
              preferences. It is an intellectual framework for examining systems of
              governance, <em>theoretically</em> formalized as disposals of sovereign
              property. The <em>social</em> formalization of such systems, which
              Moldbug <em>also</em> advocates, can be parenthesized within MNC. We are
              not at this stage considering the model of a desirable social order, but
              rather the abstract model of social order in general, apprehended
              radically — at the root — where ‘to rule’ and ‘to own’ lack distinct
              meanings. Sovereign property is ‘sovereign’ and ‘primary’ because it is
              not merely a claim, but <em>effective possession</em>. (There is much
              more to come in later posts on the concept of sovereign property, some
              preliminary musings
              <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/quibbles-with-moldbug/">here</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Because MNC is an extremely powerful piece of cognitive technology,
              capable of tackling problems at a number of distinct levels (in
              principle, an unlimited number), it is clarified through segmentation
              into an abstraction cascade. Descending through these levels adds
              concreteness, and tilts incrementally towards normative judgements
              (framed by the hypothetical imperative of <em>effective government</em>,
              as defined within the cascade).
            </p>
            <p>
              (1) The highest level of practical significance (since MNC-theology need
              not delay us) has already been touched upon. It applies to social
              regimes of every conceivable type, assuming only that a systematic mode
              of sovereign property reproduction will essentially characterize each.
              Power is <em>economic</em> irrespective of its relation to modern
              conventions of commercial transaction, because it involves the disposal
              of a real (if obscure) quantity, which is subject to increase or
              decrease over the cyclic course of its deployment. Population,
              territory, technology, commerce, ideology, and innumerable additional
              heterogeneous factors are components of sovereign property (power), but
              their economic character is assured by the possibility — and indeed
              necessity — of more-or-less explicit trade-offs and cost-benefit
              calculations, suggesting an original (if germinal) fungibility, which is
              merely arithmetical coherence. This is presupposed by any estimation of
              growth or decay, success or failure, strengthening or weakening, of the
              kind required not only by historical analysis, but also by even the most
              elementary administrative competence. Without an implicit economy of
              power, no discrimination could be made between improvement and
              deterioration, and no directed action toward the former could be
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The effective cyclic reproduction of power has an external criterion —
              survival. It is not open to any society or regime to decide for itself
              what works. Its inherent understanding of its own economics of power is
              a complex measurement, gauging a relation to the outside, whose
              consequences are life and death. Built into the idea of sovereign
              property from the start, therefore, is an
              <em>accommodation to reality</em>. Foundational to MNC, at the very
              highest level of analysis, is the insight that
              <em>power is checked primordially</em>. On the Outside are wolves,
              serving as the scourge of Gnon. Even the greatest of all imaginable
              God-Kings — awesome Fnargl included — has ultimately to discover
              consequences, rather than inventing them. There is no principle more
              important than this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entropy will be dissipated, idiocy will be punished, the weak will die.
              If the regime refuses to bow to this Law, the wolves will enforce it.
              Social Darwinism is not a choice societies get to make, but a system of
              real consequences that envelops them. MNC is articulated at the level —
              which cannot be transcended — where realism is mandatory for any social
              order. Those unable to create it, through effective government, will
              nevertheless receive it, in the harsh storms of Nemesis. Order is not
              defined within itself, but by the Law of the Outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this highest level of abstraction, therefore, when MNC is asked
              “which type of regimes do you believe in?” the sole appropriate response
              is “those compatible with reality.” Every society known to history — and
              others beside — had a working economy of power, at least for a while.
              Nothing more is required than this for MNC to take them as objects of
              disciplined investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
              (2) Knowing that realism is not an optional regime value, we are able to
              proceed down the MNC cascade with the introduction of a second
              assumption: Civilizations will seek gentler teachers than the wolves. If
              it is possible to acquire some understanding of collapse, it will be
              preferred to the experience of collapse (once the wolves have culled the
              ineducable from history).
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything survivable is potentially educational, even a mauling by the
              wolves. MNC however, as its name suggests, has reason to be especially
              attentive to the most abstract lesson of the Outside — the (logical)
              priority of <em>meta-learning</em>. It is good to discover reality,
              before — or at least not much later than — reality discovers us.
              Enduring civilizations do not merely know things, they know that it is
              important to know things, and to absorb realistic information. Regimes —
              disposing of sovereign property — have a special responsibility to
              instantiate this deutero-culture of learning-to-learn, which is required
              for intelligent government. This is a responsibility they take upon
              themselves because it is demanded by the Outside (and even in its
              refinement, it still smells of wolf).
            </p>
            <p>
              Power is under such compulsion to learn about itself that recursion, or
              intellectualization, can be assumed. Power is selected to check itself,
              which it cannot do without an increase in formalization, and this is a
              matter — as we shall see — of immense consequence. Of necessity, it
              learns-to-learn (or dies), but this lesson introduces a critical tragic
              factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tragedy of power is broadly coincident with modernity. It is not a
              simple topic, and from the beginning two elements in particular require
              explicit attention. Firstly, it encounters the terrifying (second-order)
              truth that practical learning is irreducibly experimental. In going
              ‘meta’ knowledge becomes scientific, which means that failure cannot be
              precluded through deduction, but has to be incorporated into the
              machinery of learning itself. Nothing that cannot go wrong is capable of
              teaching anything (even the accumulation of logical and mathematical
              truths requires cognitive trial-and-error, ventures into dead-ends, and
              the pursuit of misleading intuitions). Secondly, in becoming
              increasingly formalized, and ever more fungible, the disposal of
              sovereign power attains heightened liquidity. It is now possible for
              power to trade itself away, and an explosion of social bargaining
              results. Power can be exchanged for (‘mere’) wealth, or for social
              peace, or channeled into unprecedented forms of radical regime
              philanthropy / religious sacrifice. Combine these two elements, and it
              is clear that regimes enter modernity ’empowered’ by new capabilities
              for experimental auto-dissolution. Trade authority away to the masses in
              exchange for promises of good behavior? Why not give it a try?
            </p>
            <p>
              Cascade Stage-2 MNC thus (realistically) assumes a world in which power
              has become an art of experimentation, characterized by unprecedented
              calamities on a colossal scale, while the economy of power and the
              techno-commercial economy have been radically de-segmented, producing a
              single, uneven, but incrementally smoothed system of exchangeable social
              value, rippling ever outward, without firm limit. Socio-political
              organization, and corporate organization, are still distinguished by
              markers of traditional status, but no longer strictly differentiable by
              essential function.
            </p>
            <p>
              The modern business of government is not ‘merely’ business only because
              it remains poorly formalized. As the preceding discussion suggests, this
              indicates that economic integration can be expected to deepen, as the
              formalization of power proceeds. (Moldbug seeks to accelerate this
              process.) An inertial assumption of distinct ‘public’ and ‘private’
              spheres is quickly disturbed by thickening networks of exchange,
              swapping managerial procedures and personnel, funding political
              ambitions, expending political resources in commercial lobbying efforts,
              trading economic assets for political favors (denominated in votes), and
              in general consolidating a vast, highly-liquid reservoir of amphibiously
              ‘corporacratic’ value, indeterminable between ‘wealth’ and ‘authority’.
              Wealth-power inter-convertibility is a reliable index of political
              modernity.
            </p>
            <p>
              MNC does not <em>decide</em> that government <em>should</em> become a
              business. It recognizes that government <em>has</em> become a business
              (dealing in fungible quantities). However, unlike private business
              ventures, which dissipate entropy through bankruptcy and market-driven
              restructuring, governments are reliably the worst run businesses in
              their respective societies, functionally crippled by defective,
              structurally-dishonest organizational models, exemplified most
              prominently by the democratic principle:
              <em>government is a business that should be run by its customers</em>
              (but actually can’t be). Everything in this model that isn’t a lie is a
              mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the second (descending) level of abstraction, then, MNC is still not
              recommending anything except theoretical clarity. It proposes:<br />
              a) Power is destined to arrive at experimental learning processes<br />
              b) As it learns, it formalizes itself, and becomes more fungible<br />
              c) Experiments in fungible power are vulnerable to disastrous
              mistakes<br />
              d) Such mistakes have in fact occurred, in a near-total way<br />
              e) For deep historical reasons, techno-commercial business organization
              emerges as the preeminent template for government entities, as for any
              composite economic agent. It is in terms of this template that modern
              political dysfunction can be rendered (formally) intelligible.
            </p>
            <p>
              (3) Take the MNC abstraction elevator down another level, and it’s still
              more of an analytic tool than a social prescription. (That’s a good
              thing, <em>really</em>.) It tells us that every government, both extant
              and potential, is most accessible to rigorous investigation when
              apprehended as a <em>sovereign corporation</em>. This approach alone is
              able to draw upon the full panoply of theoretical resources, ancient and
              modern, because only in this way is power tracked in the same way it has
              actually developed (in tight alignment with a still-incomplete trend).
            </p>
            <p>
              The most obvious objections are, <em>sensu stricto</em>, romantic. They
              take a predictable (which is not to say a casually dismissible) form.
              Government — if perhaps only lost or yet-unrealized government — is
              associated with ‘higher’ values than those judged commensurable with the
              techno-commercial
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/monkey-business/">economy</a>, which
              thus sets the basis for a critique of the MNC ‘business ontology’ of
              governance as an illegitimate intellectual reduction, and ethical
              vulgarization. To quantify authority as power is already suspect. To
              project its incremental liquidation into a general economy, where
              leadership integrates — ever more seamlessly — with the price system,
              appears as an abominable symptom of modernist nihilism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loyalty (or the intricately-related concept of <em>asabiyyah</em>)
              serves as one exemplary redoubt of the romantic cause. Is it not
              repulsive, even to entertain the possibility that loyalty might have a
              price? Handle addresses this directly in the comment
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/fission/">thread</a> already cited
              (24/03/2014 at 1:18 am). A small sample captures the line of his
              engagement:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Loyalty-preservation incentivizing programs are various and highly
                sophisticated and span the spectrum everywhere from frequent flier
                miles to ‘clubs’ that are so engrossing and time consuming in such as
                to mimic the fulfillment of all the community, socialization, and
                identarian psychological functions that would make even the
                hardest-core religious-traditionalist jealous. Because lots of people
                are genetically programmed with this coordination-subroutine that is
                easily exploitable in a context far removed from its evolutionary
                origins. Sometimes brands ‘deserve’ special competitive loyalty
                (‘German engineering’!) and sometimes they don’t (Tylenol-branded
                paracetamol).</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              There is vastly more that can, and will, be said in prosecution of this
              dispute, since it is perhaps the single most critical driver of NRx
              fission, and it is not going to endure a solution. The cold MNC claim,
              however, can be pushed right across it. Authority is for sale, and has
              been for centuries, so that any analysis ignoring this exchange nexus is
              an historical evasion. Marx’s M-C-M’, through which monetized capital
              reproduces and expands itself through the commodity cycle, is
              accompanied by an equally definite M-P-M’ or P-M-P’ cycle of power
              circulation-enhancement through monetized wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              A tempting reservation, with venerable roots in traditional society, is
              to cast doubt upon the prevalence of such exchange networks, on the
              assumption that power — possibly further dignified as ‘authority’ —
              enjoys a qualitative supplement relative to common economic value, such
              that it cannot be retro-transferred. Who would swap authority for money,
              if authority cannot be bought (and is, indeed, “beyond price”)? But this
              ‘problem’ resolves itself, since the first person to sell political
              office — or its less formal equivalent — immediately demonstrates that
              it can no less easily be purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the earliest, most abstract stage of this MNC outline, it has been
              insisted that
              <em>power has to be evaluated economically, by itself, if anything like
                practical calculation directed towards its increase is to be
                possible</em>. Once this is granted, MNC analysis of the governmental entity in
              general as an economic processor — i.e. a business — acquires
              irresistible momentum. If loyalty, <em>asabiyyah</em>, virtue, charisma
              and other elevated (or ‘incommensurable’) values are
              <em>power factors</em>, then they are already inherently
              self-economizing within the calculus of statecraft. The very fact that
              they contribute, determinately, to an overall estimation of strength and
              weakness, attests to their implicit economic status. When a business has
              charismatic leadership, reputational capital, or a strong culture of
              company loyalty, such factors are monetized as asset values by financial
              markets. When one Prince surveys the ‘quality’ of another’s domain, he
              already estimates the likely expenses of enmity. For modern military
              bureaucracies, such calculations are routine. Incommensurable values do
              not survive contact with defense budgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, however ominous this drift (from a romantic perspective),
              <em>MNC does not tell anybody how to design a society</em>. It says only
              that an effective government will necessarily look, to it, like a
              well-organized (sovereign) business. To this one can add the riders:<br />
              a) Government effectiveness is subject to an external criterion,
              provided by a selective trans-state and inter-state mechanism. This
              might take the form of Patchwork pressure (Dynamic Geography) in a
              civilized order, or military competition in the wolf-prowled wilderness
              of Hobbesian chaos.<br />
              b) Under these conditions, MNC calculative rationality can be expected
              to be compelling for states themselves, whatever their variety of social
              form. Some (considerable) convergence upon norms of economic estimation
              and arrangement is thus predictable from the discovered contours of
              reality. There are things that will fail.

                expressed. […] The first is the capitalist. As Adam Smith noted, the
                best corporations (by all measures) are the ones that are operated for
                clear, measurable and selfish motives. […] The second is the
                communist. In this system, corporations are run for the benefit of
                everyone in the world. […] Unsurprisingly, corporations run on the
                latter principle have found an incredibly large number of ways to
                suck. Not coincidentally, so have 20th Century governments run on the
                same principle. […] I think it’s nearly impossible to overstate the
                ways in which everyone would be better off if we had an efficiently,
                effective, and responsive government.</em>

              <a href="https://gist.github.com/jart/b73868081a5e1a1c5cf0">reminder</a>
              of where NRx came from:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Let me quickly explain my reactionary theory of history, which comes
                from reading weird old forgotten books such as the above. Note that
                this theory is quite simple. Depending on your inclinations, you may
                regard this as a good thing or a bad thing.</em>
            </p>
            <em> </em>
            <p>
              <em>In order to get to the reactionary theory of history, we need a
                reactionary theory of government. History, again, is interpretation,
                and interpretation requires theory. I’ve described this theory before
                under the name of neocameralism, but on a blog it never hurts to be a
                little repetitive.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-4800"></span><em>First: government is not a mystical or mysterious institution. A
                government is simply a group of people working together for a common
                aim, ie, a corporation. Whether a government is good or bad is not
                determined by who its employees are or how they are selected. It is
                determined by whether the actions of the government are good or
                bad.</em>
            </p>
            <em>
              <p>
                Second: the only difference between a government and a “private
                corporation” is that the former is sovereign: it has no higher
                authority to which it can appeal to protect its property. A sovereign
                corporation owns its territory, and maintains that ownership by
                demonstrating unchallenged control. It is stable if no other party,
                internal or external, has any incentive to attack it. Especially in
                the nuclear age, it is not difficult to deter prospective attackers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third: a good government is a well-managed sovereign corporation. Good
                government is efficient management. Efficient management is profitable
                management. A profitable government has no incentive to break its
                promises, abuse its citizens (who are its capital), or attack its
                neighbors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fourth: efficient management can be implemented by the same techniques
                in sovereign corporations as in nonsovereign ones. The company’s
                profit is distributed equally to holders of negotiable shares. The
                shareholders elect a board, which selects a CEO.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fifth: although the full neocameralist approach has never been tried,
                its closest historical equivalents to this approach are the
                18th-century tradition of enlightened absolutism as represented by
                Frederick the Great, and the 21st-century nondemocratic tradition as
                seen in lost fragments of the British Empire such as Hong Kong,
                Singapore and Dubai. These states appear to provide a very high
                quality of service to their citizens, with no meaningful democracy at
                all. They have minimal crime and high levels of personal and economic
                freedom. They tend to be quite prosperous. They are weak only in
                political freedom, and political freedom is unimportant by definition
                when government is stable and effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sixth: the comparative success of the American and European postwar
                systems appears to be due to their abandonment of democratic politics
                as a practical mechanism of government, in favor of a civil-service
                Beamtenstaat in which democratic politicians are increasingly
                symbolic. The post-communist civil-service states, China and Russia,
                appear to be converging on the same system, although their stability
                is ensured primarily by direct military authority, rather than by a
                system of managed public opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seventh: the post-democratic civil-service state, while not utterly
                disastrous, is not the end of history. It has two problems. One, the
                size and complexity of its regulatory system tends to increase without
                bound, resulting in economic stagnation and general apathy. Two, more
                critically, it can neither abolish democratic politics formally, nor
                defend itself against changes in information flow that may destabilize
                public opinion. Notably, the rise of the Internet disrupts the
                feedback loop between public education and political power, allowing
                noncanonical ideas to flourish. If these ideas are both rationally
                compelling and politically delegitimating, the state is threatened.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eighth: therefore, productive political efforts should focus on
                peacefully terminating, restructuring and decentralizing the
                20th-century civil-service state along neocameralist lines. The ideal
                result is a planet of thousands, even tens of thousands, of
                independent city-states, each managed for profit by its shareholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that this perspective has nothing at all in common with the
                Universalist theory of government. Note also the simplicity of the
                transition that it suggests should have happened, from monarchy as a
                family business to a modern corporate structure with separate board
                and CEO, eliminating the vagaries of the hereditary principle.
              </p>

            <p>
              <em>Now let’s look – from this reactionary perspective – at what actually
                did happen. …

                residents and employees, up to and certainly including the chief
                executive. If the shareholders cannot dismiss the CEO of the realm by
                voting according to proper corporate procedures, a total security

                The standard Patchwork remedy for this problem is the
                <strong>cryptographic chain of command</strong>. Ultimately, power
                over the realm truly rests with the shareholders, because they use a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">secret sharing</a>
                or similar cryptographic algorithm to maintain control over its root
                keys. Authority is then delegated to the board (if any), the CEO and
                other officers, and thence down into the military or other security
                forces. At the leaves of the tree are computerized weapons, which will

                Taste the pain, traitors. (Needless to say, the dependence of this
                design on 21st-century technology is ample explanation of why history
                has not bequeathed us anything like the joint-stock realm. It was

              <em>It is very hard to show that any new form of government is superior
                to that practiced now. It is even harder to show that any new form of
                government is superior to any practiced ever. […] Nonetheless, unless
                these problems are not just hard but actually unsolvable, innovation
                in the form of government is possible. … Certainly, the very idea of
                innovation in government should not frighten you. If it does, there is
                no point at all in thinking about government. This is conservatism to
                the point of mental disorder. I simply cannot contend with it, and I
                refuse to try. If you cannot set yourself outside your own beliefs and
                prejudices, you are not capable of normal civilized discourse.</em>

            <p>
              Neocameralism is not (simply) reactionary because it has never been
              fully instantiated up to this time. It is a proposed political-economic
              innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Let’s start with my ideal world – the world of thousands, preferably
                even tens of thousands, of neocameralist city-states and ministates,
                or neostates. The organizations which own and operate these neostates
                are for-profit sovereign corporations, or sovcorps. For the moment,
                let’s assume a one-to-one mapping between sovcorp and neostate. […]
                Let’s pin down the neocameralist dramatis personae by identifying the
                people who work for a sovcorp as its <strong>agents</strong>, the
                people or organizations which collectively own it as its
                <strong>subscribers</strong>, and the people who live in its neostate
                as its <strong>residents</strong>.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              A Neocameral ‘neostate’ is not owned by its residents
              <em>or its agents</em>. Its ‘monarch’ (or ‘CEO’) is
              <em>an executive appointment</em>. (90% of all confusion about
              Neocameralism, and Neoreaction in general, stems from a failure to grasp
              this elementary point.) Note: ‘subscribers’ (plural). More coming on
              this immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-7120"></span><em>Every patch of land on the planet has a primary owner, which is its
                sovcorp. Typically, these owners will be large, impersonal
                corporations. We call them sovcorps because they’re
                <strong>sovereign</strong>. You are sovereign if you have the power to
                render any plausible attack on your primary property, by any other
                sovereign power, unprofitable. In other words, you maintain
                <strong>general deterrence</strong>. […] (Sovereignty is a flat,
                peer-to-peer relationship by definition. The concept of hierarchical
                sovereignty is a contradiction in terms. …) […] The business of a
                sovcorp is to make money by deterring aggression. Since human
                aggression is a serious problem, preventing it should be a good
                business. Moreover, the existence of unprofitable governments in your
                vicinity is serious cause for concern, because unprofitable
                governments tend to have strange decision structures and do weird,
                dangerous things. […] (Nuclear deterrence (mutual assured destruction)
                is only one small class of deterrent designs. To deter is to render
                predictably unprofitable. Predictably unprofitable violence is
                irrational. Irrational violence is certainly not unheard of. But it is
                much, much rarer than you may think. Most of the violence in the world
                today is quite rational, IMHO.) […] General deterrence is a complex
                topic which deserves its own post. For the moment, assume that every
                square inch of the planet’s surface is formally owned by some sovcorp,
                that no one disagrees on the borders, and that deterrence between
                sovcorps is absolute.</em>

            <p>
              Patchwork is a (transcendentally) <em>flat network</em>. No global
              sovereign. At the ultimate level of its instantiation, it consists of
              P2P connections between <em>independent nodes</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>This does not solve the problem of constructing a stable sovcorp. The
                central problem of governance is the old Latin riddle: who guards the
                guardians? The joint-stock corporate design solves the central problem
                by entrusting guardianship in the collective decisions of the
                corporation’s owners, voting not by head but by percentage of profit
                received. […] The joint-stock model is hundreds of years old. It is as
                proven as proven can be. […] … However, in the sovereign context, the
                corporate joint-stock ownership and decision structure faces serious
                challenges which do not exist for a conventional secondary
                corporation. […] In the conventional secondary corporation, the
                control of the owners is unchallenged and unchallengeable, at least as
                long as the sovereign’s rule of corporate law is functioning properly.
                The corporation is incorporated under the oversight of a sovereign
                protector, or <strong>sponsor</strong>. This is what makes it a

            <p>The Neocameral organizational problem is here defined.</p>

              <em>… classical political thought concurred in considering
                <strong>imperio in imperium</strong>, ie, internal subauthorities
                powerful enough to resist or even control the center, a political
                solecism. In case you are not too special to have ever worked in a
                cube, you are probably aware that
                <strong>imperio in imperium</strong> is a solecism in Powerpointia as
                well. One small difficulty, however, is that
                <strong>imperio in imperium</strong> means basically the same thing as
                <strong>separation of powers</strong>. Hm. […] Internal management in
                modern Western corporations is pretty good. At least by the standards
                of modern government, <strong>imperio in imperium</strong> is
                nonexistent. (It should not be confused with the normal practice of
                internal accounting, which does not in any way conflict with an
                absolute central authority and a single set of books.)</em>

              The model for avoidance of <em>imperio in imperium</em> is joint-stock

              <em>Briefly, there are two options for sovcorp governance on a
                neocameralist patchwork planet. One is
                <strong>cross-listing</strong> and the other is
                <strong>cryptogovernance</strong>. In cross-listing, sovcorps list on
                each other’s secondary exchanges, taking great care to select only the
                most reputable sponsors, and demanding a backdoor in which they can
                switch sponsors at the slightest hint of weirdness. […] Cross-listing
                can probably be made to work. However, it is dangerous as a single
                line of defence. For an ideal sovcorp, it should be combined with some
                degree of cryptogovernance. […] Cryptogovernance is any system of
                corporate government in which all formal decisions are endorsed and
                verified cryptographically. A sponsor can still be very useful for
                cryptogovernance, but it is not required. Shareholders in a
                cryptogoverned corporation – known as <strong>subscribers</strong> –
                use private keys to sign their contributions to its governance. They
                may or may not be anonymous, depending on the corporation’s rules. […]
                If you are an American, have you ever wondered what the letters SA, or
                similar, which you see all the time in the names of European
                companies, mean? They mean “anonymous society.” If this strikes you as
                weird, it shouldn’t.</em>

              Do any <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/hrx-ii/">#HRx</a> types still
              think this is their universe?
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The neat thing about cryptographic government (which is actually much
                easier than it sounds – we’re talking a few thousand lines of code,
                max) is that it can be connected directly to the sovcorp’s second line
                of defense: a cryptographically-controlled military. […] Cryptographic
                weapons control, in the form of permissive action links, is already
                used for the world’s most powerful weapons. However, there is nothing
                in principle preventing it from being extended down to small arms –
                for example, with a radio activation code transmitted over a mesh
                network. Military formations loyal to the CEO will find that their
                weapons work. Rebel formations will find that theirs don’t. The
                outcome is obvious. Moreover, the neocameralist state has no incentive
                to deal kindly with traitors, so there is no way for an attacker to
                repeatedly probe the system’s weaknesses. […] The one difficulty with
                cryptographic weapons control is that it fails, and devolves into
                simple military rule, if the authorization keys are kept anywhere near
                the weapons. Weaponholders can gather unlocked or noncryptographic
                weapons secretly, and use them to arrest the keyholders – for example,
                the directors of the sovcorp. […] The solution is simple: keep the
                sovcorp’s directors, or whoever has ultimate control of the highest
                grade of military keys, outside the sovcorp’s neostate. Even if the
                CEO himself rebels, along with all of his subordinates, any formation
                loyal to the directors can defeat them. The result is internal
                military stability.</em>

              Agree with where Moldbug is going with this, or not, the line of thought
              is profoundly illustrative of the Neocameral problem, as originally
              conceived, which lies within the general framework of
              <em>cryptographic property protection</em> (and not that of romantic
              political attachment).

              Hurlock has a valuable
              <a href="http://hurlock-151.tumblr.com/post/102634665466/property-sovereignty-and-formalism">post</a>
              on the concept of property, especially in its relation to sovereignty,
              and formalization. Since (Moldbuggian) Neocameralism can be construed as
              a renovated theory of property, crucially involving all three of these
              terms, the relevance of the topic should require no defense. The
              profound failure of enlightenment philosophy to satisfactorily determine
              the meaning of property has been a hostage to fortune whose dire
              consequences have yet to be fully exhausted. (Within the NRx generally,
              the question of property is deeply under-developed, and — with a very
              few exceptions — there is little sign of serious attention being paid to
              it.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The enlightenment failure has been to begin its analysis of property
              from the problem of <em>justification</em>. This not only throws it into
              immediate ideological contention, submitting it to politics, and thus to
              relentless left-drift, it also places insurmountable obstacles in the
              path of rigorous understanding. To depart from an axiom of legitimate
              original property acquisition through work, as Locke does, is already
              proto-Marxist in implication, resting on philosophically hopeless
              metaphor, such as that of ‘mixing’ labor with things. It is property
              that defines work (over against non-productive behavior), not the
              inverse. As Hurlock notes, Moldbug’s approach is the correct one.
              ‘Property’ — as a social category — is a legitimation of control. It
              cascades conceptually from sovereignty, and not from production.
            </p>
            <p>
              These matters will inevitably become intellectually pressing, due to the
              current technocommercial <em>restoration</em> of money, exemplified by
              the innovation of Bitcoin (in its expansive sense, as the blockchain).
              Control is undergoing cryptographic formalization, from which all
              consistent apprehension of ‘property’ will follow. Property, in the end,
              is not sociopolitical recognition of rights, but <em>keys</em>. What you
              can lock and unlock is yours. The rest is merely more or less serious
              talk, that only contingently <em>compiles</em>. This is what hacker
              culture has already long understood in its specific (thedish) usage of
              ‘owned’. There’s no point crying to the government about having paid
              good money for your computer, if Nerdgodz or some other irritating
              15-year-old is running it as a Bitcoin-mining facility from his mother’s
              basement. The concreteness of ‘might is right’ once looked like a parade
              ground, but increasingly it is <em>running functional code</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Formalization isn’t a detached exercise in philosophical reflection, or
              even a sociopolitical and legal consensus, it’s functional
              technocommercial cryptography. Defining property outside the terms of
              this eventuation is an exercise in arbitrary sign-shuffling. Those with
              the keys can simply smile at the surrounding senseless noise. As Moldbug
              anticipates, with rigorously coded control, there’s nothing further to
              argue about.

              <h4 class="post-title">Laffer Drift</h4>
            </a>
            <p>
              One dark and fearsome crag, half-lost among the Himalayan mountain range
              of uncleared obligations stretched out before this blog, is a promise to
              devote a post (or several) to Mencius Moldbug’s Neocameral regime model.
              The opportunity to make a small payment against this debt having arisen,
              I am eagerly seizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A relatively marginal but consistent feature in Moldbug’s model is the
              tendency of Neocameral tax rates to approximate to the Laffer maximum.
              Since Moldbug aims to rationalize the theory of government, under the
              presumption of its ineliminably self-interested nature, this suggestion
              scarcely requires an argument (and in fact does not receive one).
              Government will always tend to maximize its resources, and Arthur
              Laffer’s graph of optimum revenue-raising tax rates seems to show the
              way this is done. A Neocameral regime tends the economy of a country
              exactly as a farmer tends a herd of animals — without ever forgetting
              that ultimate redemption occurs in the abattoir.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-957"></span>There is a problem with this assumption,
              however, which is that the very idea of a Laffer maximum tax rate is
              incomplete. By coordinating tax rates (on the x-axis) with tax revenues
              (on the y-axis), the Laffer curve demolishes the crude economic
              intuition that revenue rises continuously with tax rates. Through the
              <em>a priori</em> postulate that a 100% tax rate yields zero revenue,
              Laffer demonstrates that revenue maximization has to be located
              somewhere in the central region of the curve. Its exact location — as
              determined by the shape of the curve — is dependent upon empirical
              factors, such as incentive effects, and cannot be deduced by pure
              theory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Missing from the Laffer curve is time, and thus
              <em>dynamic revenue projection</em>. This is especially important to the
              Neocameral model, since a central failure to be rectified through
              reactionary democracy-suppression is the systematic heightening of
              time-preference, or collapsing economic time-horizons, with which
              democracy is inextricably bound. The Neocameral state is justified by
              its capacity for time-extended economic rationality, and this is not
              something that the simple Laffer curve can reflect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding time to Laffer graphs is not a complex task. All that is required
              is a multiplication of curves, constituting a time series, with each
              curve corresponding to a time-horizon. Rather than a single curve, such
              a graph would consist of a 1-year curve, a 2-year curve, a 3-year curve
              … and out to whichever extended prospect was considered appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              If levels of taxation were irrelevant to economic growth rates, then
              each curve would be identical, and this exercise would lack all
              significance. If, alternatively, taxation effected growth in a
              predictable direction, then the Laffer curves would steadily drift as
              time-horizons were expanded.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin with the improbable case, assume that extraction of resources
              from private property owners tends to increase economic growth. Then
              each successive Laffer curve would drift to the right, as the tax base
              expands under the beneficent impact of lavish government spending. A
              small and efficient government, by depriving the economy of its
              attention, would steadily shrink the tax base relative to its potential,
              and thus reduce the total level of takings (as a function of time).
            </p>
            <p>
              If, far more plausibly, taxation suppresses growth, then each successive
              curve will drift to the left. The Laffer maximum tax rate for a 1-year
              time horizon will be revealed as ever more excessive as the horizon is
              dilated, and the shortfall of the depredated economy is exposed  with
              increasing clarity. The more extended the time-horizon, the further to
              the left the <em>dynamic</em> Laffer maximum has to be. As economic
              far-sightedness stretches out into the distance, an
              authoritarian-realist regime converges with anarcho-capitalism, since
              growth-maximization increasingly dominates its revenue projections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of all the reasons to distrust the Neocameral model, an intrinsic
              tendency to short-term Laffer-max revenue raising cannot be among them.
            </p>

              My own response to Gurri is still embryonic, but I already suspect that
              it diverges from Handle’s to some degree. Rather than defending the
              ‘technocratic’ element in the Moldbug Patchwork-Neocameral model, I
              agree with Gurri that this is a real problem, although (of course) I am
              far more sympathetic to the underlying intellectual project. Unlike
              Gurri — who in this crucial respect represents a classical
              liberal position at its most thoughtful — Moldbug does not conceive
              democracy as a discovery process, illuminated by analogy to market
              dynamics and organic social evolution. On the contrary, it is a ratchet
              mechanism that successively distances the political realm from feedback
              sensitivity, due to its character as a closed loop (or state church)
              sensitive only to a public opinion it has itself manufactured. As the
              Cathedral expands, its adaptation to reality progressively attenuates.
              The result is that every effective discovery process — whether economic,
              scientific, or of any other kind — is subjected to ever-more radical
              subversion by political influences whose only ‘reality principle’ is
              internal: based on closed-circuit social manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-2098"></span>Democracy is thus, strictly speaking, a
              production of collective insanity, or dissociation from reality.
              Moldbug’s solution, therefore, <em>can only be</em> an attempt to
              re-embed governance in an effective feedback system. Since it is already
              evident that democratic mechanisms, rather than providing such feedback,
              reliably deepen dissociation, reality signal has to come from elsewhere.
              To return to an adaptive condition, governance has to simultaneously
              disconnect from popular opinion (voice) and reconnect to a registry of
              actual — rather than ideologically spun — performance. The communication
              medium for the uncontaminated feedback required by
              <em>sensible</em> government is exit traffic within the Patchwork
              (comparable in its operation to revealed consumer preference within
              marketplaces).
            </p>
            <p>
              The great difficulty that then emerges — casting the entire Neocameral
              schema into question — is the requirement for an ‘undiscovered’ or
              ‘technocratic’ leap, from an environment of progressively decaying
              discovery or selection pressure, into one in which discovery can once
              again take place. Neoreaction confronts a very real transition problem,
              and Gurri is quite right to point this out. Handle is no less right when
              he insists that the ‘conservative’ option of accommodation to the
              democratic social process in motion is profoundly untenable, because
              <em>discovery deterioration is essential to the democratic trend</em>.
              Maladaptation to reality ceases to be correctable under Cathedral
              governance, and recognition of this malign condition is the defining
              neoreactionary insight.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we stay on the train we will be smashed into a consummate insanity,
              but to leap is technocratic error (unsupported by discovery). As for
              prevarication: The intensification of this dilemma can be confidently
              expected from the mere continuance of the democratic process, dominated
              by the degenerative politics of the madhouse, and scrambling all social
              information. It is in this precarious position that the task of a
              rigorous evaluation of the Neocameral schema, along with its prospects
              for renovation or replacement, has to take place.

            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-deal/">
              <h4 class="post-title">The Deal</h4>
            </a>
            <p>
              NRx repudiates public politics. Turn that around, and it’s the thesis:
              <em>Politics happens in private</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically — as a political philosophy — NRx advocates the
              privatization of government. It makes a public case for that, in the
              abstract, but only for purposes of informational and theoretical
              optimization. It is not, ever, <em>doing</em> politics in public, but
              only thinking about it under conditions of minimal intelligence
              security. Concrete execution of political strategy occurs through
              private deals.
            </p>
            <p>
              The currency of such deals was
              <a
                href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2007/05/magic-of-symmetric-sovereignty.html">formalized</a>
              by Mencius Moldbug, as <em>primary</em> (or <em>fungible sovereign</em>)
              <em>property</em>. It corresponds to the conversion — whether notional
              or actual — of hard power into business assets. This conversion is what
              ‘formalism’ means. It’s an important contribution to political
              philosophy, and political economy, but it’s also a negotiating position.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cries for (public) <em>Action!</em> will always be with us, at least
              until things are radically sorted out. They should be ignored. No public
              action is serious.
            </p>
            <p>
              The serious thing is <em>the deal</em>, which substitutes for any
              semblance of revolution, and also for regime perpetuation. Shadow NRx —
              which acts outside the sphere of public visibility — is a political
              vulture fund. This blog does not want to know who, or what, it is. Its
              deep secrecy is the same as its reality. Our concern is restricted to
              the way it necessarily acts, in compliance with an absolute principle.
              We ask only: <em>What does the deal have to be like?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-6224"></span>In its essence it is this:
              <em>Stand down effective capabilities for regime preservation in exchange
                for primary property stock</em>. The form thus indicates the relevant principals — holders of the keys
              to hard power. What is on offer for them, as NRx develops in reality
              (the shadows), is formalization of their implicit social authority,
              through the emergence of a new — ultimate or ‘transcendental’ —
              commercial medium. The whole of Neocameral transition is realized
              through this.<br />
              “Turn everything you have into rigorous code, and everything changes. We
              can help with the technicalities.”<br />
              “Why should I do that?”<br />
              “It will be worth it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s the vulture fund aspect. Hard power capability is systematically
              under-valued under conditions of Cathedral-demotic degeneracy, since it
              is squandered on the ever-more inefficient preservation of an insane
              religious establishment — the Atheo-Oecumenic Ecclesiocracy — and
              compensated accordingly, from the charred scraps of chronic policy
              disaster. After dysfunctional domestic social programs, election buying,
              and Jacobin foreign policy crusades have been paid for, what remains to
              reward competent governance?
            </p>
            <p>
              Administrative capability is slaved to the Cathedral, which means to a
              zealous pursuit of impossible objectives, and thus accelerating waste.
              As a business opportunity (“We can help with the technicalities”), the
              attraction of defection grows, therefore, in strict proportion to the
              triumph of progressivism. This is critical, because the threshold risks
              of transition are immense, and <em>the deal</em> has to cover them.

              It’s probably unrealistic right now to think the non-demented Left is
              going to be able to cut the hysterical weeping long enough to realize:
              <em>You’re going to have to put your social ideals into Neocameral format
                if you want to play in the 21st century</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              They really could do that. Sovereign stock distribution could be wholly
              egalitarian. If Neo-Maoism seeks a sensible sized patch, they should
              clearly be given one. (That would be a Neo-Maoist garbage disposal
              program, as far as everyone else is concerned.) At the highest
              <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/meta-neocameralism/">level</a>, NRx
              is first-order politics neutral. Do <em>whatever you want</em>, within
              precisely formalized bounds.

            <p>There’s no audience for this point yet. Eventually there will be.</p>

              “But … but .. the whole point of the Left is that we don’t think
              government is a business!” — Then call it a ‘co-op’ or some equivalent
              bullshit. Jesus, use some imagination.

              <em>At the core of all of this is finding ways to earn non-yen
                denominated revenue. Currency diversification to prepare for a
                domestic shock. They are preparing for the devaluing of the yen, and
                they expect it to happen to the yen first and the dollar later. Many
                have bet against the yen and lost, including recently Kyle Bass, but
                if the Japanese themselves are starting to bail, the end must be
                approaching. It is an interesting island culture shaping up. Greying
                and shrinking population, growing robotics industry, worlds’ largest
                creditor nation with trillions in net assets, “xenophobic” immigration
                policy, shrinking working population… it is like they are setting up

            <p>
              If this analysis is correct, it suggests that Japanese capital is set to
              become a major resource for world-wide trends with an NRx (anti-demotic
              propertarian) orientation. Sustaining foreign investment revenue streams
              will become an existential necessity for a grayed Japan, which is enough
              to establish a definite agenda regarding governance models in the
              functional fragments of the world system.

            </p>
            <p>
              <em>The most intriguing secrets of the “war on terror” have nothing to do
                with al-Qaeda and its fellow travelers. They’re about the mammoth
                private spying industry that all but runs U.S. intelligence operations
                today. […] Surprised? No wonder. In April, Director of National
                Intelligence Mike McConnell was poised to publicize a year-long
                examination of outsourcing by U.S. intelligence agencies. But the
                report was inexplicably delayed — and suddenly classified a national
                secret. What McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that the private
                spy industry has succeeded where no foreign government has: It has
                penetrated the CIA and is running the show. […] Over the past five
                years (some say almost a decade), there has been a revolution in the
                intelligence community toward wide-scale outsourcing. Private
                companies now perform key intelligence-agency functions, to the tune,
                I’m told, of more than $42 billion a year. Intelligence professionals
                tell me that more than 50 percent of the National Clandestine Service
                (NCS) — the heart, brains and soul of the CIA — has been outsourced to
                private firms such as Abraxas, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin
                and Raytheon. …</em>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, read it all, but especially:</p>
            <p>
              <em>Outsourcing has provided solutions to personnel-management problems
                that have always plagued the CIA’s operations side. Rather than tying
                agents up in the kind of office politics that government employees
                have to engage in to advance their careers, outsourcing permits them
                to focus on what they do best, which boosts morale and
                performance.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the conditions of a ruined public sphere, trends to the
              commercialization of government are re-routed around the back. When the
              time is right for the dismantling of the terminally deteriorated
              Cathedral Empire — a.k.a. ‘the International Community’ — its power
              structures will default to the Deep State, which is already undergoing
              business re-organization. Identify the private agencies who at that
              point will <em>own</em> the only chunks of security apparatus still
              working, and you know who’s political ideas will matter. It follows,
              naturally, that it would be unrealistic to expect these
              <em>directors</em> to be voluble about their thinking, or anything else.
              They’re not politicians. That’s over.
            </p>
            <p>
              The public sphere is already dead. It’s time now to shift all serious
              attention into the dark.

              Never underestimate the capacity of modern history’s neo-cyberpunk
              oddity to reach the place you thought you were heading ahead of time,
              and in a way that doesn’t seem … quite right. Glenn Beck has set his
              <em>heart</em> (and checkbook) on a version of neoreactionary
              secessionism, based on a restoration of the House of Disney. Once you
              see the
              <a

              it’s immediately obvious that nothing in the reactosphere will ever
              be the same again:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>While Independence is very much a dream at this point, the proposed
                city-theme park hybrid would bring several of Glenn’s seemingly
                disconnected projects into one place. Media, live events, small
                business stores, educational projects, charity, entertainment, news,
                information, and technology R&amp;D – all of these things would have a
                home in Independence. With the rest of the country and the world going
                away from the values of freedom, responsibility and truth,
                Independence would be a place built on the very foundation of those
                principles. A retreat from the world where entrepreneurs, artists, and
                creators could come to put their ideas to work. A place for families
                to bring their children to be inspired. […] The ambitious project,
                projected to cost over two billion dollars,
                <a
                  href="http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/01/07/did-you-know-walt-disney-had-a-company-dedicated-to-innovation-and-new-technology/">has
                  been heavily influenced by Walt Disney</a>. As Glenn has been explaining throughout the week,
                Disneyland
                was
                originally intended to be a place where people would find happiness,
                inspiration, courage and hope. Over time, Walt Disney’s original
                vision has been lost. While hundreds of thousands still flock to the
                town, it’s become commercialized and the big dreams and the heart have
                been compromised. […] Glenn believes that he can bring the heart and
                the spirit of Walt’s early Disneyland ideas into reality.
                Independence, USA wouldn’t be about rides and merchandise, but would
                be about community and freedom. The Marketplace would be a place where
                craftmen and artisan could open and run real small businesses and
                stores. The owners and tradesmen could hold apprenticeships and teach
                young people the skills and entrepreneurial spirit that has been lost
                in today’s entitlement state. […] There would also be an Media Center,
                where Glenn’s production company would film television, movies,
                documentaries, and more. Glenn hoped to include scripted television
                that would challenge viewers without resorting to a loss of human
                decency. He also said it would be a place where aspiring journalists
                would learn how to be great reporters. […] Across the lake, there
                would be a church modelled after The Alamo which would act as a
                multi-denominational mission center. The town will also have a working
                ranch where visitors can learn how to farm and work the land.</em>

            <h4 class="post-title">Triumph of the Will?</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            If it were never necessary to adapt fundamentally to reality, then
            fascism would be the truth. There could be no limit to the sovereignty
            of political will.
          </p>
          <p>
            If — pursuing this thought further into vile absurdity — even tactical
            concessions were unnecessary, then nothing would obstruct a path of
            joyous degeneration leading all the way to consummate communism. That,
            however, is several steps beyond anything that has been
            <em>seriously</em> advocated for over half a century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the 1920s, communism has been the ideal form of socio-economic
            impracticality, as evidenced by that fact that whenever communism
            becomes practical, it becomes — to exactly the same extent — fascist
            (‘state capitalist’ or ‘Stalinist’). Fascism on the other hand, and as
            everyone knows, makes the trains run on time. It represents
            <em>practical subordination of reality to concentrated will</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-222"></span><br />
            Fascism understands itself as the politics of the ‘third position’ —
            between the anti-political hyper-realism of the market on the one
            (invisible) hand, and super-political communist fantasy on the
            (clenched-fist) other. The fascism that thrives — most exceptionally in
            the American tradition through Hamilton, Lincoln, and FDR — is a
            flexi-fascism, or pragmatic illiberalism, that marries the populist
            desires of coercive collectivism to a superceded, subordinated, or
            directed ‘realism’ — grasping economic dispersion as
            <em>a technocratic management problem</em> under centralized
            supervision. Insofar as this problem proves to be indeed manageable, the
            basic fascist intuition is vindicated. Fragmentation is mastered, in a
            triumph of the will (although we are more likely to call it ‘hope and
            change’ today).
          </p>
          <p>
            That <em>fragmentation cannot be mastered</em> is the sole essentially
            anti-fascist proposition, and also the distinctive thesis of Austrian
            economics. Whilst deductively obtainable, within the axiomatic system of
            methodological individualism, it is a thesis that must ultimately be
            considered empirically sensitive. Fascism can discredit individualist
            assumptions simply by prolonging itself, and thus practically asserting
            the superior authority of the social super-organism. Reciprocally, the
            fragility of collective identities can only be convincingly demonstrated
            through historical events. It does not suffice to analytically
            ‘disprove’ the collective — it has to be effectively <em>broken</em>.
            Nothing less than a <em>totally unmanageable</em> economic crisis can
            really count against the fascist idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, obviously and disturbingly, the predictable political response to a
            gathering crisis is to

            <a href="http://www.niallferguson.com/journalism/politics/europes-new-fascists1">fascism</a>. Since fascism,
            beyond all brand-complexity, sells itself as ultimate
            managerial authority — heroic dragon-slayer of the autonomous (or
            ‘out-of-control’) economy — there is absolutely no reason for this to
            surprise us. To break fascism is to break the desire for fascism, which
            is to break the democratic or ‘popular will’ itself — and only a really
            freed economy, which has uncaged itself, spikily and irreversibly, can
            do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shattering of human collective self-management from the Outside, or
            (alternatively) triumphal fascism forever. That is the fork, dividing
            reaction from itself, and deciding everything for mankind. Patchwork or
            New Order — but when will we know?

            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/coming-attractions/">this</a>
            comments thread is Vladimir’s indispensable contribution to the schedule
            of decision: “Meanwhile, the Austro-libertarian prophets of doom are
            necessarily unable to give any accurate timing for these crashes and
            panics, even when they unfold exactly according to their theory. The
            reason is simple: the obvious truth of the weak efficient markets
            hypothesis.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ADDED: Ex-Army on why
            <a href="http://ex-army.blogspot.tw/2013/03/communism-fascism.html">Communism ≠ Fascism</a>: “When you’re
            given
            a
            choice between living under a communist dictator
            or a fascist dictator, everything else being equal, take the fascist
            dictator. Interestingly, communists in general are safer under a fascist
            dictator than they are under a communist dictator.”

            has triggered a wave of discussion by emphatically re-stating the
            long-standing thesis:
          </p>
          <p><em>America is a communist country. </em></p>
          <p>
            The supporting argument is richly multi-threaded, and I won’t attempt to
            recapitulate it here. Its dominant flavor can be appreciated in these
            paragraphs:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When the story of the 20th century is told in its proper, reactionary
              light, international communism is anything but a grievance of which
              Americans may complain. Rather, it’s a crime for which we have yet to
              repent. Since America is a communist country, the original communist
              country, and the most powerful and important of communist countries,
              the crimes of communism are our crimes. You may not personally have
              supported these crimes. Did you oppose them in any way?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Whereas actually, codewords like “progressive,” “social justice,”
              “change,” etc, are shared across the Popular Front community for the
              entire 20th century. They are just as likely to be used by a Cheka
              cheerleader from the ’20s, as a Clinton voter from the ’90s.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1288"></span>‘Progressives’ aren’t called out on their
            all-but-overt communism for ‘reasons’ of tact, rooted in a complex
            structure of intimidation, which itself attests to comprehensive Left
            triumph. It’s rude to call a ruling communist a communist, and being
            rude can be highly deleterious to life prospects (it’s a communist
            thing, which everyone understands all too well).
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite all this, <em>Outside in</em> probably won’t be stepping up its
            counter-communist rhetoric in any obvious way, because there’s a
            criticism of the AIACC analysis that remains unanswered — and which
            Moldbug seems averse to recognizing.
            <em>Fascism is the highest stage of communism</em>. Already in the 1930s
            — which is to say with the New Deal — even small-c ‘communism’ had been
            clearly surpassed by a more advanced model of slaving the private
            economy to the state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, America is a communist country, in much the same way that it is a
            protestant, and puritan one. The ideological lineage of its governing
            establishment leads through communism, in exactly the way Moldbug
            describes. The evolution of this lineage, however, has long passed on
            into <em>politically incorporated pseudo-capitalism</em>. This is a fact
            which can only be obscured by excessive attention to preliminary — and
            now entirely extinct — political forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is absolutely nobody on the empowered Left seeking to dismantle
            the co-opted oligarchy in order to establish direct ‘public’
            administration of the American industrial base. In this respect America
            is no more communist than the Third Reich (and also no less). Central
            planning is restricted to the monetary commanding heights, with a
            pragmatic apparatus of regulatory coercion enforcing political
            conformity among private businesses. This arrangement is accepted as far
            more consistent with effective direction of society through Cathedral
            teleology, in which the accumulation of cultural power is acknowledged
            as the supreme goal. Furthermore, it enables government insiders and
            allies to be rewarded relatively openly, economizing on the
            administrative, political, and psychological costs of extensive
            subterfuge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding that fascism is an advanced communist ideology is at least
            as important as recognizing AIACC, with more significant consequences,
            on the ‘right’ as well as the Left. Progressives progress. Communism was
            just a stage they went through.

            the triumph of fascism (spot on):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>National socialist parties argued that business firms should be made
              subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep
              them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that
              the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits
              paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do. Those points
              were central to the program of the National Socialist German Workers
              Party from the time it got that name— it was founded as the German
              Workers Party, and got the rest of the moniker at the urging of a
              little man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache who became the party’s
              leader not long after its founding — and those were the policies that
              the same party enacted when it took power in Germany in 1933.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If those policies sound familiar, dear reader, they should. That’s
              the other reason why next to nobody outside of specialist historical
              works mentions national socialism by name: the Western nations that
              defeated national socialism in Germany promptly adopted its core
              economic policies, the main source of its mass appeal, to forestall
              any attempt to revive it in the postwar world.<br /> </em><br />
            (via @PuzzlePirate)
          </p>
          <p>ADDED: A point of clarification and a question:</p>
          <p>
            Fascism isn’t a problem because it triggers scary feelings about the
            Nazis. It’s a problem because it’s running the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Question: Is there anybody among the critics of this contention who
            seeks to defend fascism against sloppy criticism and ‘spin’ who doesn’t
            also want — at least partially — to defend elements of socialist
            governance?<br />
            The sample size of the commentary so far is too small to tell, but it’s
            looking as if the answer is ‘no’. If so, it would suggest that Hayek and
            even (*gasp*) Jonah Goldberg are right  in suggesting that the
            fundamental controversy is about
            <em>spontaneous social organization</em>, and not about any unambiguous
            argument of Left v. Right.

            <h4 class="post-title">Fascism</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            The whole of Robert O. Paxton’s <em>The Anatomy of Fascism</em> (2004)
            is available
            <a
              href="http://libcom.org/files/Robert%20O.%20Paxton-The%20Anatomy%20of%20Fascism%20%20-Knopf%20(2004).pdf">here</a>.
            In the final pages (p.218), following detailed historical analysis,
            it cautiously advances a cultural-political definition:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by
              obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or
              victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in
              which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working
              in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites,
              abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and
              without ethical or legal restraint goals of internal cleansing and
              external expansion</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the topic regularly re-surfaces, it seems worth recording Paxton’s
            formulation as a reference point, especially as its emphases differ
            significantly from those this blog (and its critics) have tended to
            stress. An important conclusion of Paxton’s study is that no purely
            ideological account of fascism is able to capture what is an essentially
            historical phenomenon, which is to say a <em>process</em>, rooted in the
            degeneration of democracy. (Wikipedia offers some
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Paxton">background</a> on
            his work.)

          CHAPTER TWO - NEOLIBERALISM: THE FASCISM THAT WON
        </h3>

            <h4 class="post-title">‘Neoliberalism’</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            It’s absolutely obvious that any engagement with the most prominent
            current
            <a
              href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/">version</a>
            of accelerationist thinking — or indeed with any left-dominated
            discussion today — is going to encounter the term ‘<a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>‘ as an omnipresent reference. Sheer
            irritability won’t serve as a
            response for long.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why irritation at all? Most immediately, because the reference of this
            term is a sprawling mess. It is employed ambiguously to describe an
            epoch, and an ideology. The evident duplicity of this lies in the tacit
            assumption that the ideology defines the epoch — a vast historical and
            political claim, as well as an implausible one — which evades systematic
            interrogation through terminological sleaziness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-273"></span>Worse still, the characteristics of the
            ‘neoliberal’ ideology are themselves pasted together, primarily by a
            mish-mash of theoretically-impoverished anti-capitalist polemics from
            around the world, with the consequence that its only consistent feature
            is the mere fact of having a leftist opposition (somewhere). As the
            <em>Wikipedia</em> explanation (linked above) makes clear, any economic
            policy anywhere that is not positively hostile to the market, and which
            finds itself talked about antagonistically by the left, is ‘neoliberal’.
          </p>
          <p>
            When all of these compounding fuzz factors are taken into consideration,
            it is easy to see why the meaning of ‘neoliberal’ can range — at the
            very least — from marginally market-reformist Keynesianism (Clinton),
            through autocratic capitalism (Pinochet), to extreme libertarian
            ‘hyper-capitalism’ (in our dreams). Its global application, to include —
            for instance — the ethnic-Chinese dominated Pacific Rim (and post
            Reform-and-Opening Mainland China), is more carelessly gestural still.
            If Lenin’s 1921 New Economic Policy wasn’t ‘neoliberal’ it’s hard to see
            why — unless the absence of a left opposition suffices as an
            explanation. A word this sloppy — traditionally rooted in Latin American
            anti-market demagoguery, but since adopted generally as the linguistic
            equivalent of a Che Guevara T-shirt — has no serious analytical use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fashion is unpredictable, but it seems very unlikely that this word is
            going anywhere. Its totemic meaning within tribal leftism is enough to
            ensure its persistence — which is to say that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWPL">SWPL</a> radical chic
            signalling would be significantly inconvenienced without it. Might it
            then be possible to rigorize it?
          </p>
          <p>
            That would require delimitation, which is to say: specificity. Given the
            political utility of the word, there are few grounds for optimism in
            this respect. David Harvey, for instance, who has devoted a
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Neoliberalism-David-Harvey/dp/0199283273">book</a>
            to the ‘topic’ (<em>A Brief History of Neoliberalism</em>, 2005),
            produces no clear definition beyond resurgent capitalism, as it occurred
            with the partial recession of central planning from the late 1970s.
            Unsurprisingly, therefore, the more classically liberal policy becomes,
            the more ‘neoliberal’ it is too. The ‘neo-‘, in the end, signifies no
            more than an infuriated “you’re supposed to be dead, goddammit.”
            Neoliberalism is then a capitalistic orientation that has outlived
            expectation, and since the expectation has been sunk into immovable
            foundations, it is the outliving that requires explicit designation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever slight (and strictly polemical) coherence might be drawn from
            Harvey is thrown back into chaos by Benjamin Noys’
            <a href="http://www.academia.edu/327085/The_Grammar_of_Neoliberalism">paper</a>
            ‘The Grammar of Neoliberalism’ (2010). Far from describing the partial
            reversion to market-oriented economic arrangements in the wake of
            hegemonic Social Democratic assumptions, Noys identifies ‘neoliberalism’
            with the state-supervised capitalism introduced in the 1920s-30s, i.e.
            exactly that economic order which Harvey’s ‘neoliberalism’ overthrows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taken in its own terms — rather than as a defense of an intrinsically
            misleading word — Noys’ argument is highly interesting. Its general
            direction is captured in the following passage [citation marks
            subtracted]:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What is the precise nature, then, of neo-liberalism? Of course, the
              obvious objection to the ‘anti-state’ vision of neo-liberalism is that
              neo-liberalism itself is a continual form of state intervention,
              usually summarised in the phrase ‘socialism for the rich, capitalism
              for the poor’. Foucault notes that neo-liberalism concedes this:
              ‘neo-liberal government intervention is no less dense, frequent,
              active, and continuous than in any other system.’ The difference,
              however, is the <strong>point</strong> of application. It intervenes
              on society ‘so that competitive mechanisms can play a regulatory role
              at every moment and every point in society and by intervening in this
              way its objective will become possible, that is to say, a general
              regulation of society by the market.’ Therefore, we miss the point if
              we simply leave a critique of neo-liberalism at the point of saying
              ‘neo-liberalism is as statist as other governmental forms’. Instead,
              the necessity is to analyse how neo-liberalism creates a new form of
              governmentality in which the state performs a different function:
              permeating society to subject it to the economic.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting aside the question of this argument’s persuasiveness (for
            another time), the essential thing to note is that it represents a
            <em>contest</em> over the mindlessly shambling term ‘neoliberalism’
            which Noys has little realistic chance of winning — ‘winning’, that is,
            with sufficient comprehensiveness to salvage the word. If
            ‘neoliberalism’ <em>generally</em> meant a highly statist variant of
            ‘capitalist’ organization, first originating in the era of
            high-modernism, in which — in contrast to the statism of the left — the
            role of the state was specifically directed to imposing an
            administrative simulacrum of catallactic social order, it would become a
            valuable, theoretically-functional word. This would be so even if the
            theory itself were criticized, amended, or rejected — and in fact the
            very possibility of such engagement presupposes that ‘neoliberalism’
            becomes a <em>locally intelligible concept</em> (local, that is, to
            Noys’ argument and whatever halo it has managed to extend beyond
            itself).
          </p>
          <p>
            Even here on the Outer Right, almost all terminological irritability
            would immediately subside if the expression repeatedly encountered was —
            even implicitly — <em>Neoliberalism in the Noysean sense</em>. It would
            then be a term with relatively precise limits, clarifying more than it
            obscured. Consequently, it would mark a limit on the right as well as
            the left, distinguishing anti-statist or
            <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism — with its model in Hong Kong — from
            the dominant political-economic formation of our age. For that reason
            alone, it can be confidently anticipated that ‘neoliberalism’ will not
            be permitted to mean any such thing.

          </a>
          <p>
            Calling somebody a <em>fascist</em> tends to be a great way to end a
            conversation. First on the Left, and more recently on the Right, the
            abuse value of this term has been eagerly seized upon. Insofar as such
            usage merits the attribution of a ‘logic’ it is that of
            <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> — an argument or position that can be
            identified as fascist by implication is <em>thereby</em> immediately
            dismissed. Fascism is analyzed only as far as required to stick the
            label on the other guy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the reasons to regret this situation is the veil it casts over the
            triumph of fascism as the decisive historical fact of the 20th century.
            While the defeat of the core ‘fascist’ axis in the Second World War left
            the ideology bereft of confident defenders, reducing it to its merely
            abusive meaning, it also fostered the illusion that the victorious
            powers were essentially ‘anti-fascist’ — to the point of extreme
            military exertion. The historical reality, in contrast, is described far
            more accurately by dramatic convergence upon fascist ideas, from both
            Left and Right, as exemplified by the ascendency of pragmatic
            nationalism over radical collectivism in the communist world, and by
            social-democratic state-managerialism over
            <em>laissez-faire</em> ‘classical liberalism’ in the West. With calm
            discussion of this ‘third-position’ formation rendered next to
            impossible, the crucial attempt to understand its socio-historical
            specificity is diverted into sterile polemics.

            of blog posts on the historical reality of fascism. Rather than attack
            fascism (from the Left) for its residual capitalism, or (from the Right)
            for its innovative anti-capitalism, Greer prioritizes the philosophical
            task of a rectification of words:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              When George Orwell wrote his tremendous satire on totalitarian
              politics, <strong>1984</strong>, one of the core themes he explored
              was the debasement of language for political advantage. That habit
              found its lasting emblem in Orwell’s invented language Newspeak, which
              was deliberately designed to get in the way of clear thinking.
              Newspeak remains fictional—well, more or less—but the entire subject
              of fascism, and indeed the word itself, has gotten tangled up in a net
              of debased language and incoherent thinking as extreme as anything
              Orwell put in his novel.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days, to be more precise, the word “fascism” mostly functions as
              what S.I. Hayakawa used to call a snarl word — a content-free verbal
              noise that expresses angry emotions and nothing else. … To get past
              such stupidities, it’s going to be necessary to take the time to rise
              up out of the swamp of Newspeak that surrounds the subject of fascism
              — to reconnect words with their meanings, and political movements with
              their historical contexts.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Greer’s discussion is so eloquent and penetrating that it would be
            redundant to repeat it here. It deserves the widest possible careful
            reading, and subsequent reflection. (<em>Urban Future</em> endorses the
            entire argument, with only the most marginal reservations on
            comparatively insignificant points.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of pointless repetition, a question. Given that history has
            conspired to make the word ‘fascism’ illegible, and has thus not only
            obscured the dominant trend in social organization worldwide, but also
            stripped away all effective antibodies to resurgent movements of
            classical fascist type, is there any realistic path to a restoration of
            political lucidity? Is the world doomed to persistent blindness about
            what it is, and what it might still more dismally become? If there are
            any grounds for encouragement in this regard, the evidence for them is
            thin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greer’s conclusion seems no less bleak. Approaching it, he comments:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The fascist movements of the 1920s and 1930s were … closely attuned to
              the hopes and fears of the masses, far more so than either the
              mainstream parties or the established radical groups of their
              respective countries. Unlike the imagined “fascism” of modern radical
              rhetoric, they were an alternative to business as usual, an
              alternative that positioned itself squarely in the abandoned center of
              the political discourse of their eras. … Antisemitism and overt
              militarism were socially acceptable in Germany between the wars; they
              aren’t socially acceptable in today’s United States, and so they won’t
              play a role in a neofascist movement of any importance in the American
              future. What will play such roles, of course, are the tropes and
              buzzwords that appeal to Americans today, and those may very well
              include the tropes and buzzwords that appeal most to you.

          </a>
          <p>
            John Michael Greer’s
            <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-fascism-that-won/">grasp</a> of the
            fascist phenomenon is much stronger than Samir Amin’s. As might be
            expected from a voice so unambiguously aligned with the Left, Amin is
            entirely indifferent to the essentially populist nature of fascism and
            its erosion of property rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Property has no meaning apart from free disposal, equivalent to an Exit
            option on a particular instantiation of wealth. Fascism’s statist
            subordination of the independent ‘plutocracy’ — realized through
            more-or-less severe restrictions on the free disposal of assets, both
            formal and informal — is therefore inconsistent with the protection of
            private property, which is rather eroded from its foundations. (Where
            communism expropriates, fascism — more efficiently — attenuates.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Amin is therefore
            <a href="http://monthlyreview.org/2014/09/01/the-return-of-fascism-in-contemporary-capitalism/">writing</a>
            from a position of structurally-unobservant Marxist dogma when he
            remarks of “fascist regimes” in general:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… they were all willing to manage the government and society in such
              a way as not to call the fundamental principles of capitalism into
              question, specifically private capitalist property, including that of
              modern monopoly capitalism. That is why I call these different forms
              of fascism particular ways of managing capitalism and not political
              forms that challenge the latter’s legitimacy, even if “capitalism” or
              “plutocracies” were subject to long diatribes in the rhetoric of
              fascist speeches. The lie that hides the true nature of these speeches
              appears as soon as one examines the “alternative” proposed by these
              various forms of fascism, which are always silent concerning the main
              point — private capitalist property.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            On the contrary — every fascist regime qualifies the liberal right to
            free disposal of ‘strategic’ economic assets, and thus subverts “private
            capitalist property” at the root. Indeed, the forms of property most
            radically affected by fascist governance are precisely those
            identifiable with a capitalistic (i.e. productive) character. In the
            case of large-scale capital assets determined as the ‘commanding
            heights’ of a modern industrial economy, especially those of clear
            military significance, utilization is directed as stringently under
            fascist conditions as communistic ones (although typically with
            considerably greater administrative competence and pragmatic
            flexibility). When socialism emphasizes practicality, it tends to adopt
            fascistic traits — such as nationalism and state-supervised bourgeois
            management — automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-989"></span>Amin’s essay, however, is far from
            uninteresting. It’s most striking analysis, which also seems to have
            been its motivating topic, concerns political Islam. Amin’s disdain for
            this rising ideology is classically Marxist, and entirely untainted by
            New Left opportunism. In consequence, he is positioned as a voice in the
            wilderness, addressing a sympathetic audience that has been marginalized
            to the edge of disappearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After formulating a four-fold typology of fascist regimes, Amin
            resolutely folds Islamism into it, stating:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… the Western powers (the United States and its subaltern European
              allies) … have given preferential support to the Muslim Brotherhood
              and/or other “Salafist” organizations of political Islam. The reason
              for that is simple and obvious: these reactionary political forces
              accept exercising their power within globalized neoliberalism (and
              thus abandoning any prospect for social justice and national
              independence). That is the sole objective pursued by the imperialist
              powers.</em>
          </p>
          <em>
            <p>
              Consequently, political Islam’s program belongs to the type of fascism
              found in dependent societies. In fact, it shares with all forms of
              fascism two fundamental characteristics: (1) the absence of a
              challenge to the essential aspects of the capitalist order (and in
              this context this amounts to not challenging the model of lumpen
              development connected to the spread of globalized neoliberal
              capitalism); and (2) the choice of anti-democratic, police-state forms
              of political management (such as the prohibition of parties and
              organizations, and forced Islamization of morals).
            </p>
          </em>
          <p>
            <em>The anti-democratic option of the imperialist powers (which gives the
              lie to the pro-democratic rhetoric found in the flood of propaganda to
              which we are subjected), then, accepts the possible “excesses” of the
              Islamic regimes in question. Like other types of fascism and for the
              same reasons, these excesses are inscribed in the “genes” of their
              modes of thought: unquestioned submission to leaders, fanatic
              valorization of adherence to the state religion, and the formation of
              shock forces used to impose submission. In fact, and this can be seen
              already, the “Islamist” program makes progress only in the context of
              a civil war (between, among others, Sunnis and Shias) and results in
              nothing other than permanent chaos. This type of Islamist power is,
              then, the guarantee that the societies in question will remain
              absolutely incapable of asserting themselves on the world scene. It is
              clear that a declining United States has given up on getting something
              better — a stable and submissive local government — in favor of this
              “second best.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond an appeal for “vigilance”, Amin has little to propose in
            practical response to this predicament. Given the near-total evaporation
            of secular-leftist constituencies in the Muslim world, accompanied by
            the disappearance of a confident anti-Islamist Left outside it, this
            absence of practical direction is scarcely surprising.

            Since ‘fascism’ tweaks people’s Godwin nerves, it might be better to
            talk about ‘pragmatic populism’ — so long as it is initially understood
            that no substantial semantic revision is thereby taking place. Whatever
            we call it, it’s what has ruled the earth for close to a century, as the
            culmination of democracy, and the way classical liberalism is actually
            destroyed. It plays on basic human traits in a way that leaves every
            other ideology in the dust — tribalism, resentment, vicarious
            identification with authority, extreme susceptibility to simple
            propaganda, and all of the remaining highly-predictable, easily
            manipulable, aspects of hominid social emotion. Ultimately, it’s what
            humanity deserves, strictly speaking, since it is nothing other than the
            cynical exploitation of what people are like. The fact that the most
            insultingly trivial redecorations of this mode of social organization
            suffice to convince even articulate intellectuals that something else is
            taking place serves as an ample demonstration of its tidal historic
            momentum.

            The “national capitalist” is a concept that arises in the Marxian
            tradition, but has also (recently) acquired a very different valency
            elsewhere. Countries come to appear as estates.

            <h4 class="post-title">The ‘F’ Word</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Fascism is back, apparently. At the very least, it might be getting more interesting to talk about.</p>
          <p>In the period immediately following World War II, both of the triumphant blocs moved rapidly to define the
            word
            &lsquo;fascism&rsquo; expediently. The critical objective, on each side, was to emphasize those features
            comparatively understated in its own domestic version of the phenomenon, in order to underscore the
            impression
            that they had unambiguously sided against it. &lsquo;Fascism&rsquo; was, definitively, that thing recently
            and
            at an enormous cost defeated. The immense sacrifices &ndash; and, in fact, <em>progressive fascist
              reconstruction of society that had been accelerated during the war years</em> &ndash; was justified by the
            crushing defeat of an absolute evil. Distinction was imperative. Thus, the Soviets drew particular attention
            to
            the comparatively muted anti-capitalism of the Axis powers, while the Atlantic allies concentrated upon the
            exotic trappings of German anti-semitic Aryanism. It is particularly notable that the predominant Western
            definition of fascism is remarkably maladapted to even the most basic comprehension of the Italian original,
            and
            that both Western and Soviet anti-fascist narratives are compelled to downplay the revolutionary socialism
            of
            its roots, in both its Italian and its German variants.</p>
          <p>This is all understandable enough, but it grotesquely mystifies the reality of fascism, which was
            epitomized
            &ndash; universally &ndash; by the 20<sup>th</sup>-century war economy. Every major contestant of WWII
            &ndash;
            including the great Asian powers Japan and China &ndash; developed fascist governance to an advanced state.
            The
            essential feature was state seizure of the economy&rsquo;s &lsquo;commanding heights&rsquo; in the delegated
            (and integrated) &lsquo;popular interest&rsquo;. During war time such <em>interest</em> is peeled back to
            sheer
            survival, and thus publicized with dramatic intensity, which is also to say with an unusual absence of
            skepticism. Fascism is therefore broadly identical with <em>a normalization of war-powers</em> in a modern
            state, that is: <em>sustained social mobilization under central direction</em>. Consequently, it involves,
            beside the centralization of political authority in a permanent war council, a tribal hystericization of
            social
            identity, and a considerable measure of economic pragmatism. Fascism is <em>practical</em> socialism,
            distinguished from its dim cousin by its far more sophisticated grasp of incentives, or of human nature in
            its
            motivated individual and tribal particularity. When compared to universalistic communism, fascism&rsquo;s
            practical advantages are such that &lsquo;actually existing socialism&rsquo; <em>always</em> soon turns into
            it.
            <em>National socialism</em> and <em>socialism in one country</em> are not sanely separable things. Everyone
            knows that the literal meaning of &lsquo;fascism&rsquo; is <em>bundling</em>.</p>
          <p>Like its Continental European and Soviet competitors, American fascism had been fully consolidated by the
            beginning of the war. The New Deal cemented its structural pillars into place. Socialization of the economy
            through central banking, the transformation of the Supreme Court into a facilitator of systematic executive
            over-reach, and a transformation of mass-politics through broadcast media technologies had composed a new,
            post-constitutional political order. It is this formation that is so flagrantly entering its phase of
            terminal
            dementia today.</p>
          <p>Since the fascist state justifies itself through perpetual war, it naturally likes wars that cannot end.
            The
            Cold War looked like one, but wasn&rsquo;t quite. The War on Terror is a better bet. In regards to their
            interminability, if not their moral intensity, &lsquo;wars&rsquo; on poverty, drugs, and other resilient
            social
            conditions are more attractive still. Waging modern wars, and their metaphorical side-products, is what the
            fascist state is for. Winning them on occasion, and by accident, is only ever a misfortune. That lesson
            seems
            to
            have been thoroughly learned.</p>
          <p>The recent adaptation to television of Philip K. Dick&rsquo;s prophetic <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>
            is
            one suggestive indication of a general ideological awakening. In dramatic contrast to the prevailing
            historical
            myth, <em>fascism won WWII</em> so decisively that its opponents were driven to the political fringes of
            paleo-conservatism (once mainstream conservatism), libertarianism (once mainstream liberalism), and
            Trotskyism
            (once simply &lsquo;communism&rsquo;). The victory was so complete that even policy objectives as blatantly
            fascistic as <em>nationalization</em> could be considered wholly innocent of fascist taint. It wasn&rsquo;t
            even
            necessary to say: &ldquo;Nationalization, but, you know, not in a fascist way.&rdquo; It would be amusing if
            it
            hadn&rsquo;t ruined everything. Perhaps it still is amusing. It&rsquorsquo;s notable that humor has become
            quite
            a lot rougher recently.</p>
          <p>Since fascism had entirely filled the Overton Window, it lost contour, and became invisible. The word
            persisted
            in public conversation only as an empty slur. Under this cover, and the absurdly misleading branding
            associated
            with it, American fascism ascended to a state of global hegemonic dominance. Since 1989, it has been
            essentially
            unchallenged, except by the geopolitical temper-tantrum that is radical Islam. Yet suddenly, from left
            field,
            the Trump candidacy has thrown it into crisis.</p>
          <p>The flamboyant fascist features of the Trump campaign &ndash; and still more of his excited Alt-Right
            supporters &ndash; are deniable only by fools. The prior escalation of overt fascist imagery by the first
            Obama
            campaign and subsequent administration was no less remarkable. The established convention in polite society
            that
            <em>all conservative presidential candidates are Hitler</em> obscured the trend before this year, on both
            sides.
            Much of this might be reminiscent of the Jonah Goldberg thesis that <em>we are all fascists now</em>, which
            was
            near-universally dismissed out of hand, for reasons that have been &ndash; until recently &ndash; under no
            socio-political pressure whatsoever to defend themselves. <em>It&rsquo;s obvious nonsense</em>, the
            mind-control
            class had decided, and that should have been enough for everyone. Those days are unmistakably ending.</p>
          <p>The general insight that remains incompletely crystallized is this: <em>Democracy tends to fascism</em>,
            due
            to
            its fundamental affinity with tribal mobilization (i.e. its essential illiberalism). The multi-century
            ratchet
            of Western democratization has led, exactly, and inexorably, <em>to this</em>. If the worst hasn&rsquo;t
            come
            yet, it will come soon. We are all close to seeing that now.</p>
          <p>An especially obvious catalyst for political radicalization has been the embrace of demographic engineering
            as
            an explicit policy objective, of deliberate partisan asymmetry, attended by a rolling thunder of
            cultural-elite
            approved rhetoric that has not only been indiscreet, but blatantly triumphalistic. When dismissing fears of
            &lsquo;white genocide&rsquo; as malignant, and over-wrought, it is not helpful to laugh in public about the
            steady progress of population replacement (in the fashion of John Judis and Ruy Teixeira, most obviously).
            At
            some point, Bertholt Brecht&rsquo;s most celebrated example of devil&rsquo;s advocacy &ndash; &ldquo;Would
            it
            not be easier &hellip; for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?&rdquo; &ndash; switched
            ideological polarity, to become a bitter Alt-Right joke. <em>The new American demography is really going to
              screw you guys over</em> is funny as hell, until &ndash; suddenly &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
          <p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of laughter in 2016, but not much smiling. Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be so long
            before
            people realize what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>

          <p>
            Within the great spans of history, domestic ideological controversy is
            something close to a luxury good. Whenever it isn’t to same extent ‘on
            hold’ the global environment is untypically benign. Under more normal —
            which is to say <em>stressed</em> — conditions, it either folds down
            into pragmatism, or explodes into cosmic, eschatological drama. In
            today’s unmistakably stressed world, Alexander
            <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/war-without-end/">Dugin</a>‘s ‘<a
              href="http://www.4pt.su/en/topics/eurasianism">Eurasianism</a>‘ exemplifies the latter eventuality.

            As with Jacobinism and Bolshevism before it, Eurasianism matters to you
            whether you want it to or not. The grandeur of its scope is undeniable.
            It is concerned with nothing less than the fate of the the earth. In
            this sense, nothing that anyone cares about falls outside it. (People
            are beginning to get

          </p>
          <p>
            Shelving moral and partisan responses, it is merely realistic to
            acknowledge that Dugin is an ideological genius of the first order.

            as the optimal context for the exercise of strategic intelligence can
            scarcely fail to find encouragement in this complex
            <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c03s03.html">pattern</a>
            of widening fractures. In comparison to the cramped and dangerous
            position of a world geostrategic challenger, that of a triangular
            balancer presents advantages that are difficult to over-estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            China cannot plausibly be described as an ‘Atlantean’ power (despite the
            great historical importance of its ‘<a
              href="http://www.hiebs.hku.hk/working_paper_updates/pdf/wp1071b.pdf">Singlosphere</a>‘). Yet, neither is
            it
            ‘Hyperborean’ in any persuasive sense. These
            options both belong to a dirempted Occident — understood according to an
            expansive, rather than Eurasian definition, attentive to common
            classical and Christian roots. The Eurasian mythos is not inherently
            Sino-sensitive. China’s moves will be made upon a still greater gaming
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both a (geographically) Eurasian and a Pacific-maritime power — already,
            perhaps, a super-power — China has free options within the conflicted
            global space that Dugin’s ideology so convincingly, or at least
            compellingly, portrays. The next stage of Chinese geopolitical evolution
            will occur within an environment of dynamic, triangular tensions. The
            course of the world depends upon how this opportunity is played.

            There’s a sizable constituency on the ‘alt right’ whose self-understood
            differentiation from the Marxist left is entirely reducible to its own
            heightened appreciation for authoritarian hierarchy and racial
            solidarity. Since actually existing Marxist-Leninist regimes have been,
            uniformly, authoritarian-hierarchical ethno-nationalists, this isn’t in
            fact the basis for any real difference at all.

            Topic of the week, it seems. XS will carve out a Chaos Patch space for
            targeted links on Sunday, but for impatient types, here’s a taster (<a

          </p>
          <p>
            This blog, I’m guessing predictably, takes
            <em>a count me out</em> position. Neoreaction, as I understand it,
            predicted the emergence of the Alt-Right as an inevitable outcome of
            Cathedral over-reach, and didn’t remotely like what it saw. Kick a dog
            enough and you end up with a bad-tempered dog. Acknowledging the fact
            doesn’t mean you support kicking dogs — or bad-tempered dogs. Maybe
            you’d be happy to see the dog-kicker get bitten (me too). That, however,
            is as far as it goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short definition, that seems to me uncontroversial:
            <em>The Alt-Right is the populist dissident right</em>. Set
            theoretically, NRx is therefore grouped with it, but as a quite
            different thing. Another obvious conclusion from the definition: the
            Alt-Right is almost inevitably going to be far larger than NRx is, or
            should ever aim to be. If you think people power is basically great, but
            the Left have just been doing it wrong, the Alt-Right is most probably
            what you’re looking for (and NRx definitely isn’t).
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Alt-Right, generally speaking, fascism is (1) basically a great
            idea, and (2) a meaningless slur concocted by (((Cultural Marxists))) to
            be laughed at. For NRx (XS version) fascism is a late-stage leftist
            aberration made peculiarly toxic by its comparative practicality.
            There’s no real room for a meeting of minds on this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a consequence of its essential populism, the Alt-Right is inclined to
            anti-capitalism, ethno-socialism, grievance politics, and progressive
            statism. Its interest in geopolitical fragmentation (or Patchwork
            production) is somewhere between hopelessly distracted and positively
            hostile. Beside its — admittedly highly entertaining — potential for
            collapse catalysis, there’s no reason at all for the techno-commercial
            wing of NRx to have the slightest sympathy for it. Space for tactical
            cooperation, within the strategic framework of pan-secessionism,
            certainly exists, but that could equally be said of full-on Maoists with
            a willingness to break things up.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this should be taken as a competition for recruits. The
            Alt-Right will get almost all of them — it’s bound to be huge. From the
            NRx perspective, the Alt-Right is to be appreciated for helping to clean
            us up. They’re most welcome to take whoever they can, especially if they
            shut the door on the way out.

            There’s a Wikipedia
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">answer</a> to the
            question now. It doesn’t strike me as obviously dishonest, or any more
            inchoate than the phenomenon itself. Building Trump-adoration into the
            definition will ensure that it dates fast — but it’s not hard to see why
            that seems necessary.

            There’s a lot of <em>Wikipedia</em> disdain around, in our neck of the
            woods, but I’m usually hard-pressed to find serious cause for complaint.
            After taking a look at RationalWIki — which
            <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alt-right#Alt-right">folds</a> the
            Alt-Right into its “Neoreactionary movement” rant presently — returning

            It might stagger on for a bit longer, but it has nothing left to do.
            Annoying the (impending) Trump Regime at this point would be pointless,
            so that prospect isn’t any source of leverage. The 1488 nut cases, due
            to their marriage of convenience with the legacy media, have the ability
            to define it in the public mind, so those supporters without a
            Nazi-fetish will gradually drift away. It’s done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fascism isn’t cool, and Anglosphere cultures will never find it so. In
            Continental Europe it’s different, but that’s a whole other topic. We’re
            not them, which is one of the crucial things the Alt-Right ultras won’t
            ever get. We’re
            <a href="https://openrevolt.info/2013/02/03/alexander-dugin-the-great-war-of-continents/">Atlanteans</a>.
            There’s
            expanded space for a right-populist American nationalist
            movement, but it won’t call itself the Alt-Right, and if it’s remotely
            sensible it will be pre-emptively immunized against ruinous European
            ideas. It will probably be far more Tea-Party flavored, though a lot
            tougher. (This blog will still find its populism unappetizing.)

            what
            the comparatively honest faction of the Cathedral is
            seeing.
          </p>
          <p>Main XS-specific quibbles:</p>
          <p>
            (1) No, I didn’t have anything to do with The Dark Enlightenment
            <a href="http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/">blog</a>. Nor, I’m
            <em>highly</em> confident, did Curtis Yarvin. I’m especially
            confident that the Open Letter was not written as an introduction to the
            DE.<br />
            ADDED: See this TDE
            <a href="http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/2017/03/04/for-the-record/">statement</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) I have no social connections <em>at all</em> with the Lesser
            God-tier of SV. (If I did, I’d brag about it all the time.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) Anyone who thinks
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/what-is-the-alt-right/">this</a>
            usage of echoes is non-ironic needs a Kek-check.
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) The RamZPaul link is complete black-thread and duct tape
            conspiracism. (C’mon, seriously, that’s obvious, isn’t it?) A little
            reciprocal linkage isn’t a social relationship. We both merely
            acknowledge that the other guy exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Induction would suggest there are some other howlers beyond my
            epistemological horizon. Frankly, though, I don’t see much deliberate
            malevolence here. Cramer seems to be doing his best to understand what’s
            going on, and to remain as calm as possible about it. If he’s primarily
            interested in the Alt-Right, I’d recommend much more attention to
            Richard Spencer, and much less to Neoreaction. My recommendation to NRx,
            naturally, is to vindicate that suggestion.

            <em>I made the case just a couple months back that Republican
              presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is a sort of
              <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/574097/donald-trump-leading-protofascist-movement">fledgling
                Mussolini</a>,
              nurturing an incipient fascist movement. As the first primaries
              approach, and Trump’s lead in the polls is actually widening, his
              development toward outright fascism is progressing faster than I
              feared. […] As of August, Trump had most of the ingredients for a
              fascist movement: the victim complex, the fervent nationalism, the
              obsession with national purity and cleansing purges, and the cult of
              personality. He was missing the organized violence, a left-wing
              challenge strong enough to push traditional conservative elites into
              his camp, support for wars of aggression, and a full-bore attack on
              democracy itself. He’s made much progress on all but the last one.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The last one is the only point of NRx intersection, but if he takes The
            White House, there’s going to be plenty of deranged: “See, this is what
            the Dark Enlightenment leads to!” analysis (among the upper echelons of
            the leftist commentariat). No, this is what democracy leads to. It’s
            called <em>radical populism</em>. (Unfortunately, that’s a message that
            isn’t going to be heard.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The Left would rather hand lurid fascism the keys than stop what they’re
            doing (they’re already doing the non-lurid
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">version</a>). That would count as a perverse
            moral
            vindication — cooking up the
            enemy they always said they wanted to stop. Eventually, they’ll manage
            it. The Ancients already knew that’s how this thing ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            It goes without saying that NRx should back away as far as possible,
            while scattering signs of protection (not that it will do any good).

            the gruesome picture almost perfectly. (Read the whole thing — it’s not
            long.)
          </p>
          <p>
            In the course of a few months, Angela Merkel was transmogrified from a
            moderately talented German politician, into one of the most destructive
            leaders in world history. If that sounds like an exaggeration, it’s only
            because her responsibility for dragging the European continent back into
            a new 1930s still awaits the unfolding of events. Even without complete
            <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2015/11/14/a-letter-to-france/">relapse</a>
            into a dark age of authoritarian anti-capitalism, the wave of rape,
            pillage, and terror she has unleashed will now — inevitably — devastate
            millions of lives, and structurally degrade the quality of life for tens
            of millions more as they seek to protect themselves in markedly more
            adverse social circumstances. It will all get extremely ugly. As Linker
            dryly remarks, “let’s just say it’s unlikely to end well. … And the
            storm has only just begun to gather.”

            What was she thinking? Assuming — as seems fair — that she doesn’t
            positively want to usher in Hitler 2.0, her catastrophic policy
            decisions have to be <em>misguided</em>. It’s probably no easier for the
            readers of this blog than it is for me to cognitively sympathize with
            the deranged path she has taken. One can only infer that she genuinely
            believed a vast flood of predominantly young, male, Islamic,
            tribalistic, and historically-traumatized incomers, with a hallucinatory
            sense of (unrealizable) cultural and material
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/08/05/professor-arabs-migrate-women/">entitlement</a>, would
            immediately transmute into fungible production units and
            contribute to European pensions financing. <em>The Economist</em>

              href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21699309-refugees-cannot-solve-europes-demographic-woes-not-so-fast">pretends</a>
            to believe the same thing. I’m forced to accept it’s possible to believe
            it, despite finding the flying spaghetti monster significantly more
            plausible. If this depth of delusion really has a grip on the minds of
            Western elites, any outcome other than utter disaster is most probably
            unobtainable. A cynical lie would be far less dangerous.

          <p>
            <em>To call Trumpism fascist is to suggest that it demands from us a
              unique response. We <strong>can</strong> deploy the “fascism” moniker
              to Trump’s ascendance by recognizing features like selective populism,
              nationalism, racism, traditionalism, the deployment of Newspeak and
              disregard for reasoned debate. The reason we
              <strong>should</strong> use the term is because, taken together, these
              aspects of Trumpism are not well combated or contained by standard
              liberal appeals to reason. It is constitutive of its fascism that it

            To prepare for an excursion into the real-world workings of strategic

            harshly illuminating conversation between David P. Goldman (‘Spengler’)
            and the ghost of Cardinal Richelieu is worth recalling:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“We are a bit confused about Syria,” I began. “Its leader, Bashar
              al-Assad, is slaughtering his own people to suppress an uprising. And
              he is allied to Iran, which wants to acquire nuclear weapons and
              dominate the region. If we overthrow Assad, Sunni radicals will
              replace him, and take revenge on the Syrian minorities. And a radical
              Sunni government in Syria would ally itself with the Sunni minority
              next door in Iraq and make civil war more likely.”</em>
          </p>
          <em>
            <p>“I don’t understand the question,” Richelieu replied.</p>
            <p>
              “Everyone is killing each other in Syria and some other places in the
              region, and the conflict might spread. What should we do about it?”
            </p>
            <p>“How much does this cost you?”</p>
            <p>“Nothing at all,” I answered.</p>
            <p>
              “Then let them kill each other as long as possible, which is to say
              for 30 years or so. Do you know,” the ghastly Cardinal continued, “why
              really interesting wars last for 30 years? That has been true from the
              Peloponnesian War to my own century. First you kill the fathers, then
              you kill their sons. There aren’t usually enough men left for a third
              iteration.”
            </p>

            <h4 class="post-title">Rough Triangles</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            The elementary model of robust plural order is the
            <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/reign-of-the-tripod/">tripod</a>.
            Whether taken as a schema for constitutional

            <a href="http://www.cfr.org/religion-and-politics/god-gold/p13990">cultural matrix</a>
            supporting decentralized societies, or a pattern of ultimate
            <a href="http://www.biroco.com/yijing/index.htm">cosmic equilibrium</a>,
            triangular fragmentation provides the archetype of quasi-stable
            disunity. By dynamically preempting the emergence of a dominant
            instance, the triangle describes an automatic power-suppression
            mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the
            <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms"><em>Romance of the Three
                Kingdoms</em></a>
            to
            <em><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</a></em>, triangular
            fragmentation
            has
            been seen to present an important and
            distinctive strategic quandary. In power balances of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff">Mexican Standoff</a>
            type, initiation of force is inhibited by the triangular structure, in
            which the third, <em>reserved</em> party profits from hostilities
            between the other two.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-238"></span>The Cold War, schematized to its basics, is
            the single most telling example. Rather than a binary conflict between
            East and West, the deep structure of the Cold War was triangular, making
            it intractable to two-player game-theoretic calculations. Catastrophic
            damage that might be rationally acceptable within a binary conflict, as
            the price for total elimination of one’s foe, becomes suicidal in a
            three-player game, where it ensures the victory of the third party.
            <a href="http://www.securityaffairs.org/issues/2006/10/payne.php">MAD</a>-reason is no longer readily
            applied,
            once ‘mutual’ is more than two.

            lose their way in the triangle, where the economy of sacrifice has to be
            radically reconsidered. Among the Cold War’s Three Kingdoms, it was the
            chess masters who ‘won’ the race to defeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lessons of the Cold War are no less relevant to its successor, which
            also fostered binary illusions in its early stages. America’s chess
            match with militant Islam resulted in a stalemate, at best.

            Sunni-Shia rivalry recasts the current war as a rough triangle, captured
            in its strategic essentials by the colloquialism
            <em>Let’s you and him fight</em>. This was Cardinal Richelieu’s way with
            triangles, as ‘Spengler’
            <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HL05Ak04.html">reminds us</a>:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The classic example is the great German civil war, namely the 30
              Years’ War of 1618-48. The Catholic and Protestant Germans, with
              roughly equal strength, battered each other through two generations
              because France sneakily shifted resources to whichever side seemed
              likely to fold. I have contended for years that the United States
              ultimately will adopt the perpetual-warfare doctrine that so well
              served Cardinal Richelieu and made France the master of Europe for a
              century (see

          </p>

            To imagine this policy being pursued with cold deliberation is the stuff

            rough triangles, but since it’s important to Ingemi, and Ingemi sees the
            pattern so clearly, we’ll do our best to remain sub-orgasmic about the
            situation (even if it escalates into a regional humanitarian calamity of

            considerably less demanding than Jesus in this regard, but
            it still tilts against indecorous exultation in mass slaughter. The view
            from the side-lines calls for detachment, and the side-lines are the
            center here.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a rough triangle, the side-lines are decidedly the place to be. That
            should be obvious, and if judged by the serial anecdotes of blog
            commentary, it is indeed self-evident to the widely-disparaged ‘proles’
            of the right — among whom “please let them kill each other” amounts to
            common wisdom. Adam Garfinkle, who doesn’t seem to approve, nevertheless
            <a

            a convincing political back-story to this state of mind. There’s a lack
            of “affinity”, a loss of media purchase (i.e. live video), and too many
            unhealed burns. Less than a quarter of Americans are

            what John McCain is selling (which shows that you can get almost a
            quarter of Americans to buy anything).

          <p>
            The Syrian quagmire models a rough triangle with such extraordinary
            exactness that it tempts us into Platonism. It could have been
            extracted, essentially unmodified, from the notebooks of Cardinal
            Richelieu. It’s not difficult to find these developments, as they unfold
            symmetrically in Syria and Iraq, provocatively weird. If a strategic
            genius had deliberately steered the ‘war on terror’ to this eventuality,
            his world-historic stature would have been guaranteed. It is worth
            recalling that when the Bush WoT went pear-shaped, John Derbyshire
            coined the phrase “to-hell-with-them hawks” to describe dissent from the
            right, in distinction from overseas state-building neoconservatism. To
            Hell they now go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improbable conspiracy aside, none of this was planned, and that’s where
            the most important lesson lies. The “to-hell-with-them hawks” had no
            strategy to send America’s enemies to hell, but only inchoate grumbles
            about the progressive welfarization of US military activity. For the
            harsh right, the message of the early 21st century was that American
            military power was no longer politically usable. It was time to clamber
            out of the sandbox, because the Cathedral had filled it with huggy
            dolls. Doing nothing was the only option left. (Fernandez,
            uncharacteristically, is embarrassingly
            <a href="http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/06/01/back-to-the-future-2/">slow</a>
            to grasp this point.)

          <p>
            In the field of right-populist international relations thinking,
            therefore, there is already broad — if only partially articulate —
            support for the neoreactionary stance, explored most lucidly by
            <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/the-progressive-reaction/">Foseti</a>, which might be
            characterized as <em>de-activism</em>. What we’re not
            on board for is the primary consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under Cathedralized conditions, suspension of the act can be the only
            way to let things happen. Just stop, and let ‘providence’ take over.
            Perhaps inaction will even simulate strategic genius. We’ve seen that it
            can.

            background is important, and relates the topic to a wider
            question of conservation laws.

            <em>The collapse in the Middle East feels like
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594037043/wwwfallbackbe-20">Black April, 1975</a>, the
              month
              South Vietnam fell [<a
                href="http://counterjihadreport.com/2014/10/14/5-key-implications-if-baghdad-falls-to-isis/">*</a>]. And
              it
              should, because just as the collapse of Saigon did not
              happen in Black April, but in a political American decision to allow
              South Vietnam to fall after a “decent interval”, so also is the
              ongoing collapse rooted, not in the recent tactical mistakes of the
              White House, but in the grand strategic decision president Obama made
              when he assumed office. […] This <strong>is the plan</strong>. It
              would be crazy not to acknowledge it.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            A humanitarian foreign policy is as much a hostage to dark humor as any
            other affront to Gnon. Hell doesn’t go away just because you don’t like
            it. So instead it slides diagonally in the only direction left open,
            from bloody (and incompetent) hegemonism into radically cynical
            catastrophe tweaking:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Deep in their hearts the Washington Post and the New York Times must
              realize they endorsed Obama precisely because they knew that when this
              moment came he would harden his heart and refuse to re-engage, except
              for show. Since this is the plan, the only effective strategy, the
              only sane thing to do is to accept the liberal gambit and continue it.
              […] The obvious continuation is not to dampen the sectarian conflict,
              but to exacerbate it to the greatest degree possible. America, like
              Britain in the Napoleonic age, should adopt the policy of supporting
              first one side then the other, or preferably both at once, so that the
              combatants inflict the maximum degree of damage on each other. […] …
              To a cynic, what follows next is quite simple: to be the winner stand
              back and watch while the Arabian peninsula, Levant and North Africa
              destroys itself. Take every opportunity to make it worse. Clearly a
              humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale will result. Hundreds
              of thousands are already dead and millions of displaced persons are on
              the road. That will only grow in scale and number to millions of dead
              and tens of millions of refugees. Therefore steps like preparing to
              sink the people smuggling boats, as the EU is doing, are in order. […]
              If you can stomach it, it can work like a charm. […] The main problem
              with this strategy is that Obama may not be able to contain its
              effects. …</em>

              struggle since 2001 and to be the most attractive option for people
              inclined to practice insurgency. Salafist Islam also melds well with
              the lessons in insurgency and terrorism previously taught by Marxist
              theoreticians such as Carlos Marighella, especially when one factors
              in the ideas and strategy of modern Islamist theorists such as Sayyid
              Qutb and Abu Bakr al Naji, author of

              radical left in the West, who may go so far as to be motivated by the
              melding of a theory of armed revolution with an intact religious
              tradition, thereby even converting to Islam. It may also mean that

            This process of amalgamation between the camps of the enemy is of the
            very greatest advantage to the Outer Right. The model of domestic
            progressive ‘evolution’ is switched to one of stark foreign aggression.
            It thus terminates all prospect of political compromise, and integrates
            a single military security problem.

            If the Right is incapable of recognizing what it is, it can at least
            consolidate against what it has to stop. It is in the ashes of this
            conflict that the toxic dream of political universality will have died.

            There’s a lot of conspiracy-theorizing underway right now, but it seems
            implausible, and superfluous. A spontaneous convergence of (perceived)
            interests is capable of explaining everything. In the end, though,
            someone is being played. In fact, it’s not only possible, but probable,
            that both sides of this particular arrangement are being played, and not
            primarily by each other.

            <em>In a series of interventions, Adil Ahmad Haque and Charlie Dunlap
              have debated the Defense Department
              <strong><a href="http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/images/law_war_manual15.pdf">Law of War Manual</a></strong>’s
              position

              <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/24233/human-shields-reply-charlie-dunlap/">here</a>). Claiming that
              the
              manual does not draw a distinction between
              voluntary and involuntary human shields, Haque maintains that it
              ignores the principle of proportionality, thus permitting the killing
              of defenseless civilians who are used as involuntary shields. Dunlap,
              however, insists that the manual includes all the necessary
              precautions for protecting civilians used as shields by enemy
              combatants, and argues that the adoption of Haque’s approach would
              actually encourage the enemy to increase the deployment of involuntary
              human shields. …</em>

          <p>
            Sensitivity to the plight of ‘human shields’ directly increases their
            tactical value. That is the ultimate ‘proportionality’ involved in the
            discussion. Disciplined attention to incentives under conditions of
            unbounded competition reliably heads into dark places.

            the core game theoretic model of economic crisis:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… deciding whether to invest in financial assets or any other form of
              capital can be viewed as a huge n-person game (one involving more than
              two participants), in which there are two options: trust in a good
              outcome, which will lead you to make the investment, or defect from
              the game and sit on your money. If you don’t have a firm idea about
              what is going to happen and the payoffs are extremely uncertain, the
              optimal strategy may well be to defect rather than to trust. And if
              everybody defects, bad things result</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does anybody seriously expect honesty from the
            <em>status quo</em> within this context? ‘Optimism’ is a fundamental
            building-block of regime stability. Expect it to be very carefully
            nurtured, with whatever epistemological flexibility is found helpful.

            (Gottlieb on) Hobbes, getting the critical point:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What was distinctive about Hobbes’s theory, and what led to his being
              attacked as a moral nihilist, was his refusal to appeal to any concern
              for the good of others or the collective good as a basis for moral
              motivation. He demonstrated that the familiar rules of morality, which
              he called the laws of nature, are principles of conduct such that if
              everyone follows them, everyone will be better off. But the fact that
              everyone will be better off if everyone follows them gives no
              individual a reason to follow them himself. He can have a reason to
              follow them only if that will make him individually better off. And
              there is no natural guarantee that individual self-interest and the
              collective interest will coincide in this way. […] Hobbes concluded
              that although we all have a reason to want to live in a community
              governed by the moral rules, we cannot achieve this unless we bring it
              about that it is in each person’s individual interest to abide by
              those rules. And the method of doing that is to agree with one another
              to support a powerful sovereign with a monopoly on the use of force,
              who will use it to punish violators. Only then can each individual be
              confident that if he obeys the rules, he will not be laying himself
              open to assault and dispossession by others. Without the trust
              engendered by the knowledge that violators will be punished,
              civilization is impossible and individual self-interest — the same
              rational motive that supports morality — leads to perpetual conflict
              and constant insecurity. This is the famous Hobbesian state of nature,
              and Hobbes was most notorious for saying that in this condition, we
              are almost never obligated to obey the moral rules, because it is not
              safe to do so.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The identification of a collective optimum does no
            <em>realistic</em> theoretical work. Irrespective of the status of his
            concrete conclusion, Hobbes’ methodical principle is impeccable.

          </a>
          <p>
            Terrorism is notoriously resistant to strict definition, and the most
            obvious reason for this is generally understood. Unlike (for instance)
            guerrilla warfare, ‘terrorism’ is not merely a tactic, but an
            intrinsically abominated tactic. Whatever the technical usage of the
            word, it adheres to the register of propaganda, as a partisan
            denunciation. It is what the other side does.
          </p>
          <p>
            This partisan skew is reinforced by technical considerations. Even more
            than guerrilla warfare, terrorism is a tactic suited to relatively
            disorganized non-state actors. When even guerrilla warfare is
            impractical, terrorism is the mode of violent ‘resistance’ that remains.
            In the sentimental language of the Left, it is the
            <em>warfare of the weak</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-378"></span><br />
            If these factors are recognized, a realistic definition of terrorism can
            be constructed that coldly acknowledges both aspects of its positioning,
            as an ideologically motivated atrocity without state legitimation.
            <em>Terrorism is violent partisan criminality</em>. It is aggressive
            violation of the law in the service of a political cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a
            <a href="http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/04/16/the-runaway-word/#more-28458">post</a>
            written prior to the identification of the Boston Marathon bombers,
            Richard Fernandez makes a point that is far from original, but all the
            more important for being clearly true, and widely accepted as being
            true:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The ascription of guilt in public attacks has become highly
              politicized. Each ideological side is rooting for its own set of
              villains to be identified as guilty. The Left desperately want the
              perpetrators to come [from] the Tea Party, White Supremacist Groups or
              at least Christians while the conservatives want the perps to be
              Muslims or drug addled lions of the Left.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Acts of terror taint a cause, its supporters, and its demographic base
            with <em>violent partisan criminality</em>. Who benefits? In the case of
            American domestic terrorism, at least, the answer is almost insultingly
            obvious. Those identified with <em>the target of terror</em> are
            strengthened by it, those pre-positioned as enemies of the terrorists
            even more so. After the atrocity occurs, the cry immediately arises:
            please let it not be <em>ours</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is distinctly <em>odd</em>. An act that is inherently political has
            a valency that directly and explicitly contradicts its superficial
            partisan motivation. Terrorism is not only something
            <em>the other side does</em>, it is something that — when reptilian
            partisan considerations are all that count — one
            <em>wants the other side to do</em>. How utterly delightful (if
            unavowable) to be blessed with spectacular public confirmation that
            one’s enemies are violent partisan criminals.
          </p>
          <p>
            An inevitable consequence of this oddity is the proliferation of
            <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/the-world-of-synthetic-manufactured-terrorism.html">conspiracy
              theories</a>.
            If the guiding question is <em>cui bono?</em>, the inescapable
            implication is that the target — ultimately, the State — is the only
            agent with a rational interest in terror taking place. ‘False flags’
            make much more sense than raw terror ever could. This way lies madness,
            and perhaps an ineluctable mass insanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alternative to conspiracy theory can only be common sense, but it
            finds itself surprisingly stressed. Is terror rationally explicable at
            all? Are its proponents simply deranged? Or do they perceive subtle
            advantage in sheer escalation — feeding their enemies, as a way to feed
            the war? With the world becoming ever more Black Swan-compatible, this
            is a story that has scarcely begun.

          </a>
          <p>
            Just in case there could be any doubt about it, the primary point of
            this post is to insist that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market">this</a> is
            a <em>really bad idea</em>. It’s certainly
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041009113523/http://jya.com/ap.htm">ingenious</a>, and
            <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.ca/2013/11/nyt-dallass-role-in-kennedys-murder.html">highly</a>

            but considered solely from a perspective of sub-reptilian amorality,
            it’s still a really bad idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            For one thing, it’s massively asymmetric, in the wrong way. Assassinate
            a McKinley, and it pushes things hard to the left. Assassinate a
            Kennedy, and it pushes things hard to the left. Assassinate pretty much
            anybody of any public significance, and the result is the same. Leftists
            are simply better at fantasy counter-factuals and martyrology, so the
            assassination of a leftist produces an imaginary ultra-leftist of even
            greater ideological purity (whilst killing a conservative works, or even
            turns them into a post-mortuary leftist). We all know that if JFK hadn’t
            been murdered by Texan capitalism we’d be basking in a socialist utopia
            by now. (There’s a reason why assassination is the preferred tactic of
            left-wing
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Czolgosz">anarchists</a> and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald">communists</a>,
            beside the fact these people are demented criminals.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The reciprocal is even more compelling. Anything that spares leftists
            from the consequences of participating in reality aids their cause. To
            consider only the most prominent potential target, Barack Obama alive
            and in power is the greatest single asset the Outer Right has ever
            known. Felled by an assassin, he would become the capstone of
            progressive mythology, and everything he’s aiming to achieve
            <em>would have turned out absolutely perfectly</em>. If there’s a black
            counter-assassination market, surreptitiously protecting key agents of
            the Cathedral from acts of violence, it would be infinitely more
            effective to invest in that.

            <h4 class="post-title">Chicken</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            When political
            <a href="http://today.duke.edu/2013/05/us-political-polarization-charted-new-study#video">polarization</a>
            is modeled as a game the result is Chicken. The technical basics are not
            very complicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reiterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (RPD) is socially integrative. An
            equilibrium, conforming to maximal aggregate utility, arises through
            reciprocal convergence upon an optimum strategy: defaulting to trust,
            punishing defections, and rapidly forgiving corrected behavior. Any
            society adopting these rule-of-thumb principles consolidates. When
            everyone norms on this strategy, individual and collective interests are
            harmonized. Things work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chicken is very different. Someone blinks first, so the trust-trust
            mutual optimum of RPD is subtracted in advance. Rather than the four
            possible outcomes of a single PD round (A and B do OK, A wins B loses, B
            wins A loses, A and B both lose) there are just three possible outcomes
            (A wins B loses, B wins A loses, A and B both lose extremely). In
            Chicken, it is the avoidance of outcome three, rather than the
            non-existent chance of PD outcome one, that moderates behavior, and then
            asymmetrically (someone always blinks first).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1419"></span>No less importantly, the time structure of
            Chicken is inverted. In RPD, the agents learn from successive decisions,
            and from their mere prospect. Each decision is punctual, Boolean, and
            communicatively isolated. In Chicken, the decision is mutual,
            quantitative, and anticipated by a strategically-dynamic introduction —
            an interactive process, in advance of the decision, that is richly
            communicative, complex, and even educational. In addition, when compared
            to PD, Chicken reiteration is remarkably complicated (more on that in a
            moment).
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the classic Chicken game. Two drivers accelerate towards each
            other, and the one who swerves (‘blinks’) loses. If neither swerves,
            both lose (worse). The lead up is everything, and the decision itself is
            a matter of speed and timing (a non-Boolean ‘when’ rather than a Boolean
            ‘which’). The question is not “will the other player defect?” but rather
            “how far will they go?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thomas
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling">Schelling</a>
            made an intellectual specialism out of Chicken, and his understanding of
            the classical version was sharpened by the concept of “credible
            commitment” (“how far will they go?”). How could a player ensure that
            his opponent does not win? The solution to this  problem, if produced in
            advance, has the strategic value of also maximizing the chance that the
            opponent blinks first (thus avoiding the pessimal lose-lose outcome, and
            generating a win).
          </p>
          <p>
            Producing credible commitment looks like this. Upon climbing into your
            car, conspicuously consume a bottle of vodka, thus communicating the
            fact that your ability to enact a successful last second swerve is very
            seriously impaired. Your opponent now knows that even were you inclined
            to avoid mutual destruction at the brink, you might not be able to do
            so. Then — once both cars have accelerated to a high speed — rip out
            your steering wheel and throw it out of the window. (It is extremely
            important that you do this before your opponent is able to — that’s what
            the vodka was for.) Your communicated commitment is now absolute. Your
            opponent alone can swerve. It’s death or glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘mainstream’ neoreactionary account of American political history is
            that of reiterated Chicken games between progressives and conservatives,
            in which <em>conservatives always swerve</em>. This analytical
            framework, despite its crudity, explains why conservatives consider
            their opponents to be intoxicated lunatics (i.e. winners) whilst they
            are sober and responsible (i.e. losers). As traditionally positioned,
            conservatives are the principal social stake-holders, and thus primarily
            obligated to avoid mutual destruction. It is <em>essential</em> to
            conservatism that it cannot take things (domestically) to the brink. Its
            incompetence at Chicken is thus constitutional.

            it can only be a sign that conservatism is coming to an
            <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115134/gop-death-watch-final-days-republican-party">end</a>. The
            Tea
            Party is not informatively described as a conservative
            political movement, because its signal influence is the insistence that
            the Right stop losing Chicken games. It demands “credible commitment”
            through the minimization of discretion on the part of its political
            representatives, along with whatever insanity is needed
            <em>not to fricking swerve</em>. This is of course highly — even totally
            — antagonistic. It is why the Left media now sound like
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/discombobulation/">this</a>. Before
            all significance is consumed in partisan rhetoric, it is important to
            note that the loser in a Chicken game — even the merely probabilistic
            virtual loser — <em>necessarily thinks that its opponent is insane</em>.
            Any more moderate response would be the infallible sign that losing was
            inevitable (once again).
          </p>
          <p>
            It isn’t hard to understand why this might be happening. In reiterated
            Chicken, the loser no doubt acquires a predisposition to submissiveness
            (“it’s hopeless, those lunatics always win”), but the objective
            undercurrent of repeated defeat is a contraction of the distance between
            relative (asymmetric) and absolute (mutual) defeat. Eventually, the
            difference isn’t worth surrendering — or swerving –over. “If they keep
            on winning, there will be nothing left anyway, so we might as well
            finish it now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Reciprocally, incessant victory threatens to dull revolutionary fervor
            into conservatism. Progressives now have many generations of substantial
            victory to defend, so taking things to the edge has begun to seem
            concerning. When the government shuts down, what does the Right really
            lose? At the very least, it’s beginning to wonder, and by doing so,
            upping its Chicken game (AKA “going insane”). Progressives don’t have to
            wonder.  They lose the government.

          </a>
          <p>
            As a preliminary, a little XS
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chicken/">background</a>, which I’ll
            aim not to repeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The take on Trump’s advantage that seems under-emphasized:
            <em>He credibly signals a refusal to swerve</em>. I’m not arguing here
            that it’s realistic to trust that. The point is only, the Trump
            candidacy looks to a substantial swathe of the electorate — at least
            comparatively — like the strategic choice for not losing at chicken
            games. As noted in the linked post, when democratic party politics
            becomes highly
            <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/packages/political-polarization/">polarized</a>, that’s the game being
            played.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone playing chicken through an agent prioritizes certain definite
            virtues. Trump’s rhetoric reflects these uncannily. “Winning” — for
            instance — is a word to watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see what it is to be a chicken game loser, there’s no better model
            than recent GOP presidential candidates. John McCain appeared to
            positively delight in the honor of being defeated by Barack Obama in
            2008, and Mitt Romney followed quite faithfully in his footsteps. In
            both cases, which can be extended to the GOP establishment generally,
            respectability is defined by the sentiment: “Sure, winning would be
            nice, but we’re not going to be crazy about it.” If there’s a single key
            to winning at chicken, however, ‘crazy’ is it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greater the media onslaught against Trump, given only
            <em>that he doesn’t flinch</em>, the stronger the signal that he’s not a
            swerve kind of guy. In this respect, the specific content of the attacks
            is almost irrelevant. The nastier the better. Best of all, if the
            message gets communicated that
            <em>this maniac would take us over the cliff</em>, he’s already won.
            From the perspective of this analysis, there’s simply nothing else he
            has to get across. It translates to:
            <em>With Trump we either win, or at least don’t lose</em>. (Objection:
            “But ‘everyone dies’ is losing isn’t it?” — Thanks GOPe, but you’re not
            getting this at all.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Cruz and (to a parodic extent) Rubio look <em>flexible</em> next to
            Trump. It’s not that people think they might swerve — it’s what they
            firmly expect. They seem bendy, and specifically prone to compromise,
            concessions to media-fabricated realities, back-downs, apologies, and
            pre-emptive cringe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never, ever, even for a moment back-down, laugh at demands for
            ‘disavowal’, double-down on offense, concede nothing, and
            <em>never swerve</em>. Regardless of what one thinks about this
            orientation, it’s the one hungered for by the Trump constituency right
            now. Trump’s instincts, if not perfect in this regard, are impressively
            sound. We’ll know within 24-hours or so how it’s working out.

            Partly because there can simply never be enough of
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/lord-of-the-trolls/">this</a>, but
            also for other reasons, this idea is perfectly delicious. It would be
            like a Sokal tar-baby, spreading sticky black paranoid confusion
            throughout the redoubts of the enemy. To make this work, however, would
            require a very exceptional type of genius (of exactly the kind
            demonstrated in the Shea case). Judging the precise extent and flavors
            of absurdity that the left will endorse — or at least find credibly
            non-parodic — is a rare and delicate art, especially since they have to
            be taken to the very edge, teetering prominently into gulfs of roaring
            madness. In addition, since effectiveness would correspond closely with
            persistence, the work involved would be immense.

            Modeling strategy on espionage and the double-agent, rather than
            military confrontation and the hero-warrior, would do much to burn-off
            ludicrous romanticism, replacing theatrical attitude with realist
            cunning. As with anything that involves demonstrated performance of a
            complex feat, rather than grandiose proclamations of antagonism, it
            would require actual cognitive achievement. Given basic facts about
            numbers and capabilities, infiltration is almost certainly something
            that will eventually need to be done.

            Such subversion would also be an experiment in practical metaphysics.
            How are identities assembled? What are agents? How do expressed values
            coordinate with effective activity? These questions are destined to
            explosive complication in the ragged, techno-psychological world to
            come, so it is worth tangling with them early, and intricately. Making
            biorealism an excuse to regress into paleolithic brotherhoods is a
            temptation to be torched-out ruthlessly by Internet machinations. Turn
            social Cyberspace into a jungle, where camouflage and complexity rule.

            <h4 class="post-title">Poe’s Law</h4>
          </a>
          <p>
            Only a few months ago, I had never heard of Poe’s
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law">Law</a>. Now it’s a
            rare day in which it doesn’t crop up several times. Invocations of the
            <em>Zeitgeist</em> are inherently improbable, but if there were to be a
            persuasive illustration of the phenomenon, it would be something like
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the succinct Wikipedia entry (already linked), Poe’s Law is
            less than a decade old. Among it’s precursors, also relatively recent, a
            2001 Usenet comment by Alan Morgan most closely anticipates it: “Any
            sufficiently advanced troll is indistinguishable from a genuine kook.”
            In other words, between a sincere intellectual position and its
            satirization, no secure distinction can be made. (There is nothing about
            this thesis that restricts it to ‘extreme’ opinion, although that is how
            it is usually understood.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The latest opportunity for raising this topic is, of course,
            <a
              href="https://storify.com/BecketAdams/salon-parody-account?utm_source=story&amp;utm_media=storypage&amp;utm_content=related">@Salondotcom</a>.
            (There’s an entertaining interview with the pranksters behind it
            <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/17/wth-twitter-suspends-salondotcom/">here</a>.) The offense of this
            account, which led to it being suspended by
            Twitter last week, was clear beyond any reasonable doubt. Quite simply,
            it was nearly indistinguishable from the original, a fact that has
            itself been explicitly noted (and tweeted about) innumerable times.
            Parody <em>Salon</em> slugs, so ludicrously over-the-top that they had
            @Salondotcom readers in stitches, were funny precisely because they were
            such plausible mimics of <em>Salon</em>‘s own. Readers were laughing
            <em>through</em> @Salondotcom, at <em>Salon</em>. This is almost
            certainly why the account was suspended.

          <p>
            Poe’s Law is ultimately indistinguishable from another recent, rapidly
            popularized rhetorical concept: the Ideological Turing
            <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html">Test</a>. An intellectual
            criticism
            can
            be said to understand its foe if it is
            able to reproduce it with adequate fidelity. The ITT is therefore a
            cultural procedure for winnowing-out straw-man arguments and other
            misrepresentations. If you cannot imitate the enemy case, you cannot be
            considered to have engaged it seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evidently, Poe’s Law can be construed as a filter of the same kind.
            Satire is effective to exactly the extent it can be confused with the
            satirized. (This can be taken in comparatively serious
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/imitation-games/">directions</a>.)
          </p>
          <p>
            What Poe’s Law tells us, is that antagonism is irreducible to
            argumentation. It is thus inherently anti-dialectical (and thus tacitly
            secessionist). There can be <em>perfect understanding</em> of what the
            enemy is saying, without even the slightest degree of approach to
            consensus. In other words, there are discrepancies entirely indissoluble
            in discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cutting satire does not reconstruct a cognitive position in order to
            make it laughable. Instead, it re-states such a position, as faithfully
            as possible, within the register of laughter — which is to say:
            <em>hostility</em>. It asserts a dissensus that no process of
            reconciliation can ameliorate. Our ‘disagreement’ is not the sign of a
            missing conversation. It is the call for a coming split.

            <a href="http://www.newinternationaloutlook.com/2014/07/21/expansion-on-aaa/">here</a>, it opens an
            unexplored
            horizon for strategic discussion within NRx.
            No analysis of cultural conflict on the Internet can bypass a reference
            to <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/chaos-patch-19/">trolling</a>,
            and no understanding of trolling is any longer complete without
            reference to AAA. It raises the discussion of
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/poes-law/">parody</a> to a new
            level. (If it isn’t already obvious, this blog is seriously impressed.)

            AAA works if strategic complication has favorable consequences.
            Whichever cultural faction has the greater capacity for the tolerance of
            difficulty, identity confusion, irony, and humor, will tend to find
            advantage in it. I think that’s us. It’s inherently toxic to zealotry.

            evolution in the Cthulhu Wars. (Check out the graphics on the TNIO post
            for recognition of that.) Rather than arguing over whether “Cthulhu

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“… those who consider themselves modern American revolutionaries
              often envision manning barricades and mass revolt as the undoing of
              the government. That attacks the government at its greatest strength —
              its capacity to use force and violence. The US government has at its
              disposal the most potent military and surveillance capabilities ever
              assembled. … […] The idea that some sort of mass movement will rise
              and by force of its inferior arms throw off the yoke of oppression is
              the stuff of weak novels, not a real life strategy that has a chance
              of success. Those who buy into it and attempt implementation commit
              the biggest strategic failure: they have fooled themselves.
              Consequently, their enemy — the government — profits. It uses their
              failure to justify further tyranny and repression.</em>
          </p>
          <em>
            <p>
              There is surprisingly little written about attacking the government at
              its weakest point: its financial dependence … An offensive would
              require a mass movement far less massive than that required for armed
              revolt, and its tactics would be legal. A few million simultaneous
              phone calls and requests via websites for the withdrawal of balances
              from banks, money market funds, and stock and bond mutual funds would
              precipitate a financial panic. None of those institutions keep enough
              cash on hand to meet a tsunami of redemption and withdrawal requests.
              They’d have to sell their assets to raise cash. The prices of those
              assets would drop, begetting further selling; negative crowd
              psychology and wealth effects would kick in as markets crash, and debt
              and economic activity would contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="more-6303"></span>The biggest loser in all this would be the
              government. As prices for bonds drop, interest rates rise, increasing
              its debt service. As economic activity contracts, tax receipts drop,
              safety net spending rise, crony capitalists must be bailed out, and
              deficits expand. Except for interest on government debt rising (it was
              perceived as a safe haven) all of this happened during the last
              financial crises. A massive increase in government debt and central
              bank debt monetization forestalled complete disaster last time. Even
              some of their proponents admit that those palliatives are now
              exhausted. During the next crisis, interest rates will rise on
              government debt to reflect its increasing credit risk. […] Which will
              leave the government confronting, and being defeated by, one of its
              biggest whoppers: that the pieces of paper and computer notations its
              Treasury and central bank generate ultimately have value after decades
              of determined efforts to depreciate them. They’re simply pieces of
              paper and computer entries, and eventually they’re not going to buy
              any groceries for all those warriors and police the government’s
              counting on, or for anyone else. Currencies collapse just before
              governments do; witness Venezuela, with its Bolivar and its government
              in extremis.

          <p>
            <em>This outcome does not require a plan; it’s going to happen. Indeed,
              it’s already happening.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            When something is falling, push — but push intelligently. The fetish for
            popular violence among certain factions of the Alt-Right is simple
            idiocy. If a populace is still docile enough to support government
            deficit spending, it’s not going to be waging a guerrilla war anytime
            soon.

            with Powell, in attributing the phrase to Thomas L. Friedman (in a
            February 2003 column for the <em>New York Times</em>). Those with a
            diligent sense for historical detail might be able to accurately trace
            its spread amongst journalists and foreign policy officials, including
            Bob Woodward, Richard Armitage, and John Kerry. Regardless of such
            specifics, it captures the spirit of grand strategy during the
            Nullities, and explains why the US military is no longer of use for
            anything.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            In its rational usage, the military is a machine for the production of
            negative incentives. It is designed to hurt people and break things,
            with the understanding that in its optimal — deterrent and intimidatory
            — function, the actual exercise of these capabilities will not be
            necessary. When considered from a Clausewitzean perspective, as a policy
            instrument, usable military power is directly proportional to a credible
            threat of punishment. It sets boundaries to the behavior of (rational)
            potential antagonists, by projecting the probability of extreme negative
            outcomes if diplomatically-determined triggers are activated — or ‘red
            lines’ crossed.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            <span id="more-1182"></span>Frederick the Great said “Diplomacy without
            arms is like music without instruments” because there can be no
            discussion of political limits among sovereigns unless menace gives them
            meaning. “I’d really rather you didn’t do that” has no ‘really’ about
            it, unless a threat lurks at the edge of the stage (visible, but
            reserved). It’s a polite belch, at best. Positive incentives presuppose
            the boundaries set by negative incentives — there can be no bargaining
            over that which can be demanded without cost. Thus the words of the
            diplomat are refinements of a message that military capability crafts in
            its essentials, either in the first derivative (balance of power between
            armed alliances), or the second (the ‘internal’ security economy of
            coalitions). The rest is empty ceremony.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            Imperialism tends to the radical degeneration of diplomatic reason,
            because it dissolves borders, systematically effacing the ‘foreign’
            sphere. When this process has developed to the point that foreign and
            domestic policy are no longer distinguishable, the Pottery Barn Rule
            takes over. ‘Mission creep’ is the operational symptom of something
            deeper: the geostrategic abolition of proprietary boundaries, of a kind
            that allow for the possibility of restricted sympathies, or the
            recognition of <em>alien interests</em>. The mature empire cannot
            threaten anything or anybody without immediately threatening itself.
            Hence its profound alignment with universal moral ideologies, whose
            particular selves gush unimpeded into the world soul.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            When, in the early years of the new millennium, President ‘Godzilla’
            Dubya Bush unleashed Operation Pottery Barnstorm on various societies
            loosely associated with the wreckage of the New York skyline, it was
            understood from the beginning that the populations on the receiving end
            were already honorary New Yorkers, absent from the Twin Towers on the
            morning of September 11, 2001 only by insignificant sociological
            coincidence. This ‘fact’ was an explicit justification for the US
            response, which expressed outrage at the victimization of a random
            sample of the world’s population by ‘criminals’ so backward they didn’t
            realize they were only hurting themselves. America’s ruling elite, in
            contrast, had attained this realization definitively enough to
            articulate it, for domestic = international consumption, as the Pottery
            Barn Rule.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            Once the Pottery Barn Rule becomes authoritative, the military is
            rationally unusable. It’s obvious why. Imagine a night-club bouncer
            saying, “Clear out of here, or I’m going to thrash you within an inch of
            your life – of course, I promise to take full responsibility for all the
            damage you incur from this righteous beating, covering all medical
            expenses, compensating you for loss of earnings, and negotiating in good
            faith to make reparation for all reasonable claims of emotional distress
            …” <em>This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you</em>. For the
            global administrative class, this is a truly beautiful illustration of
            evolved consciousness. Ordinary Americans, including the military, are
            less spiritually

            Two, or something altogether more sinister was going on. Foseti
            <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/review-of-the-last-lion-by-paul-reid/">clarifies</a>
            the conundrum beautifully:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When the US finally joins the war, it does so with – as best as one
              can decipher – only a few clear war aims: 1) demanding unconditional
              surrender (of Germany and Japan – aka the only bulwarks against Soviet
              domination of post-war Europe and Asia); 2) establishing the United
              Nations; and 3) ending European (excluding Soviet) colonialism.</em>

              be more destructive to mankind at the time than those, the next round
              is on me. Perhaps entirely coincidentally (or perhaps not) these aims
              would seem to all work towards the direct benefit of the Soviets. It’s

            panel discussion (third speaker, just after 43 minutes in). “The foreign
            policy establishment, or the country?” The relevant thread of his
            argument: The aggressive foreign policy posture of the United States is
            counter-productively promoting global disorder, which eventually
            threatens domestic calamity. When the US fights a foreign state, Lind
            argues, it advances the chaotic “forces of the fourth generation” — a
            more formidable opponent than even the most obdurately non-compliant
            state is able to be. America’s “offensive grand strategy” — tied to a
            high-level of concern for the internal political arrangements of foreign
            countries — is sowing dragon’s teeth.

            of broadened geopolitical scope. There is an unavoidable irony here. The
            Old Right tends naturally to a preoccupation with hearth-and-home, so
            that its preferred policy posture (non-interventionism) is often
            accompanied by — or even buried within — a retraction of mental energy
            from distant questions. The Neoconservative synthesis of foreign policy
            activism and cosmopolitan fascination with foreign affairs is far more
            psychologically consistent, regardless of its errors. For
            anti-globalists to sustain a panoramic perspective takes work.

          <p>
            This work is important, if realistic analysis is the goal, because
            distant eventualities hugely impinge. The existence and fate of
            Neoreaction depends far more upon the great churning machinery of world
            history than upon the local decisions of its favored ‘little platoons’.

            <span id="more-3290"></span>The fall of any empire involves an interplay
            of internal and external factors, knitted together in a relation of
            reciprocal amplification. The whole picture can never be solely a
            domestic one. By the time imperial destiny is a political question, it
            is already historical fact. It is too late, then, for simple denial. The
            thing is in motion. It cannot be asked not to have begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider only the most basic geopolitical structure of modernity — an
            ‘Atlantean’ world order consolidated, in succession, by the hegemonic
            maritime-commercial republics of the United Provinces, the United
            Kingdom, and the United States. Even from this core narrative, much is
            already starkly evident.<br />
            (0) Modernity rests upon concrete foundations of world power.<br />
            (1) Global dominion has a distinctive ideological and cultural skew.<br />
            (2) The hegemonic role (and even, at its most abstract, ‘culture’) is
            more stable, and intrinsically determinate, than the supremacy of any
            specific power, which waxes and wanes over a shorter period. The role of
            the Modern Hegemon is an autonomous ‘office’ with its own continuous
            tradition.<br />
            (3) When the United States inherited the role of Atlantean leadership,
            it adopted a structure of responsibility that had not arisen from within
            the USA itself. On the contrary, the USA had gown up and into it. How
            America behaves in the world does not follow exclusively — and perhaps
            not even predominantly — from anything that America, as a specific
            country, is.<br />
            (4) There is no precedent within modernity for global hegemony to pass
            from a world power to its successor without a set of very distinctive
            ethnic characteristics being held in common. (The leading culture of
            modernity, to this point, has been consistently North-West European,
            Protestant, Liberal, Maritime-Commercial, and — since the late 17th
            century — English-speaking, rooted in Common Law tradition.) Since
            America is the terminus of this sequence, a passage beyond precedent is
            inevitable. This could take one of (only?) three possible forms:<br />
            (a) The USA immortalizes its hegemonic status<br />
            (b) The world passes into undirected anarchy<br />
            (c) Global hegemony departs from its multi-century cultural orbit into
            unfamiliar ethnic territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this is separable from the fate of globalization, or modernity.
            However attractive it may be, the idea that America, in particular, has
            any purely domestic cultural, ideological, or political options of
            significance is untenable. What happens to America happens, immediately,
            to the order of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, geopolitical history has reached the edge of modern
            precedent. There is no one to whom the torch of global leadership can be
            passed in keeping with the inner tradition of modern torch-passing
            ritual. In this very definite sense, modernity as it has been known
            reaches its end. This no doubt accounts for the underlying tone of
            mounting hysteria which accompanies America’s increasingly

            It is tempting to either embrace or reject the description of the United
            States as an ‘<a
              href="https://newleftreview.org/II/5/gopal-balakrishnan-hardt-and-negri-s-empire">empire</a>‘
            due
            to the clear rhetorical weight of this term. Partisan wrangling
            on these grounds is sure to continue, and even to intensify. It is not,
            however, the only basis upon which discussion can be pursued.
          </p>
          <p>
            A global power, it might be plausibly suggested, tends inevitably to the
            erosion of its domestic political space. As globalization is advanced
            under its auspices, distinctions between domestic and international
            concerns — ultimately uncertain in any case — become increasingly
            unpersuasive. Globalized capital and talent markets operate with least
            friction where they intersect the world’s economic core, while
            international division of labor, trade, migration, and cultural exchange
            wash over traditional localities. In the final analysis, the very notion
            of political domesticity survives only as a residual rebuke to the
            project of global ‘<a href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat">flattening</a>‘.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it can be convenient for moralists to interpret hegemonic power as
            a bad decision, it’s far closer to a fate (and in very definite
            <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/hegemonic-headaches/">respects</a> a
            tragic one). Any suggestion that America might have <em>chosen</em> not
            to lead the world is more of an appeal to sentiment and tactical
            partisan positioning than to realism. History has its tides, and
            eventually they change.

            America’s presently-ongoing
            <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ferguson&amp;src=tyah">Ferguson</a>
            turmoil underscores the trend to political de-domestication of the
            metropolis, through an explicit collapse of social order into a
            problematic of ‘<a
              href="http://fabiusmaximus.com/2014/08/14/4gw-ferguson-race-riots-police-insurgency-70811/">4GW</a>‘ (or
            ‘Fourth
            Generation Warfare’). Twitter is congested with
            observations of police militarization, friction-free transmission of
            equipment from US expeditionary forces into the hands of its domestic
            law enforcement agencies, and advisories from international irregular
            armies on best-practice for dealing with counter-insurgency operations.
            Beyond the partisan excitement, and euphoric tribalism, there is a
            recognition of broken boundaries, and the consolidation of an integrated
            US security machinery that no longer finds the discrimination between
            foreign and domestic enemies of practical use.
          </p>
          <p>
            This phenomenon, as such, has no unambiguous partisan implications. Even
            were critique of the

            the
            application of an essentially domestic political optic (partisan
            choice) to a matter of world-historic deep structure would remain a
            laughable error. The fate of America is not an American problem, at
            least, not exclusively. It concerns the order of the world.

              and techniques of power. A whole series of colonial models was brought
              back to the West, and the result was that the West could practice

            an obvious point beautifully:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… whatever the Administration has said about the purpose of an attack
              being to “degrade and deter” Syrian capabilities, but not to change
              the regime, everyone expects the attacks to be modest and brief, thus
              not to much affect the battlefield balance, and once ceased to stay
              ceased. That is because the Administration’s reticence at being drawn
              into the bowels of Syrian madness is both well established and well
              justified. The attacks, then, will likely not degrade or deter
              anything really; they will be offered up only as a safety net to catch
              the falling reputation of the President as it drops toward the nether
              regions of strategic oblivion.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This has all been so vividly sign-posted it is getting hard to see how
            even a ‘cosmetic’ effect is going to work. How can an operation
            pre-advertized as an awkward spasm of embarrassment be realistically
            expected to restore honor and credibility?

            contrarian argument, on the resilience of America’s shale industry in
            the face of the unfolding OPEC “price war”, is the pretext to host a
            discussion about a topic that is at once too huge to ignore, and too
            byzantine to elegantly comprehend. The most obvious complication —
            bypassed entirely by this article — is the harsher oil geopolitics,
            shaped by a Saudi-Russian proxy war over developments in the Middle East
            (and Russian backing of the Assad regime in Damascus, most
            particularly). I’m not expecting people here to be so ready to leave
            that aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly, though, the attempt to strangle the new tight-oil industry in
            its cradle is a blatantly telegraphed dimension of the present Saudi
            oil-pricing strategy, and one conforming to a consistent pattern. If
            Mullaney’s figures can be trusted, things could get intense:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… data from the state of North Dakota says the average cost per
              barrel in America’s top oil-producing state is only $42 — to make a
              10% return for rig owners. In McKenzie County, which boasts 72 of the
              state’s 188 oil rigs, the average production cost is just $30, the
              state says. Another 27 rigs are around $29.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If oil-price chicken is going to be exploring these depths, there’s
            going to be some exceptional pain among the world’s principal producers.

            the game over Syriza exactly right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In current discussions of what Greece might or might not get in the
              way of concessions from the Eurozone, there has so far been relatively
              little appreciation of one basic political reality: as far as the
              governments of Spain, Portugal, Ireland, probably Italy and perhaps
              even France are concerned, Syriza must fail and must be seen to fail.
              … […] And note: I haven’t even got on to the problem of how voters in
              Germany or Finland or the Netherlands would react to being told that
              Syriza had extracted concessions with its comic-book antics.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless Syriza-led Greece is hideously crucified, it wins — and what will
            be unfolding is an extremely brutal zero-sum game (in which Greece
            cannot be allowed to win). For the EU establishment, a Syriza success
            story would be a catastrophe of almost incomprehensible magnitude. It
            would bring with it an entire narrative of core institutional
            delegitimation, which in the case of the peripheral nations (as glossed
            by Lilico) runs: “… what we really should have done was to raise the
            minimum wage, hire back the public sector staff that had been fired, say
            we weren’t going to pay our debts to our eurozone partners, cosy up to
            the Russians and tell the Germans they didn’t feel nearly guilty enough
            about World War Two. Then everyone would have said we were ‘rock stars’
            and and forgiven our debts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s unthinkable that Germany could let this story put down roots in the
            fertile manure of renewed growth. Instead, there will be war by other
            means. Crucially, the more calamitously things now turn out for Greece,
            the more the EU will be strengthened, if only for a

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From the perspective of these eurozone governments, Syriza must fail.
              The best way for it to fail would be for it to capitulate utterly and
              crawl back to Greece with its tail between its legs and a few cosmetic
              patronising “concessions” such as renaming the “Troika” the
              “Consultative Committee” (or, if it makes them feel better, the
              “Symvouleftiki Epitropi”). If it won’t do that — and there’s a good
              chance that if it did try to do that then the Greek government would
              collapse, anyway — then things get a bit more complicated. Because if
              it’s bad and dangerous for Syriza to succeed inside the euro, it would
              be disastrous for it to succeed outside the euro.</em>

            Neoreactionaries are often talking about ‘oikos’ tacitly, even when they
            think they are concerned with something closer to the opposite. For
            there to be an ‘economy’ much has already to have been settled. (Unlike
            his liberarian precursors, Moldbug never assumes peace, but he betrays
            his inheritance by conceiving it as an original task — a foundation.)
            “Begin from the inside” — that’s the idea. The Outside is war.
          </p>
          <p>
            War is the truth of lies, the rule of rulelessness, anarchy and chaos as
            they are in reality (which is nothing at all like a simple negation of
            order). It is the ultimate tribunal, beyond which any appeal is a
            senseless prayer to the void. A ‘realism’ that resists such conclusions
            makes a mockery of the name.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-1957"></span>Peace is a certain way war can turn out, for

            As the social institution oriented to reality in the raw, the military
            has a latent authority that everyone recognizes (implicitly). Whenever
            military government does not rule, it is because of a provisional
            non-emergency (Schmitt). This is not seriously disputable.
          </p>
          <p>
            An aristocracy is a social arrangement that was decided by war, and when
            the war is forgotten the institution has no sustainable meaning. There
            is only one thing that can ‘bring back’ a king, and that is the end of
            peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The East India companies (Dutch and English) ran armies, because war was
            internal to economics as they practiced it. That was ‘colonialism’ (in
            the James Donald sense). Once the separation between war and commerce
            has been hardened into standard business procedures (and the imperialism
            that screens them from the outside), capitalism has surrendered its
            always-inexplicit claim to sovereignty, and thus to the future. There is
            no way it can be re-animated except out of the raw. This, above all, is
            why libertarianism cannot be saved from its own non-seriousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horror of war is that there are ‘no rules’. Anything is permitted,
            and the worst even becomes necessary. To think this is no lesser a
            challenge than the metaphysical engagement with the ‘thing-in-itself’ —
            and perhaps it is exactly the same thing. But then, it becomes important
            to ask: So how does it work? There are rules, but we misunderstood what
            rules really are (what ultimate rules are). In the end, it is the order
            of anarchy that rules. In order to comprehend any of this the peacetime
            soul must be reduced entirely to ashes, for something else to arise in
            its place. It is this task that Neoreaction is compelled to take up, and
            which it has — in several different ways — already taken up. Peace is
            the objective correlate of the deluded mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            If war is the worst thing in the world, and the truth, then everything
            that isn’t horror is a lie.

            <a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/04/a-new-generation-of-unrestricted-warfare/">introduction</a>
            to the “new generation of unrestricted warfare”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui argued that war was no longer
              about “using armed forces to compel the enemy to submit to one’s will”
              in the classic
              <a href="http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK1ch01.html">Clausewitzian</a>
              sense. Rather, they asserted that war had evolved to “using all means,
              including armed force or non-armed force, military and non-military,
              and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s
              interests.” The barrier between soldiers and civilians would
              fundamentally be erased, because the battle would be everywhere. The
              number of new battlefields would be “virtually infinite,” and could
              include environmental warfare, financial warfare, trade warfare,
              cultural warfare, and legal warfare, to name just a few. They wrote of
              assassinating financial speculators to safeguard a nation’s financial
              security, setting up slush funds to influence opponents’ legislatures
              and governments, and buying controlling shares of stocks to convert an
              adversary’s major television and newspapers outlets into tools of
              media warfare. According to the editor’s note, Qiao argued in a
              subsequent interview that “the first rule of unrestricted warfare is
              that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden.” That vision clearly
              transcends any traditional notions of war.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            How ‘traditional’ are we talking? “War is the Father of all things, and
            of all things King” (πόλεμος πάντων μὲν πατήρ ἐστι, πάντων δὲ βασιλεύς)
            Heraclitus asserts at the dawn of philosophy. There seems little
            indication of ‘restriction’ there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the positive semantic associations accumulated by the word
            ‘war’, its most rigorous meaning is negative. War is conflict without
            significant constraint. As a game, it corresponds to the condition of
            unbounded defection, or trustlessness without limit. This is the
            Hobbesian understanding implicit in the phrase “war of all against all”
            (<em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em>), in which “the state of nature” is
            conceived – again negatively – through a notional subtraction of
            limitation. Treachery, in its game-theoretic sense, is not a minor theme
            within war, but a horizon to which war tends – the annihilation of all
            agreement. Reciprocally-excited mutual betrayal in departure from an
            implicit ‘common humanity’ is its teleological essence. This is a
            conclusion explicitly rejected by Carl von Clausewitz is his treatise
            <em>On War</em>, even as he acknowledges the cybernetic inclination to
            amplification (or “tendency to a limit”) which drives it in the
            direction of an absolute. “War is the continuation of politics by other
            means,” he insists, because it is framed by negotiation (book-ended by a
            declaration of war, and a peace treaty). According to this conception,
            it is an interlude of disagreement, which nevertheless remains
            irreducibly communicative, and fundamentally structured by the decisions
            of sovereign political agencies. Even as it approaches its pole of
            ultimate extremity, it never escapes its teleological dependency, as a
            means (or instrument) of rational statecraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reduction of war to instrumentality is not immune to criticism.
            Philosophical radicalization, alone, suffices to release war from its
            determination as ‘the game of princes’. The Clausewitzean formula is
            notoriously inverted by Michel Foucault into the maxim “politics is war
            by other means”. If political sovereignty is ultimately conditioned by
            the capability to prevail upon the battlefield, the norms of war can
            have no higher tribunal than military accomplishment. No real authority
            can transcend survival, or survive a sufficiently radical defeat. There
            is thus a final incoherence to any convinced appeal to the ‘laws of
            war’. The realistic conception of ‘limited war’ subsumes that of ‘war
            lawfully pursued’ (with the latter categorized as an elective
            limitation). Qiao’s words bear emphatic repetition: “the first rule of
            unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules, with nothing
            forbidden.” The power to forbid is — first of all — power, which war
            (alone) distributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between peace and war there is no true symmetry. Peace presupposes
            pacification, and that is a military outcome. There is no authority —
            moral or political — that cannot first assert itself under cosmic
            conditions that are primordially indifferent to normativity. Whatever
            cannot defend its existence has its case dumped in the trash.

            us with a contemporary restatement of the ancient wisdom:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who
              has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for
              such a player has labored clanking to his moment which will tell if he
              is to die at that man’s hand or that man at his. What more certain
              validation of a man’s worth could there be? This enhancement of the
              game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of
              fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute
              and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so
              profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such
              games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the
              decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular
              arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence.
              This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the
              authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of
              divination. It is the testing of one’s will and the will of another
              within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore
              forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a
              forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.</em>

            <em>The universe had once been bright, too. For a short time after the
              big bang, all matter existed in the, and only after the universe
              turned to burnt ash did heavy elements precipitate out of the darkness
              and form planets and life. Darkness was the mother of life and
              civilization.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The dark forest is the universe, but to get there — with insight — takes
            a path through Cosmic Sociology:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“See how the stars are points? The factors of chaos and randomness in
              the complex makeups of every civilized society in the universe get
              filtered out by distance, so those civilizations can act as reference
              points that are relatively easy to manipulate mathematically.”<br />
              “But there’s nothing concrete to study in your cosmic sociology, Dr.
              Ye. Surveys and experiments aren’t really possible.”<br />
              “That means your ultimate result will be purely theoretical. Like
              Euclid’s geometry, you’ll set up a few simple axioms at first, then
              derive an overall theoretic system using those axioms as a
              foundation.”<br />
              “It’s all fascinating, but what would the axioms of cosmic sociology
              be?”<br />
              “First: Survuival is the primary need of civilization. Second:
              Civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in
              the universe remains constant.”<br />
              …<br />
              “Those two axioms are solid enough from a sociological perspective …
              but you rattled them off so quickly, like you’d already worked them
              out,” Luo Ji said, a little surprised.<br />
              “I’ve been thinking about this for most of my life, but I’ve never
              spoken about it with anyone before. I don’t know why, really. … One
              more thing: To derive a basic picture of cosmic sociology from these
              two axioms, you need two other important concepts: chains of
              suspicion, and the technological explosion.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-5749"></span>The derivation from these axioms is the
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/exterminator/">Exterminator</a>.
            Resource conflicts between civilizations follow strictly from the two
            axioms. Game-theoretic tension is added by irreducible suspicion, and
            technological explosion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“That’s the most important aspect of the chain of suspicion. It’s
              unrelated to the civilizations’s own morality and social structure. …
              Regardless of whether civilizations are internally benevolent or
              malicious, when they enter the web formed by the chains of suspicion,
              the’re all identical”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is to say, they are all threats to each other, intrinsically, and
            irresolvably. Technological explosion means that any civilization
            represents a potential menace of inestimable potential, escalating
            massively within a span of mere centuries, and “On the scale of the
            universe, several hundred years is the snap of a finger.” An intolerable
            danger, then.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“That’s … that’s really dark.”<br />
              “The real universe is just that black.” Luo Ji waved a hand, feeding
              the darkness as if stroking velvet. “The universe is a dark forest.
              Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like
              a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying
              to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter
              has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy
              hunters like him. If he finds other life — another hunter, an angel,
              or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a
              demigod — there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate
              them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any
              life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is
              the picture of cosmic civilization. It’s the explanation for the Fermi
              Paradox.”</em>

            <em>When the deterrent is the complete destruction of the deterrer and
              the deteree, the system is said to be in a state of ultimate
              deterrence. […] Compared to other types of deterrence, ultimate
              deterrence is distinguished by the fact that, should deterrence fail,
              carrying out the threat would be of no benefit to the deterrer. [..]
              Thus, the key to the success of ultimate deterrence is the belief by
              the deteree that the threat will almost certainly be carried out if

            As Napoleon famously advised: “Never interrupt your enemy when he’s
            making a mistake.” Understandably, but still unfortunately, the Egyptian

            <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/352770/intricacies-egypts-coup-d-tat-daniel-pipes">this</a>:
            “Morsi
            was removed from power too soon to discredit Islamism as much
            as he should have.” It took seven decades of chronic failure to
            associate the Marxist command economy with hopeless dysfunction in the
            eyes of the world, and even then, the lesson remains far from complete.
            It can scarcely be imagined that a few months of Muslim Brotherhood
            misgovernment is going to sear any lasting scars into the global Islamic
            soul. So: an opportunity missed.

            Clearly, the forces of the Egyptian deep state were in no position to be
            as utterly indifferent to humanitarian considerations as
            <em>Outside in</em>. Their hand was forced, since whatever the
            educational virtues of mass starvation, it takes a certain distance to
            fully appreciate them. In any case, with Egypt now clearly unsprung, it
            is at least possible to find entertainment in the spectacle of popular
            anti-democratic protest, concluding in firework celebrations of
            authoritarian restoration.

            When confronted by large-scale — and thus complex – historical events,

            processes (‘revolution’, modernization, escalation, phase-change …), it
            is only through reference to concrete historical episodes that such
            intellectual tools acquire the richness necessary for successful
            application to actual world events. Even the most conceptually-refined
            historiographical language is honed for analogical usage. There is no
            ‘idea’ of ‘revolution’ truly separable from the examples of revolution
            provided by the historical record, and even if there was, it could have
            no use. Since history is rhythmic, but never exactly repetitive, such
            analogies can be more or less relevant, but only ever roughly
            suggestive. They are, in any case, unavoidable.

            During the years immediately following 9/11, Western perceptions of the
            new global reality were controlled by analogy with World War II, and
            even those who rejected this template were locked into a negative
            relationship with it. If 9/11 was not Pearl Harbor, or anything like it,
            it remained necessary to say so, repeatedly, and to little immediate
            effect. The term ‘Islamofascism’ was inherited from this period, and its
            fading currency is significant (as we shall see).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-921"></span>On the Left, resistance to the WWII analogy
            was relatively frictionless, because it was already, from the moment of
            its inception, outweighed by an alternative analogy, drawn from Cold War
            ‘anti-imperialist’ revolution. Bin Laden could never be a new Hitler, to
            those who had already recognized him as a new Ho Chi Minh. On the Right,
            however, intricate ironies abounded. Those on the paleo-libertarian end
            of the political spectrum, who most vehemently denounced the ‘Axis of
            Evil’ as a cynical fabrication, were propelled by events into an
            accelerated rediscovery of the Old Right, and thus found themselves –
            quite self-consciously — reviving 1930s American isolationism. Through
            the very rejection of the (WWII) analogy, they found themselves
            confirming its rough historical message.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the West returning to the 1930s? That is another topic, although it
            can be noted that evidence in support of this analogy has accumulated
            over recent years at least  as rapidly as it has dissipated. To the
            extent that the ‘War on Terror’ is World War II revisited, however, it
            is only under the conditions of a profound counter-factual revision, in
            which the American Old Right was ultimately triumphant, and vindicated.
            The Islamic world simply lacks the military capability to serve as model
            fascists, posing a robust existential threat that feeds continuous
            escalation. America has not remotely approached a 1940s war economy in
            the new millennium, and there is nothing that any Islamic power — formal
            or informal — can do to stimulate this outcome. A few ragged,
            frustrating counter-insurgencies do not make a world war. For America,
            the War on Terror — in any sense that has analogical force — is over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opportunity thus exists to shelve the Western perspective on
            international affairs, a methodical step that tracks the concrete
            draw-down of interventionist commitment, and one that — by further irony
            — promises a far deeper comprehension of what current global events will
            mean for the West (down the road). The critical first point is this: the
            end of the ‘War on Terror’ is not the end of the war wracking the world
            of Islam, but something far closer to its beginning. If the Arabs, too,
            are returning to the 1930s, it is in a very different way, in accordance
            with a far more comprehensive structure of history.

            Anybody who has been hanging out in <em>Al Jazeera</em> recently (and,
            right now, there’s no excuse not to), might have come across an
            extremely significant
            <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/05/2013567200437919.html">essay</a>
            by Murtaza Hussain, entitled
            <em>Iraq, Syria, and the death of the modern Middle East</em>. Hussain
            has no doubts that a back-to-the-1930s moment is unfolding in
            Mesopotamia, or rather — the truly crucial insight —
            <em>a back through the 1920s moment</em>, with reverse time signature.
            The Middle East is not so much recapitulating history from the early
            20th century, <em>as undoing it</em>, revisiting the origins of the Arab
            state system on a hardening, backwards trajectory:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Sykes-Picot Agreement – which divided the Ottoman Empire after
              World War I and created the Middle East as we know it – is today
              violently breaking apart in front of the eyes of the world. The
              countries of Syria and Iraq; formerly unified Arab states formed after
              the defeat of their former Ottoman rulers, exist today only in name.
              In their place what appears most likely to come into existence – after
              the bloodshed subsides – are small, ethnically and religiously
              homogenous statelets: weak and easily manipulated, where their
              progenitors at their peaks were robustly independent powers.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Such states, divided upon sectarian lines, would be politically
              pliable, isolated and enfeebled, and thus utterly incapable of
              offering a meaningful defence against foreign interventionism in the
              region. Given the implications for the Middle East, where overt
              foreign aggression has been a consistent theme for decades, there is
              reason to believe that this state of affairs has been consciously
              engineered.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hussain’s conviction of alien manipulation — however plausible or
            implausible it may seem — is itself a crucial part of the equation. The
            Arab world is being propelled backwards, out of political modernity, by
            forces of such consistent directionality and monumental implacability
            that they suggest conspiratorial or providential workings, against which
            resistance is futile. Raw history, in all of its nightmarish, occult
            compulsion, is exposed like a buried city, as the facile myths of
            collective, institutionalized agency are blasted away by the flood. A
            dismal century of second-hand lies is being ripped away, revealing
            something old and terrible beneath. Eventually, this cannot but matter,
            for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World War II analogy was tightly bound to the (‘neoconservative’)
            project of democracy promotion. After all, the original Axis powers were
            all transformed, through military defeat, occupation, and political
            reconstruction, from fascist states into model democracies. Hussain’s
            vision is far more accurately applicable to the current
            process-in-motion, which does not climax in an affirmation of political
            modernity, but accelerates back through its comprehensive demolition.
            Global democracy will not easily or rapidly die in the wake of the ‘Arab
            Spring’, but global
            <a
              href="http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/judy-bachrach/democracy-still-uneasy-export">democratization</a>,
            or democracy promotion, assuredly will.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the War on Terror to the Arab Spring, there is a shift in analogy
            of seismic consequence. It is no longer World War II that impinges
            forcefully on historical intuition, but
            <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/NB28Dj06.html">rather</a>
            the Thirty Years’  War,
            <em>approached through momentous regression</em>. The collapse of the
            Sykes-Picot order, when analogized, is an undoing of the Peace of
            Westphalia — and the international state system — by sectarian religious
            warfare without respect for borders or institutions of national
            self-determination. The conditions for democratizing  social progress
            are being ripped out at the level of their foundations. This was not
            what ‘internationalism’  was supposed to mean …

          </a>
          <p>
            The central contention advanced by
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-part-1/">part 1</a>
            in this series is that the basic trend manifested in the Middle East
            today – most evidently across its northern arc — is the disintegration
            of the modern state system (and with it all the questions of political
            progress that have been incrementally globalized since the Treaty of
            Westphalia in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century). To continue to discuss
            this process in terms of ‘Lebanon’, ‘Syria’, and ‘Iraq’ is becoming
            increasingly quaint. Within this region, in particular, states no longer
            conform to contiguous territories, but rather to hubs, characterized by
            the inheritance of a comparatively organized security apparatus, a
            vestigial international status (also inherited, from the dissolving
            state system), and specifically a recognized
            <i>Westphalian-era</i> territorial sovereignty, stripped of domestic
            credibility. A realistic political geography of the emerging northern
            Middle East begins from this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the names of nation states can only suggest (Westphalian)
            contiguous jig-saw pieces, it is essential to understanding that we
            start elsewhere. <i>The Crescent</i>, stretching from western Iran,
            through Iraq, and Syria, to the Lebanese Levant, spilling – no doubt –
            into south-eastern Turkey to the north, and down into the northern Gulf
            states and Jordan to the south, can be considered an exaggerated Fertile
            Crescent, a (Sunni-paranoiac) Shia Crescent, a Crescent of
            Disintegration, it doesn’t matter. What is important is that the state
            apparatuses (and international political sovereigns) existing in this
            area occupy it in the manner of islands,
            <i>populating or inhabiting it</i> — among other collective bodies of
            strategic consequence — rather than dividing it effectively among
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Crescent is maximally extended to the eastern borders of Iran
            (and perhaps further into the Hazara areas of Afghanistan, and Quetta in
            Pakistan), northwards into Azerbaijan and blurrily into the areas of
            Anatolian Alevi ethnicity, and south along the western Gulf coast,
            encompassing Bahrain (but stretched further along the Saudi Gulf coast
            and beyond, into Yemen), it incorporates the entirety of Shia Islam as a
            strategically potent entity. Beyond this area, the Shia exist only as
            <a
              href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/74773/Egypt/Politics-/Angry-mob-kills-at-least--Shias-in-Giza-village.aspx">pogrom-fodder</a>
            among overwhelmingly dominant Sunni populations. Constituting something
            over 15% of Moslems worldwide, but over a third of those in the Middle
            East, the Shia either prevail in the Crescent, or go under. (For our
            purposes here Alawites / Alevi are Shia by strategic affiliation and
            adoption.)
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-925"></span>The Crescent is the site of <i>fitna</i>,
            Islam’s unsettled business, and the time of settlement is now due. How
            does the balance of forces appear?
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost dead center in the Crescent, are spread the – characteristically
            stateless – Kurds, divided between Iran, Turkey, ‘Iraq’, and ‘Syria’,
            and numbering perhaps 30 million (compared to a world Shia population of
            roughly 200 million). Although predominantly Sunni by confession,
            Kurdish nationalist aspiration dominates over sectarian identity. It
            comes as relief to our cognitive overload that they are playing a long
            game. We can bracket them for the moment
          </p>
          <p>
            To the north lies Turkey, a powerful, comparatively competent Sunni
            state, marginalized by its non-Arab ethnicity. The pursuit of
            neo-Ottoman ambitions at this point would draw Turkey into a snake-pit
            of unimaginable pain. I think we can assume defensive hedging from
            Turkey in the immediate future. If we can bracket the Kurds – who are
            central to Turkey’s interests and calculations — we can cautiously
            bracket Turkey as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the east lies Iran, another capable state, as territorially secure as
            anyone gets to be in this environment, and the wellspring of global Shia
            power. Iran is already heavily invested in the Crescent War, but it has
            the luxury of involvement from without, as a firm ally of Hizbollah, a
            major stakeholder in the Iraqi Shia regime, and the local ‘superpower’
            ally of Assad’s Alawite rump state. (We shall get to examine Iran more
            closely when examining the nuclear proliferation aspect of this story,
            further down the road.)
          </p>
          <p>
            To the south things get very complicated. Jordan, an extremely fragile
            Sunni state, is almost certainly
            <a
              href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/07/29/rising-violence-putting-strain-on-jordan/">doomed</a>,
            but its collapse will widen the Crescent War into a far more
            multidimensional conflict. If we ignore it now it is less because we
            <i>can</i> ignore it, than because we simply <i>have</i> to ignore it.
            The limits of our processing capacity are exceeded. Similarly, to the
            east, where the tentacles of <i>fitna</i> snake down along the Gulf
            coast, through rich, demographically fragile micro-states, tightly woven
            into the US-dominated international system by hydrocarbon production.
            This is the royal road to world war. It’s too much to deal with right
            now. (Free-ranging commentary is, of course, welcome.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the transparent arbitrariness with which we have cropped the
            Crescent down to something like a manageable zone of attention, the core
            that remains has a number of coherent features. Most obviously, it is
            already a battlefield, in which the return to a pre-Westphalian ‘order’
            is substantially accomplished. On the Mediterranean coast, a tenuous
            hybrid Sunni-Christian Levantine statelet coexists with a Hizbollah
            (Shia) para-state, awaiting the resumption of

            This Crescent Core is occupied by two rump states, one clearly reduced
            to a compressed fiefdom (under Assad), the other still able to pretend
            to national authority. Each is an apparatus of Shia power, and thus a
            target for a Sunni-Jihadist onslaught of

            realizes its world historic mission. The local Sunni-Arab population
            engaged in escalating holy war against these states is not meaningfully
            differentiated by (Sykes-Picot) national identity. Humpty-Dumpty is

            irreparably.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the international Sunni-Jihadi movement, the destruction of these
            rump states is now a matter of eschatological significance. Their
            defense is of no less importance to their Shia supporters, for whom the
            Crescent Core war is a zone of existential decision. The entire history
            of Islam, on both of its dominant branches, is fully engaged in this
            conflict, whose meaning, for the entire (split) <i>Ummah</i> is
            unsurpassable. It is impossible to over-estimate the stakes, as Islam
            itself perceives them, and the wider world has not yet seriously begun
            to apprehend what is happening. (Palestine or Afghanistan mean nothing
            in comparison — as the revealed pattern of practical Jihad makes clear.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Does anybody seriously think they’re going to end this, with a
            recognizable world order in place? If not … what’s next?

          <p>The cartoon would look something like this:</p>
          <p>
            An Egyptian (or it could be a Pakistani) walks into the Bank of America,
            with a hand-grenade daubed ‘Radical Islam’ taped to his ear, and shouts
            out: “Hand over the money or my head gets it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The teller looks up and says: “You don’t have to keep doing this.
            There’s a standing order to pay you $1,500,000,000 a year.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Offended, the Egyptian replies: “But the grenade is the only reason you
            respect me!”
          </p>
          <p>
            We could try to update the joke (… “then the black lesbian bank teller
            says: ‘Why are you repressing that grenade?’”) but there’s going to be
            more than enough torture in this story already. It suffices to note that
            in the Egyptian version of the cartoon, the grenade was provided by the
            bank, and its inscription read: ‘Democracy’. We can fast-forward
            straight through the explosion stage, and begin on the far side of the
            ‘Arab Spring’.

            (even if it doesn’t sound like one): How did the first comprehensively

            blood would have been hard-pressed to envisage such a scenario. And in
            Egypt? There the dysfunctional ‘realist’ status quo – America’s
            multi-decade hand-grenade cartoon of a foreign policy – has given way to
            something quite different.

            Assume, hypothetically, that in Middle Eastern affairs the Obama
            Administration is by far the most mind-melting example of transcendental
            strategic genius the Anglophone world has ever known. (Are you with me
            so far?) Now add one straightforward corollary: In respect to Egypt, the
            goal was to replace a parasitic, dysfunctional, passive-aggressive PITA
            state, breeding Mohammed Attas like hogs in a factory farm, with a hard,
            Islamophobic, neoreactionary security state, fundamentally immunized
            against all democratic temptation, serving as a pole of attraction for
            counter-Jihad tendencies throughout the region, and machine-gunning even
            more Muslim Brothers in the streets than you really feel it needs to.
            Then, if it all works out, as a bonus you even get to threaten the $1.5
            billion standing order, whilst tut-tutting disapprovingly about the
            naughty coup business.
          </p>
          <p>
            To pull off this kind of unbelievable ju-jitsu requires a very special
            skill set, starting with a mastery of deception. A Sahara-dry, perfectly
            dead-pan sense of humor is not strictly necessary, but it adds to the
            sense of panache.

            You probably remember Dark-Lord Obama’s 2009 Cairo Speech, in very
            approximate outline, but do you recall the title? Here it is
            (seriously): <i>A New Beginning</i>. You’re forgiven a tingly ‘this is
            beyond awesome’ moment. (Probably <i>Now for Neoreaction</i>, or
            <i>Hard Reboot to the Future</i> were considered too blunt even for this
            Grand Imperial Wizard.) In an interview with <i>Al Arabiya</i>, Obama
            <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/PresidenttoMuslimWorldAmericansarenotyourenemy/">explained</a>
            with his signature stylistic felicity: “My job to the Muslim world is to
            communicate that the Americans are not your enemy.” From now on you’ll
            be killing your own damn people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bottom-line problem isn’t difficult to see: the passably civilized
            fraction of the Egyptian population is far too small to dominate their
            society, unless tightly compressed by bonds of fear, thoroughly
            disillusioned about the degraded state of their culture, invigorated by
            an urgent sense of responsibility to secure their own existence, and
            terminally freed of all democratic sentiment. Similarly, the regime
            itself needed to be quickened by existential terror, and driven into
            nakedly elitist alignment with a newly integrated, overtly anti-populist
            constituency. For all this to happen, Egypt had to be locked in a cage
            with itself, hardened by what it found there, until it had learned a
            lesson as old as the pharoahs. The state had to cease being a pandering
            platform and pan-handling operation, tailored to domestic populism and
            correct international opinion, and begin ensuring security,
            unapologetically, for the residue of civilization that still remained.
            But we already know what was required: A New Beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mubarak was grenade-guy. He had to go. The fact that he was using the
            Muslim Brotherhood in a groove-locked game of chicken with America was
            far from the most serious problem. He was also playing grenade-guy
            chicken with the local — uncondensed — non-Islamist demographic. By
            sheltering Egypt’s educated elite from their own bearded brethren, he
            was sustaining its most hopelessly sentimental illusions about the
            nature of the national <em>demos</em>, perpetuating democratic
            teleology, giving credence to the ‘international’ reform agenda, and
            deferring to the country’s radically corrupted (Islamo-populist)
            cultural template. Breaking with all this was something far beyond the
            Mubarak-circle’s political imagination. The country had to be
            <em>sprung</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the Obama master-plan remains far from complete (even without
            consideration of its application to Pakistan). The Egyptian economy is
            still skewed towards ruin by a deep structure of populist subsidies, and
            the recently installed order of neoreactionary legitimation has yet to
            be overtly proclaimed, or constitutionally formalized.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is nevertheless important to recognize how far things have come. The
            Obamazing feint-revolutionary double-flip-back maneuver has, in rapid
            succession, obliterated the accumulated credibility of the old
            (‘grenade-guy’) regime, ‘moderate’ Islamist governance,
            <em>and</em> democratic inclusion. A New Beginning already has the
            educated middle classes clamoring for a harsher clampdown on the bearded
            mob, and the security apparatus reaching out for robust political
            integration with the country’s civilized minority (the ‘Tamarrod’).

              culturally from the Egyptian faithful. One thing is certain after the

              Islamists. And for that they will need the army. The ballot box will

            This series was preparing for the flight out from Cairo International
            Airport, to go WMD hunting in the Crescent, when a call arrived – from
            Fotrkd (on
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-part-3/#comments">this</a>
            thread) – turning our plans back around. It was hard to pick out the
            exact message from the stream of excited babble, but it was basically:
            “You’re not going to believe what Kerry just said to the Pakistani’s …”
            (who, we have to remember, are next in line for <em>A New Beginning</em><span
              style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><em>®</em>.)<br />
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m guessing you’ve already heard it – since it’s all over the media.
            The

            together
            well (notice the encrypted message to Kerry in the
            URL: Ufu02Kzk2-k (!)):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“The military was asked to intervene by millions and millions of
              people, all of whom were afraid of descendance into chaos, into
              violence,” Kerry was quoted as having told Geo.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“And the military did not take over, to the best of our judgment – so
              far. To run the country, there’s a civilian government. In effect,
              they were restoring democracy,” he added.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><span id="more-936"></span>The interviewer questioned him over
              allegations that Egyptian troops have shot dead people in the
              streets.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“Oh, no. That’s not restoring democracy, and we’re very, very
              concerned… I’ve been in touch with all of the players there. And we
              have made it clear that that is absolutely unacceptable, it cannot
              happen,” Kerry said, according to AFP.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If history is being studied in human languages a thousand years from
            now, these words will still be reverberating. They need to be carved on
            a pyramid, or something. This is one of those rare moments in which
            <em>everything changes</em>, and we have to catch up with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s all about democracy, obviously, but the improvised card-sharping
            makes it easy to miss the way the trick plays out. The first important
            thing to note — and the assumed context of the <em>Geo</em> interview — 
            is that the initial reference to democracy, as crudely, procedurally,
            and up to this point pointedly understood, is scrubbed out and replaced.
            When the interview question begins, we all <em>know</em> that what is
            being talking about is the abrupt termination of Egypt’s brief and
            pitiful experiment in Cathedral-inspired democracy. After Kerry’s
            initial words, all that has already been shrouded. The topic has somehow
            slipped into “descendance into chaos, into violence” — and we’re not
            supposed to register that these words are translating
            <em>exactly the same thing</em> that ‘democracy’ previously named,
            because ‘democracy’ is about to mean something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of people (and they’re the people who matter) were  asking the
            military to intervene to shut down <del>democracy</del>
            <em>the descendance into chaos, into violence</em>, and a deal was
            quickly and efficiently done. The people who the military listen to got
            to borrow the military, and the military got to borrow a civilian face.
            The intimacy of this arrangement — and its deep neoreactionary sanity —
            has nothing at all to do with democratic legitimacy in its previously
            accepted (and now effaced) sense.  Kerry clearly doesn’t think that
            anyone will care about that. The right people took over, how could that
            possibly be a problem? (It’s not as if anyone ever complained about that
            Pinochet business.) But just in case some awkward memory of what we were
            supposed to believe last week is still hanging around, we now get the
            most exquisite political formula of the age:
            <em>In effect, they were restoring democracy</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words are too perfect. Sobbing with ecstasy could be embarrassing,
            so I’ll quote a little
            <a
              href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2013/08/02/white-house-losing-its-grip-on-the-middle-east/">WRM</a>
            while getting it together:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Let’s get the obvious parts out of the way: No, the Egyptian military
              is not restoring democracy in Egypt. You can’t “restore” something
              that never existed … […] The army wasn’t trying to build democracy,
              either; it was restoring order and protecting the deep state, more or
              less in accordance with the will of a large number of middle class and
              urban Egyptians. That’s the beginning and end of it. Americans
              desperately want somebody to be the pro-democracy good guys. But right
              now at least, democracy doesn’t seem to be on the menu at the Egypt
              café.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The structure of realization seems to go roughly like this:<br />
            (a) Democracy is the supreme Good, engraved eternally and universally in
            the human heart, but<br />
            (b) When an attempt is made to implement it almost anywhere on earth it
            immediately manifests as
            <em>a descendance into chaos, into violence</em>, and<br />
            (c) This existentially threatens the demographic which might be actually
            capable of sustaining a functional democracy, so<br />
            (d) In effect, the truly crucial step is the immediate cessation of
            <del>democracy</del> what was previously known as democracy, which
            therefore counts as<br />
            (e) A restoration of democracy.

            We need to remember that John Kerry might have been President of the
            United States, and the Muslim Brotherhood helpfully work with us in
            <a
              href="http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/mursi-loyalists-slam-kerry-comments-on-egypt-coup">thinking</a>
            that through:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Supporters of Egypt’s ousted president Mohamed Mursi today slammed US
              Secretary of State John Kerry after he said the military was
              “restoring democracy” by deposing the Islamist leader.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“Is it the job of the army to restore democracy?” asked Gehad
              al-Haddad, a spokesman for Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood in a
              statement.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“Does Secretary Kerry accept Defence Secretary (Chuck) Hagel to step
              in and remove (US President Barack) Obama if large protests take place
              in America?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“Will the US army freeze the constitution and dismantle Congress and
              (the) Senate? Can they appoint a president that they solely
              choose?”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Gehad al-Hadad still isn’t quite getting it. When invited by the right
            people, whatever the army has to do in overthrowing the government now
            <em>defines</em> the ‘restoration of democracy’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we get to the stage where the Middle East is re-exporting Kerryist
            democratic restoration, things could get extraordinarily interesting. At
            the present rate of Cathedralist ideological implosion, however, there
            might not be time for that.

            “This time is different” is a slogan designed for derision. Greer set me
            <a href="http://www.ufblog.net/the-shape-of-time-part-1/#more-52">back</a>
            onto it again, but it’s familiar background hum, and could have come
            from anywhere. In it’s most typical usage it applies to the psychology
            of business cycles, as the epitome of bubble denial, which is to say:
            investor hubris. (<a
              href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640">This</a>
            book might be the best known example.) With blunt irony, it is placed in
            the mouth of a fool, who is prompted to declare that things won’t turn
            out the same this time around (so <i>of course</i> they will). It’s what
            somebody is expected to say shortly before losing their shirt.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few quite simple things that can be said about the
            presumption, whether learned or instinctive, that things will almost
            certainly <i>not</i> be different ‘this time’.<br />
            — It is a cognitive stance that conforms almost perfectly with the
            dominant sense of ‘wisdom’.<br />
            — It is strongly aligned with the heuristic that history has important
            lessons to teach us (and that the lessons of deep history are especially
            profound).<br />
            — It is skeptical with respect to Utopian schemes of improvement.<br />
            — It has an emotional correlate, in aversion to enthusiasm.<br />
            — Every civilized (or even merely cultural) tradition has an
            identifiable version of it.<br />
            For all these reasons, it has a reactionary bias, due to its affinity
            with everything that resists the progressive impulse and its fantastic
            illusions. It remembers that change has happened before, and what
            happened when it did. Even when explicit, relevant memory is lacking, it
            assumes that tradition incorporates wisdom, and thus provides a bulwark
            against reckless enthusiasm. It is unmistakably biased, because there
            has been enough past to make it so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-939"></span>The guiding maxim of <i>Outside in</i> –
            <i>Optimize for intelligence</i> – is not primarily <i>wise</i>. Among
            the readers of this blog, however, wisdom is the prevalent mode of
            realism, and it is displayed in crushing abundance. When our
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-part-3a/">digression</a>
            into Egyptian practical neoreaction strayed into the exultant discovery
            of a <i>rare moment in which </i><em><i><b>everything changes</b></i></em><em>, </em>the push-back
            commentary
            was
            quick, hard, and relentlessly
            wise<em>. </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Learned wisdom, rooted in historical recollection, expects to be
            countered, usually by fools. Of all the things that have happened
            before, innumerable times, among the most common is a delirium of
            novelty, accompanied by rationalizations of greater or lesser
            sophistication. History is able to test doctrines of novelty, by
            excavating ancestral anticipations whose very existence amounts to a
            refutation. For any claim to the unprecedented, exposure to precedents
            is an embarrassment that cannot easily be survived.<em> </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            From an occluded future, the disturbance of wisdom can draw no
            sustenance, but history offers it partial refuge, in two interconnected
            ways. Firstly, it can contest the time-scale of normality, pushing
            expectations into deeper and more expansive cycles, in order to
            relativize a formation of wisdom to a long-settled innovation, whose
            ‘naturalness’ rests on nothing beyond a comparative durability of
            change. Wisdom is challenged to deepen its memory, and to recall the
            difference it has mistaken for a foundation. If anything done can be
            undone – and even has to be – then what will not be undone, in time?
            Every establishment was once established, and thus rests upon some
            sub-basement of historical fragility.<em> </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, the precedents of innovation, when
            <em>abstractly</em> apprehended, disturb wisdom more effectively than
            they support it. Sometimes it <em>has</em> been different, unless growth
            itself is an illusion. Everything, seized at the right scale, is new.
            Ultimately invention envelopes wisdom, rather than the contrary. (This
            is not, admittedly, an uncontroversial claim.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed each said “this time it’s different.” A
            sufficiently mechanical wisdom would even assert that, in this, they all
            said the same. At the very least, as original founders of distinctive
            establishments of wisdom, they each preclude a primordial refusal of
            innovation. An absolute wisdom would judge each worthy of crucifixion,
            or its equivalent in derision. If wisdom is to be the iron criterion,
            the Abrahamic faiths are all the works of great comedians. How could it
            be denied that — when strictly and consistently considered — religious
            inspiration is inherently unwise? (This is not a judgment I am
            dogmatically rejecting.)<em> </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The state, too, is an invention. It seems to be roughly as old as the
            institution of literate priesthood, with canons of wisdom to match. That
            time it was different, and recorded history began. Even then, a deeper
            and more enveloping wisdom can be conceived, associated with a lost (and
            unwritten) presumption: <em>this nonsense is not going to last</em>.
            Perhaps proto-states had been tried, and failed, innumerable times
            before. The prehistory of political abortions might even have exhibited
            sufficient richness to make the birth of the state
            <em>obviously foolish</em>. Equally, through a dilation of time-scales
            ultimately indistinguishable from wisdom itself, we can still stubbornly
            presume that this nonsense is not going to last. Or at least, if we
            refuse this presumption, judging it unrealistic, we have to do so as
            defenders of innovation, rather than as faithful voices of tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we return to the leading question of this series: what is the destiny
            of the Islamic State? Clearly, wisdom offers us no answer. The modes of
            reason engaged are quite different. We have to correctly identify the
            real innovations in the history of the state, and come to an equally
            realistic judgment about the relative priority of religious civilization
            and political order. Is the Islamic State a state, that happens —
            incidentally — to be Islamic? Or does Islam decide whether or not it is
            culturally tolerable to sustain a modern state? These questions are open
            to revision, and refinement, but the essential divergence of conclusions
            is inescapable. Either universal political science is possible, or it is
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            If universal politics is judged impossible, that is — in the delicate
            American turn of phrase — a BFD. The practical recognition of such a
            reality would make a difference, a durable change, and a disintegration
            of time. Islam either masters the state, or succumbs to it. That
            ‘choice’ is a war.

            The story that follows was stolen from somewhere, but I’ve not been able
            to recover the source. It has a definite neoconservative edge to it,
            which isn’t surprising given the early-nullities brain-feed it was no
            doubt extracted from, but it’s neat enough to be passed on.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires in space, the First World War
            was the equivalent burial ground in time. The German Second Reich, the
            Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) Empire, the Russian (Romanov) Empire, and
            the Turkish (Ottoman) Empire were all interred by it. In their place
            arose new geopolitical entities based upon an unstable mixture of
            ethno-nationalist self-determination and moral-universalist
            internationalism. The role of American ideas in the New Order – most
            immediately conveyed by the vehicle of ‘Wilsonism’ – was both
            substantial and ambiguous. A tight swirl of Americanization and
            Anti-Americanism would be essential to everything that followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Austro-Germanic imperial collapse can be considered one thing, for
            the sake of elegance, the true narrative marvel of this story can
            unfold, because each dead empire was the germ of a world war,
            structuring history in its fundamentals up to the present day. From each
            imperial grave, in succession, came a challenge to the Anglophone global
            order, distinct in certain respects, but also displaying common,
            recognizable features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-949"></span>Given what is being said of their origins, we
            can think of these sequenced global challenges as Undead Empires,
            re-animated from the ruins of the old order. In each case a
            supra-national ideological wave was radiated from an extinct crater of
            traditional authority, married in complex ways to ethno-nationalist
            impulses, and self-defined in explicit opposition to Anglo-Jewish
            planetary capitalism. First Central-European National-Socialism
            (1933-45), then Russo-centric Bolshevism (1946-89)*, and finally –
            because this narrative implies completion – from out of the Arabian
            hinterland of the broken Ottoman empire came the last of the great
            Undead Empires, the one that concerns us still.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eurasian Undead Empires have ceased to moan. Ghoulishly re-animated,
            then re-broken, and rebuilt, Germany dominates Europe once again, and
            Russia  has re-established itself as an assertive  autocracy with
            extensive, but strictly finite, reach. Neither any longer pursues its
            interests in the name of a cosmic ideology, as if its traumatic
            grievance deserved to shake the heavens. Neither still aches to burn
            down the world, in order to share the ruin it has known. The sullen
            grumbles they might still nurse have ceased to awaken the dead. Only
            normal disgruntlements remain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Islam remains in a very different place. The collapse of its last —
            Ottoman — Caliphate  was constitutionally formalized by Kemal Atatürk,
            the first President of the new Turkish Republic, on March 3, 1924. The
            cosmic ideology of Islamism is unintelligible without reference to that
            event. What political Islam wants, centrally, is the revival of the
            Caliphate. The Great War’s last curse thus determines it as an Undead
            Empire dreaming, in the lurid crypt-chatter of blood and screams …
          </p>
          <p>
            … which was the neoconservative nightmare, best articulated by
            center-left hawk Paul Berman in his
            <a
              href="http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Liberalism-Paul-Berman/dp/0393325555/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375716909&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=terror+and+liberalism"><em>Terror
                and Liberalism</em></a>. In compliance with the pattern of historical analogy here outlined,
            only one outcome was conceivable — a fourth world war. The ‘War on
            Terror’ was thus predicted, and promoted, until — after the best part of
            a decade — it had bled out into a parody of itself. The grating
            disproportion between the WoT’s tawdry squabbles on the one hand, and
            the apocalyptic confrontation which the narrative demanded on the other,
            had become unbridgeable. In a sense it was over. At least, attention
            wandered. Yet nothing had been settled, or laid to rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realism has to be more than ceasing to think, just as it must be more
            than a call to action. The story of the Undead Empires, now freed of
            neoconservative excitability, has either to be discarded
            <em>for a reason</em>,  or more thoroughly explored. Despite the
            directionless adventures that have attached themselves to it, the
            intrinsic plausibility of the narrative itself has not, by an iota, been
            diminished.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is most clearly demonstrated through simple elaboration of the
            pattern. World War II was an extremely intense global conflict, with a
            number of theaters simultaneously active, and total duration of less
            than a decade (from the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 to the
            surrender of Japan in 1945). World War III, in contrast, was so
            prolonged, and dilute (or ‘cold’), that it is generally considered not
            to have happened at all. Between the major hostile powers, deterrence
            predominated over active engagements, with the latter generally
            conducted as peripheral, asymmetric conflicts. (US military deaths
            approached 100,000 a year during WWII**, close to the country’s total
            toll — almost entirely from Korea and Vietnam — suffered over the 40
            years of ‘WWIII’).
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, simple extrapolation into WWIV gets nowhere near to a
            forecast. All it tells us is that there was never any reason to expect
            compact, burning Armageddon. The crude trend line (counting for nothing)
            projects 30,000 US military deaths over the course of a 200 year
            hyper-diffuse cryo-war. American narrative fundamentalist would depart
            from that as the ‘norm’. Not the ‘clash’, but the slow squelch of
            civilizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps more suggestive is the trend to involution. National Socialists,
            despite the diversion of the Holocaust, spent most of their time killing
            foreigners. The communist regimes of ‘WWIII’, in contrast, focused
            almost entirely on massacring their own populations, reaching a 9-figure
            body count over their ‘lifespans’. The vague narrative  ‘prediction’,
            therefore — which the word ‘war’ increasingly obfuscates — is that the
            long struggle to revive the Caliphate is an opportunity for
            Islamo-demographic self-cannibalization, on a scale that has only been
            delicately hinted at so far. The default pattern points to an extended
            hideous occurrence that is, almost entirely, inflicted by the
            <em>Ummah</em> upon itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only reason to be persuaded by this pattern is that, right now, it’s
            the only pattern we have …
          </p>
          <p>[Some involutionary carnage  in detail next]</p>
          <p>
            * These are Cold War dates, rather than internal Bolshevik regime dates
            (1917-89). The latter would contribute to a more intricate time
            structure, in which sequence took the form of historical envelopment,
            rather than simple succession. I’m trying to keep things cognitively
            manageable, for the moment.

            So – does Mecca get nuked? For the purpose of this series, that’s a
            reasonable candidate for the terminal question.
          </p>
          <p>
            A direct assault on this question stumbles quickly into a paradox of
            stimulating profundity. Of all the geopolitical and religious agencies
            determining the outcome, the one most theologically predisposed to the
            vaporization of Islam’s spiritual center is the Wahhabi sect, which
            presently controls it. The
            <a href="http://hyperstition.abstractdynamics.org/archives/003797.html">case</a>
            can easily be made that, within the limitations set by peacetime
            conditions, this objective has already been

            (If
            you noticed the Iranian media links there, save that
            observation.) Also worth mentioning: it’s a necessary antecedent to the
            Islamic Apocalypse (<em>al-Qiyamah</em>) that Mecca and the Kaaba be
            destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-983"></span>One of the factors supporting the
            Thirty-Years’ War analogy in the escalating conflict between Sunni and
            Shia Islam is the confidence with which we can identify the
            ‘Protestants’ and ‘Catholics’ in this re-run. In God and Gold (p.367),
            Walter Russell Mead outlines the structure of parallelism:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Wahhabis seek to suppress the popular cults associated with saints
              and others traditionally believed to intercede for believers with God.
              Every soul is accountable to God for its own acts, and there is no
              human mediator. Puritans similarly attacked the cults of the Christian
              saints, and argued that it was vain and unbiblical to pray to the
              Virgin and the saints for their intercession with God. To make sure
              such cults are suppressed, the Saudi government under Wahhabi
              influence has recently destroyed mosques and monuments in Mecca and
              Medina that had becomes associated with cults and customs considered
              un-Islamic. Puritans, like many radical Protestants across northern
              Europe, destroyed altar screens, stained glass, statues, and other
              church furnishings which, in their judgement, distracted the people
              from the worship of the one true God.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Shia Islam, with its far greater tolerance for cultural ‘thickness’, has
            a ‘Catholic’ alignment with heritage, tradition, and mediation. Sunni
            Islam — especially in its ‘Puritanical’ or radical Wahhabi, Salafi, and
            Takfiri variants, interprets intermediary forms of cultural and
            political organization as manifestations of impiety (to be erased). As
            with the militant Protestantism of the seventeenth century, its mode of
            holy war indissolubly fuses iconoclastic theology with the armed advance
            of the faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Radical Sunni ‘desert religion’ projects a desert as (and at) the end of
            faith. It cannot be realistically expected that cultural inhibitions on
            the escalation of violence will find fertile soil in this terrain. A
            geographically and demographically besieged Shiism shows every sign of
            counter-bidding unreservedly in its own eschatological coin.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are other inhibitions, however. When socially disorganized
            militants engage in informal warfare, the requirement that they protect
            their own neighborhoods from nebulous threats tends to what Gary Brecher
            <a href="http://exiledonline.com/wn-30-libya-cripple-fight/">calls</a>
            the ‘cripple fight’ phenomenon. There’s a reluctance to stray to far
            from home, when home is an informal war zone, which obstructs effective
            military mobilization. More generally, mass killing is technically
            difficult, and usually scales up with social competence (a few African
            counter-examples  notwithstanding).  Disease is the traditional
            mass-killer, supplanted by famine in modern times. Relatively
            low-efficiency slaughter is the modern Islamic norm. Hence the
            fascination with Weapons of Mass Destruction, and especially nuclear
            devices, as the prospective solution to the Jihad escalation problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dynamics of escalation can be modeled as a <em>chain reaction</em>,
            which can in turn be translated into the geopolitics as a
            <em>domino theory</em>. Such theories went out of fashion in the closing
            stages of the Cold War, because their predictions regarding the
            contagious virulence of communist regime-change began to look
            over-stretched. Where domino models clearly excel, however, is in the
            explanation of nuclear proliferation. Within such domino chains, the
            attainment of ‘nuclear status’ by power A serves as the sufficient
            <em>political</em> explanation for the subsequent attainment of nuclear
            status by power B, in a process that can be prolonged indefinitely,
            given a suitable linear network of threat links.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the active chain of nuclear dominoes leading into the Middle
            East (ignoring the non-contagious or here-irrelevant sub-branches, UK,
            France, Israel, and North Korea). The path leaves little room for
            controversy. In strict succession, driven by linear threat-response at
            each stage, it runs USA, USSR, China, India, Pakistan … and already we
            have an <em>Islamic  bomb</em>. It is crucial to note at this point that
            each link in nuclear dominoes (after the first) has to be Janus faced.
            The potential conflict that provoked each stage of proliferation is
            quite different to the one that triggers the next. For instance, the
            Indian bomb, clearly responding to that of China, is now primarily
            understood through the successor stage, in which the nuclear arsenals of
            India and Pakistan are weighed against each other in strategic
            calculations. Similarly, Pakistan’s Islamic bomb (when related to
            India’s Hindu bomb) has to be re-conceived as a <em>Sunni bomb</em> on
            its other face, envisaged from the Greater Middle East, where a Shia
            bomb is the obvious threat-response — the next domino.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to stress that this is where the Iranian nuclear program
            comes from. American and Israeli optics tend to distract from the
            regional logic of proliferation. However politically convenient it may
            be for Iranian leaders to publicly proclaim that their bomb (which, of
            course, they have no intention whatsoever of building) is designed
            solely to kill Jews, or to drive Americans out of the Gulf, it is in
            fact overwhelmingly necessitated by the fact that a Sunni bomb already
            exists, next door. A nuclear Iran means, fundamentally, a balance of
            threat between Sunni and Shia power in the Greater Middle East. It can
            also be assumed, with extreme confidence, that a
            <em>Sunni Arab</em> (Saudi) bomb would soon follow, according to the
            wholly predictable  domino-Janus sequence which exposes Iran from the
            other side.

            Tyler Durden (of <em>Zero Hedge</em>)<a

            some harsh light on <del>the lead up to WWIV</del> recent diplomatic
            engagement between Saudi Arabia and Russia — countries that seem to be
            uniquely serious about the outcome of the Islamic civil(izational) war.
             Roughly a month ago, these countries had a less than complete meeting
            of minds on the future of the region. TD quotes <em>Al-Monitor</em>
            <a
              href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2013/08/saudi-russia-putin-bandar-meeting-syria-egypt.html#ixzz2d5UVLSNv">on</a>
            the conclusion: “At the end of the meeting, the Russian and Saudi sides
            agreed to continue talks, provided that the current meeting remained
            under wraps. This was before one of the two sides leaked it via the
            Russian press.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Since we know all about this, it means no more talks, an implicit
              warning that the Chechens operating in proximity to Sochi may just
              become a loose cannon (with Saudi’s blessing of course), and that
              about a month ago “<strong>there is no escape from the military option, because it is the only
                currently available choice given that the political settlement ended
                in stalemate.</strong>” Four weeks later, we are on the edge of all out war, which may
              involve not only the US and Europe, but most certainly Saudi Arabia
              and Russia which automatically means China as well. Or, as some may
              call it, the world.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Russian leverage is aligned with inertia, so it can be exercised with
            some subtlety. The Saudis, on the other hand, are in an awkward spot:
             they either back down, or they have to make ‘a splash’. Anyone looking
            for upcoming trigger events knows where to pay attention.

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… whatever the Administration has said about the purpose of an attack
              being to “degrade and deter” Syrian capabilities, but not to change
              the regime, everyone expects the attacks to be modest and brief, thus
              not to much affect the battlefield balance, and once ceased to stay
              ceased. That is because the Administration’s reticence at being drawn
              into the bowels of Syrian madness is both well established and well
              justified. The attacks, then, will likely not degrade or deter
              anything really; they will be offered up only as a safety net to catch
              the falling reputation of the President as it drops toward the nether
              regions of strategic oblivion.</em>

          <p>
            This has all been so vividly sign-posted it is getting hard to see how
            even a ‘cosmetic’ effect is going to work. How can an operation
            pre-advertized as an awkward spasm of embarrassment be realistically
            expected to restore honor and credibility?

            Rough Triangles
            <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/islams-civil-war/">analysis</a>
            from William Lind:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>… we think of jihad as something waged by Islam against non-Muslims,
              but quite often it has been between one Islamic sect and another. Now
              Islamists are once again declaring jihad on each other. In June the
              <strong>New York Times</strong> reported on an influential Sunni
              cleric who “has issued a fatwa, or religious decree, calling on
              Muslims around the world to help Syrian rebels… and labeling Hezbollah
              and Iran” — both Shi’ite — “enemies of Islam ‘more infidel than Jews
              and Christians.'” David Gardner’s
              <strong>Financial Times</strong> piece tells of a  “conclave of Sunni
              clerics meeting in Cairo [that] declared a jihad against what it
              called a ‘declaration of war on Islam’ by the ‘Iranian regime,
              Hezbollah and its sectarian allies’.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>How should the West react to all this? With quiet rejoicing. Our
              strategic objective should be to get Islamists to expend their
              energies on each other rather than on us. An old aphorism says the
              problem with Balkans is that they produce more history than they can
              consume locally. Our goal should be to encourage the Muslim world to
              consume all its history — of which it will be producing a good deal —
              as locally as possible. Think of it as “farm to table” war.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>All we should do, or can do, to obtain this objective is to stay out.
              We ought not meddle, no matter how subtly; if we do, inevitably, it
              will blow up in our faces. Just go home, stay home, bolt the doors
              (especially to refugees who will act out their jihads here) …</em>

          </a>
          <p>
            The master jigsaw puzzle piece connecting US domestic and foreign policy
            together is the petrodollar. Federal debt production depends upon
            credibility in the US currency that is anchored by its privileged role
            in global hydrocarbons commerce. Knock out that privilege, and US dollar
            holdings become one speculative asset among others. The fiat house of
            cards begins to tumble (perhaps with shocking rapidity).
          </p>
          <p>
            In this context, US monetary policy begins to look like a side-line of
            ‘friendship’ with the Saudis, which is dissolving into quick sand. Pepe
            Escobar
            <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MID-05-251013.html">at</a>
            AToL explores some of the possible consequences. (It’s especially
            notable that the fracking revolution could accelerate a petrodollar
            crisis, rather than retarding it.) There’s also a China angle, which is
            always fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Disconcertingly for almost everybody, in different ways, the awkward
            retraction of US power from the Middle Eastern wasps’ nest tends
            inevitably to destabilize the global monetary regime. The more the
            Saudis feel jilted, the less their commitment to the petrodollar pact,
            but if this was ever a low-maintenance relationship, it certainly isn’t
            anymore.

            reduce to that yet, but it increasingly looks as if they will.

            that Saudi Arabia is already a virtual nuclear power. In collaboration

            with CSS-2 delivery systems), which is presently distributed according
            to diplomatic convenience, with the war-heads held in Pakistan. Assuming

            Has Obama Administration geostrategy been based upon a cunning (and
            secret) plan? Richard Fernandez
            <a href="http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2014/05/11/the-day-obamas-presidency-died/">makes</a>
            the case that a covert American attempt to subvert radical Islam crested
            with the September 11, 2012, Benghazi fiasco. Employing a mix of
            infiltration, drone assassination (to clear promotion paths), and
            calculated regime sacrifices (Egypt, Syria), the objective was to
            reforge an international Jihad under covert US control. When the
            take-over plan went south, nothing could be publicly admitted. Cascading
            failure has continued in the shadows ever since, jutting into media
            consciousness as a succession of disconnected — even inexplicable —
            foreign policy setbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The curious thing about September 11, 2012 — the day of the Benghazhi
              attack — is that for some reason it marks the decline of the Obama
              presidency as clearly as a milepost. We are told by the papers that
              nothing much happened on that day. A riot in a far-away country. A few
              people killed. And yet … it may be coincidental, but from that day the
              administration’s foreign policy seemed inexplicably hexed. The Arab
              Spring ground to a halt. The secretary of State “resigned.” The CIA
              director was cast out in disgrace. Not long after, Obama had to
              withdraw his red line in Syria. Al-Qaeda, whose eulogy he had
              pronounced, appeared with disturbing force throughout Africa, South
              Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. Almost as if on cue, Russia made an
              unexpected return to the world stage, first in Syria, then in the
              Iranian nuclear negotiations.</em>

            Having seen this a few times now (most recently
            <a href="http://intellectualconservative.com/duly-noted-dont-worry-just-look-the-other-way/">here</a>, where
            it’s
            described as a “five-year plan”), I decided I just had to
            have it.

            The claim that modern Sunni ‘fundamentalism’ (Salafism, Wahhabism)
            <strong>is</strong> the Islamic Reformation is well-established (this
            blog has grazed upon the background
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-part-5/">here</a>). The persistence of this
            proposition
            attests to its significance, and
            is at least suggestive of credibility. It can reasonably be placed
            alongside the Moldbug Ultra-Calvinism
            <a href="http://foseti.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/review-of-unqualified-reservations-part-1/">Thesis</a>

            A fairly recent
            <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2014/07/the-breaking-of-images/">post</a>
            at <em>Patheos</em> by Philip Jenkins (via Henry
            <a href="https://twitter.com/henrydampier">Dampier</a>) presents this
            proposition with remarkable force. Mustering its case in terms of
            <em>iconoclasm</em>, it integrates the phenomenon helpfully, in
            particular by emphasizing the essential unity of militant anti-idolatry
            and mass violence. Smashing idols is no mere intellectual or doctrinal
            position. Iconoclastic militancy is a social operation, which is not
            only instantiated within the history of revolutionary turmoil, but
            occupies a privileged position within it. The revolutionary — or
            ideologically-mobilized — mob is epitomized by iconoclastic irruption,
            which foreshadows its potential for violent abstraction.
            Doctrinally-motivated vandalism, from the European Reformation, through
            the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to the ravages of our
            contemporary radical Islam, is the archetypal form of modern
            revolutionary (com)motion.

            <span id="more-3424"></span><em>For present purposes, it is the Wahhabi tradition that has unleashed
              the savage destruction of shrines and holy places that has been so
              widely deplored in the past half-century or so. This includes the
              Taliban’s destruction of the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the attempted
              eradication of the glorious shrines and libraries of Timbuktu, and the
              annihilation of most of the ancient shrines and tombs around Mecca
              itself. Some Egyptian Islamists fantasize about eradicating all the
              ruins of pagan ancient Egypt, including the Pyramids themselves.</em>

              Modern Westerners are rightly appalled by such acts as desecrations of
              humanity’s cultural heritage. But such outrage demonstrates a
              near-total lack of awareness of the West’s own history. Nothing that
              the Islamists have done in this regard would cause the sixteenth
              century Protestant Reformers to lose a moment’s sleep. They would
              probably have asked to borrow hammers and axes so they could join in.
            </p>
          </em>
          <p>
            <em>I am sometimes bemused to hear Western commentators call for
              contemporary Islam to experience a “Reformation,” by which they mean
              an opening to freedom and toleration. That is of course an extremely
              distorted view of Christianity’s own Reformation. Arguably, Islam has
              been going through its own Reformation for a century or so, which is
              exemplified by the Wahhabis and Salafists. That’s the problem.</em>

            <em>Asabiyyah</em> is an Arabic word for a reason. Unlike many of my
            allies on the extreme right, I see no point at all in other cultures
            attempting to emulate it. The idea of a contemporary Western
            <em>asabiyyah</em> is roughly as probable as the emergence of Arabic
            libertarian capitalism. In any case, ISIS has it now, which means they
            have to keep fighting, and will probably keep winning.
            <em>Asabiyyah</em> is useless for anything but war, and it dissolves
            into dust with peace. The only glories Islam will ever know going
            forward will be found on the battlefield, and it is fully aware of the
            fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baghdad will almost certainly have
            <a
              href="http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2014/10/14/5-key-implications-if-baghdad-falls-to-isis/?singlepage=true">fallen</a>
            by the end of the year, or early next. The Caliphate will then be
            reborn, in an incarnation far more ferocious than the last. Its
            existence will coincide with a war, extending far beyond Mesopotamia and
            the Levant, at least through the Middle East, into the Central Asia and
            the Indian subcontinent, across the Maghreb, and deep into Africa. If
            the Turks are not terrified about what is coming, they have no
            understanding of the situation. This is what the global momentum behind
            militant ‘Islamism’ across recent decades has been about. Realistically,
            it’s unstoppable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, it will bleed out, and then Islam will have done the last
            thing of which it is capable. No less than tens of millions will be
            dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other, industrially-competent and technologically-sophisticated
            civilizations have no cause for existential panic, although
            mega-terrorist attacks could hurt them. Any efforts they make to pacify
            the Caliphate-war will be futile, at best. It is a piece of fate now.
            The future will have to be built around it.

              That doesn’t include embassy personnel, American aid workers, and
              reporters also in Baghdad. ISIS doesn’t have to capture the airport to
              prevent flights from taking off there (remember Hamas rockets from
              Gaza prompting the temporary closure of Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport

              State Department and Pentagon evacuate U.S. personnel? An image like
              the last helicopter out of Saigon would be of considerable propaganda
              value to ISIS and other jihadist groups. Former CNN reporter Peter

            This blog has doubtless generated rafts of unreliable predictions. The
            one that has been nagging, however — ever since Scott Alexander called
            me out on it in the comment thread there — was advanced in the most
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-note-3/">recent</a>
            sub-episode of this series. Quote: “Baghdad will almost certainly have
            <a

            by the end of the year, or early next.” Even if the time horizon for
            this event is stretched out to the end of March 2015, I have very low
            confidence in it being realized. The analysis upon which it was based
            was crucially flawed. I’m getting my crow-eating in early (and even if —
            by some improbably twist of fortune — ISIS is in control of Baghdad by
            late March next year, it won’t be any kind of vindication for the
            narrative I was previously spinning.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Where did I go wrong (in my own eyes)? Fundamentally, by hugely
            over-estimating the intelligence of ISIS. The collapse of this inflated
            opinion is captured by a single word: Kurds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just a few months ago, ISIS enjoyed a strategic situation of
            extraordinary potential. It represented the most militant — and thus
            authentic — strain of Arab Sunni Jihad, ensuring exceptional morale,
            flows of volunteers from across the Sunni Muslim world, and funding from
            the gulf oil-states, based upon impregnable legitimacy. It was able to
            recruit freely from the only constituency within Iraq with any military
            competence — the embittered remnants of Saddam’s armed forces, recycled
            through the insurgency against the American occupation, and then
            profoundly alienated by the sectarian politics of the new Shia regime.
            It was also able to draw upon a large, fanatically motivated, Syrian
            Sunni population, brutalized and hardened by the war against the
            (Alawite, or quasi-Shia) Assad regime in that country. Both enemy states
            were radically anathematized throughout the Sunni world, deeply
            demoralized, incompetent, and patently incapable of asserting their
            authority throughout their respective countries. In consequence, a
            re-integrated insurgent Sunni Mesopotamia had arisen, with such
            historical momentum that it served as a concrete source of inspiration
            for energetic holy war, and a natural base for the
            eschatalogically-promised reborn Caliphate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span id="more-4242"></span>The wider environment was more complicated,
            but also highly encouraging. The Jihadi legitimacy of ISIS made
            opposition from the Sunni Arab states to the south (Jordan, Saudi
            Arabia) unthinkable. That left four major sources of substantial hostile
            intervention: Israel, the United States, Turkey, and Iran. Taking these
            in turn:
          </p>
          <p>
            (1) Israel, by all game-theoretic sanity, was a <em>de facto</em> ally.
            Perhaps it is. It had no intelligible motive for intervention, and were
            it to do so the legitimacy of ISIS would be immediately elevated to
            stratospheric levels. Baghdad or Damascus regimes dependent upon Israeli
            support would be obviously politically unsustainable. (Israeli war
            against ISIS puts it in objective collaboration with Iran — which isn’t
            going to happen.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) The USA was burnt out, directionless, strategically-conflicted to
            the point of psychosis, and politically-toxic to near-Israeli levels.
            Relevant at this point only as a Jihadi recruiting tool.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) As a NATO member, Turkey completes the troika of Westernized states,
            whose intervention would naturally tend to reinforce a
            clash-of-civilizations escalation, to the extreme medium-term advantage
            of ISIS. While a Sunni state, it is not Arab, and would quickly generate
            extraordinary ethnic animosity. With Turks having lost the previous
            Caliphate, there is no imaginable circumstances in which the Sunni
            Muslim world would entertain the prospect of them leading — or even
            seriously interfering with — the next one. Turkish intervention might no
            doubt slow things down, but it could not conceivably stabilize the
            situation in Mesopotamia. The effect would be to rapidly expand the
            conflict into Turkey itself, and even into Turkic Central Asia. There is
            no reason to think Turkish popular opinion would support a strategically
            pointless, bloody war in the south. (We will get to the critical Kurdish
            factor in a moment.)
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) From a strictly military point of view, Iran possesses a mixture of
            capability and commitment that makes it a uniquely formidable opponent,
            but here the political calculus is also at its starkest. From the moment
            it intervenes, the Sunni-Shia sectarian character of the war is
            consolidated, and generalized, into a truly global, climactic struggle
            between the two dominant branches of the Muslim faith. From a local
            (Mesopotamian) uprising, ISIS’s war would be transformed immediately
            into an apocalyptic religious event, setting the world to the torch.
            Jihadi recruitment and funding would become a worldwide deluge. For the
            Iranians, there is no imaginable end-point to this, short of an
            <em>absolute resolution</em> at the level of eschatology, or
            revolutionary world-transformation. ISIS has the base-brain juice for
            that, does Teheran?
          </p>
          <p>
            … but then we get to the Kurds. <em>Of course</em> ISIS should have
            courted them, anything else is utter madness. While not Arabs, they’re
            Sunni. They already hate the Baghdad regime, and long for secession.
            They’re more than willing to be persuaded to fight Turks, Persians, or
            (Alawite) Syrians, if the need arises. Played with even a minimum of
            intelligence, the Kurds would have provided a wedge to break Iraq apart
            definitively, distract the (Baghdad) regime, strip it of oil revenues,
            keep the Turks and Iranians nervous, and even provide various kinds of
            active support as they saw their long-held dreams of an independent
            Kurdistan arising and beckoning like a tantalizing jinn at the edge of
            the new Jihadi Caliphate. It’s the ultimate no-brainer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, ISIS threw everything away fighting the Kurds. It’s an
            organization of idiots, and a whole bunch of its fighters are now
            pointlessly dead idiots. No Baghdad-by-early-2015 for you losers. I’m
            embarrassed to have been drawn out of my dismissive contempt.

              But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill
              me. You have a right to do that … but you have no right to judge me.
              It’s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who
              do not know what horror means. Horror … Horror has a face … and you
              must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your
              friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are
              truly enemies! I remember when I was with Special Forces … seems a
              thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some
              children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for
              polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He
              couldn’t see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off
              every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little
              arms. And I remember … I … I … I cried, I wept like some grandmother.
              I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn’t know what I wanted to do! And
              I want to remember it. I never want to forget it … I never want to
              forget. And then I realized … like I was shot … like I was shot with a
              diamond … a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought,
              my God … the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect,
              genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were
              stronger than we, because they could stand that these were not
              monsters, these were men … trained cadres. These men who fought with
              their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with
              love … but they had the strength … the strength … to do that. If I had
              ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very
              quickly. You have to have men who are moral … and at the same time who
              are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling
              … without passion … without judgment … without judgment! Because it’s
              judgment that defeats us.</em>

              high-definition images. It shows exploding tanks and Islamic State

              “Flames of War” flash on the screen, followed by the words, “Fighting

            <em>Pax Americana</em> is easy to laugh at, but so — no doubt — was
            <em>Pax Britannica</em> and even <em>Pax Romana</em>. Imperial order
            isn’t a tidy or pretty business. It was, however, something, and it’s

            Powerful nonlinear dynamics are triggered at certain critical points of
            systemic transformation. The positive network effects that induced
            powers great and small to buy into a credible world order switch into
            reverse, with every defection making the value of continued adherence
            less convincing to everyone else. In Europe and East Asia the defection
            dominoes have yet to cascade, and the slow work of fundamental
            subversion proceeds at a misleadingly languid pace. In the Middle East,
            in sharp contrast, little remains of the preferred American

            WSJ article. Everything the US is still trying to accomplish in the
            region is pushing it into deeper complicity with the Teheran regime —
            whether on the specific issue of the Iranian nuclear program, operations
            against ISIS, or involvement in Yemen — and this makes it an objective
            antagonist of the Sunni establishment. A deep Sunni
            <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/the-islamic-vortex-part-5/">reformation</a>
            — in the most blood-drenched sense of the word — is unfolding in the
            region, and the US is simply incapable of aligning with it. Yet as
            conflict escalates, and polarization intensifies, even the most
            conservative Sunni players are driven into solidarity with revolutionary
            Jihadi radicalism. If an Iranian-orchestrated campaign, coordinated with
            Iraq’s Maliki regime*, Assad, and the Kurds, succeeds in crushing the

          </a>
          <p>The ‘Daesh’* statement on the attack (in full):</p>
          <p>
            <em>In the name of Allah, the all merciful, the very merciful Allah the
              great said: and they thought in truth that their fortresses would
              defend them against Allah. But Allah came to them from where they
              weren’t expecting it and launched a terror in their hearts. They were
              demolishing their gomes with their own hands as well as from the hands
              of believers. Take a lesson oh you who are wise. Sourat 59, verse 2.
              […] In a blessed attack which Allah facilitated the causes, a group of
              believers from the soldiers of the caliphate to whom Allah has given
              strength and glory targeted the capital of abomination and perversion,
              the one who lifts the banner of the cross in Europe, Paris. […] A
              group divorced from this life taking a step toward their enemy,
              looking for death in Allah’s path, rescuing its religion, its Prophet
              and its allies and wanting to humiliate its enemies. They were true to
              Allah and we consider them as such. Allah acquired from their hands
              and through the fear in the hearts of those encountered on their own
              land. […] Eight brothers carrying explosive belts and assault rifles
              took for target places that were carefully chosen in the heart of the
              capital, in the French stadium during a game between two countries,
              France and Germany, which the imbecile of France [President Hollande]
              was present, the Bataclan, where hundreds were present in a party of
              perversion as well as other targets in the 10th, 11th anf 18th
              districts simultaneously. Paris is shaking in their shoes and its
              streets have become very narrow, the death count of the attack is a
              minimum of 200 and even more injured by the will of Allah. […] Allah
              facilitated our brothers and gave them what they hoped for,
              (martyrdom), they activated their explosive belts in the middle of the
              infidels after they ran out of ammunition. May Allah welcome them
              among the martyrs and allow us to meet them. And France and those who
              follow its way must know that there are still principle targets left
              for the Islamic State and that they [France] will continue to smell
              death for having taken the lead in the crusade [in Syria] after having
              insulted our Prophet, after they’ve flaunted their fight against Islam
              in France, and beaten our Muslim brothers in Caliphate land with their
              planes that were useless in the smelly streets of Paris. This attack
              is only the beginning of the storm and a warning for those who want to
              ponder and learn a lesson. […] Allah is great, the strength belongs to
              Allah and His messenger and believers, but the hypocrites do not know
              it. Sourat 63, verse 8.</em>

            It’s an over-used formula, but this time it really does seem
            appropriate. If
            <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/20/syria-assad-isis-paris-russia/">this</a>
            analysis can be trusted — and it looks at least superficially plausible
            — ISIS has broken the soul of evangelical democratization. Once the
            Cathedral’s universalistic faith has been defeated (“the freedom agenda
            in the Muslim world is dead”), how long can it be before the gathering
            ebb tide tears apart its internal ideological structure? “This is
            something only for us” requires an ‘us’ — and that acknowledgement marks
            the cresting of a crisis that has been centuries — if not millennia — in
            the making.

            <em>Syria represents the culmination of this trend. The moderate rebels
              of 2011 stood no chance of survival against the hard liners who
              managed to rapidly mobilize foreign fighters and take over the
              majority of the insurgency. The result is that, post-Paris, Western
              capitals will be skeptical of regime change of any sort. It will be
              clear that when intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign
              (albeit repressive) states becomes a vehicle for democratic change,
              that vehicle will probably be hijacked by radical Islamists, and will
              arrive at a substantially worse political destination than
              intended.</em>

          <em> </em>
          <p>
            <em>The post-Paris war on terror will affirm the West’s commitment to
              fighting radical Islamic terrorism, but, in the process, it will
              reject the idiom of revolutionary, moralizing democratic change
              inherited from President Bush. Syria was the end of the line for that
              approach.</em>

            The revolution has come right back around to Hobbes, and thus to the
            systematically-cynical origin of the modern state system, the author
            (Emile Simpson) argues. What a long strange trip it’s been.

            <em>So, Islam was established as a polygynous system, meaning it created
              a wife shortage among believers. But raiding non-believers who do not
              submit to Muslim rule was sanctified and taking their women for your
              sexual use was also sanctified. So, sexual frustration generated by
              <strong>Sharia</strong> marriage rules was then explicitly directed
              outwards towards the non-believers who have not submitted to Muslim
              rule. The <strong>ghazis</strong> raiding across the frontier into
              “the lands of unbelief” which were such a feature of the borders of
              Islam for over a millennia represented Islam sanctifying (and so
              intensifying) patterns of typical of polygyny; polygyny that it also
              sanctified.</em>

            Robin Wright (in <em>The New Yorker</em>)
            <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/arab-spring-became-arab-cataclysm">expresses</a>
            the frustrations of a modern Jacobin about as straightforwardly as one
            could hope:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What seems to have been lost in the past five years is American
              strategic support for the Arab Spring’s aspirations — and for the
              innumerable other Bouazizis still struggling for rights and justice
              and jobs. One of Obama’s boldest decisions, in 2011, was to abandon
              longstanding U.S. support for Arab despots, personified in President
              Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt ruthlessly for thirty years. For the
              first time, Washington opted for the unknowns of potential democracy
              over the guarantees of autocratic stability in the Arab world.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            A speaker for HRW is even clearer about the ideological lineage at stake
            (and it isn’t anything coming out of the Middle East):
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Each local crisis has been complicated by regional players who have
              intervened to block a new Arab order. “It’s no longer about what
              Egyptians want. Or what the Syrian people want,” Whitson, of Human
              Rights Watch, explained. “It’s so much broader and wider — and more
              complicated than during the French Revolution. Now a revolutionary
              doesn’t just fight the bureaucrats in the capital but bureaucrats
              thousands of miles away. There are so many horses in the game who have
              the resources and power to dictate or sway the outcome. It’s a much
              more difficult battle.” […] Speaking of the idealistic protesters of
              five years ago, Whitson said, “Sometimes it makes you wonder if they
              ever had a chance.” Yet she remains sanguine about the future. “The
              fight is not over,” she told me. “Because it can’t be over. The
              aspirations that inspired the spark over a seven-dollar bribe are
              universal, and we know it. As long as governments deny people basic
              justice and dignity, people will rise up.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, “rise up” [*facepalm*]. If there’s any distinction at all between
            (subjective) ‘caring’ and (objective) raw evil it’s getting ever harder
            to discern. The bleeding-out of universalistic Cathedral evangelism in
            the Middle East has been an event of far greater consequence than anyone
            is yet able to acknowledge.

            <em>One man who understood the power of “Salafi jihadism” was Saddam
              Hussein, who according to
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/how-saddam-hussein-gave-us-isis.html?_r=0">Kyle Orton,
                writing in the New York Times</a>, understood long before Obama that secular socialism was no match
              for a full-bore jihadism which had endured the test of centuries. “The
              Arab nationalist Baath Party, which seized power in 1968 in a coup in
              which Mr. Hussein played a key role, had a firmly secular outlook.
              This held through the 1970s, even as religiosity rose among the Iraqi
              people. But soon after Mr. Hussein invaded Iran in 1980, it began to
              change.”</em>
          </p>
          <em> </em>
          <p>
            <em>To compensate for his shortcomings in governance, Saddam covered
              himself with the Koran. He also tried what Obama later attempted, an
              alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, with disastrous results. Rather
              than beating Islam, the Baath began to be absorbed by it. “In 1986,
              however, the Pan-Arab Command, the Baath Party’s top ideological
              institution, formally reoriented Iraq’s foreign policy toward an
              alliance with Islamists. This was the first clear deviation from
              secular Baathism.”</em>

            According to the geo-economic logic of the dying <em>status quo</em>,
            the Islamic Vortex supported oil prices by injecting menace into the
            supply chain. Peaks of turbulence were associated with oil

            peace initiatives’ (or more drastic interventions) were so deeply
            entwined with oil supply security imperatives as to be scarcely
            distinguishable.

            <em>Many energy analysts became convinced that Doha would prove the
              decisive moment when Riyadh … would agree to a formula allowing Iran
              some [production] increase before a freeze. … But then something
              happened. According to people familiar with the sequence of events,
              Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince and key oil strategist, Mohammed
              bin Salman,
              <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/260c2300-0559-11e6-a70d-4e39ac32c284.html">called</a>
              the Saudi delegation in Doha at 3:00 a.m. on April 17th and instructed
              them to spurn a deal that provided leeway of any sort for Iran. When
              the Iranians — who chose not to attend the meeting — signaled that
              they had no intention of freezing their output to satisfy their
              rivals, the Saudis rejected the draft agreement it had helped
              negotiate and the assembly ended in disarray. […] … Most analysts have
              since suggested that the Saudi royals simply considered punishing Iran
              <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-meeting-kemp-idUSKCN0XF2AR">more important</a>
              than raising oil prices. No matter the cost to them, in other words,
              they could not bring themselves to help Iran pursue its geopolitical
              objectives, including giving yet more support to Shiite forces in
              Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon. Already feeling pressured by Tehran
              and ever less confident of Washington’s support, they were ready to
              use any means available to weaken the Iranians, whatever the danger to
              themselves.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            With ‘Peak oil <em>demand</em>‘ in prospect, and a brutal zero-sum
            struggle beginning for shares in a market tending to secular shrinkage,
            the deepening Sunni-Shia has become an engine of systematic oil price
            suppression. According to plausible Saudi calculations, the Iranian
            enemy will simply use oil revenues to pursue their geopolitical
            objectives more competently than the Saudis can themselves. A higher oil
            price, therefore, is comparatively advantageous to the Shia bloc (at
            least in the eyes of the Saudis, whose perceptions in this regard
            uniquely matter, due to their status as sole
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_producer">swing</a>-producer). Any rise in revenues is
            overwhelmed
            by
            the quantity of
            additional military challenge it brings with it. This holds true
            <em>whatever the level of social stress a low price inflicts on the Sunni
              side</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s quite a box the Saudis find themselves in. There’s no way out of it
            that doesn’t require winning a religious war.

            <em>“They say all Sunnis are Daesh, but it isn’t true,” said former truck
              driver Jassem Nouri, 50. Nouri has spent the past two years living on
              a building site in the northeast of Salahuddin province; his home, in
              the Sunni village of Salman Beg, is just six miles away, but the
              Shiite militias that ejected the Islamic State from the area over two
              years ago have refused to allow any of the residents to return. Last
              year, his two sons, former university students, were detained by
              masked men in unmarked uniforms and accused of working with the
              Islamic State. Nouri insists that they are innocent, but he has not
              been able to secure their release. […] “The one thing that is breaking
              my heart is that my sons are in jail and I can’t prove their
              innocence,” he said. “If this government doesn’t change, there will
              never be security and stability in Iraq, just an endless blind
              revenge.”</em>

            No one has the slightest (realistic) idea what equilibrium would even

            has to be the basic principle of strategic wisdom.

            <em>Oceans of ink have been spilt on the attempt to estimate the true
              extent of the threat of Islam to the West, and the attempts range from
              the frankly paranoid to the most supinely complacent. For myself, I
              veer constantly between the two, hardly pausing in between. In the
              last analysis, the West has all the cards, intellectual and military;
              but if it refuses ever to play them, they are of no account.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If Islam destroys the West, it will only be in the role of a suicide
            weapon, deployed by the West against itself. The basis of the
            Apocalyptic case is that the West has been taught, very successfully,
            that it does not <em>deserve</em> continued existence. (“Better dead

            It’s a clear sign of how seriously Radical Islam is taken by the foreign
            policy establishments of civilized states. Roughly, it’s treated as a
            biological weapon, to be used against <em>real</em> adversaries (you
            know, those who are not mere <em>hill people</em>). That’s not going to
            change much anytime soon, however much one might want it to.

            This is not — of course — conclusive. It would be a stretch to say that
            it isn’t suggestive. As far as practical politics are concerned, current
            leftist priorities look strikingly self-contradicting. Islamization or
            popular sovereignty — choose one (or less).

        the politics of amnesty by executive order:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For many liberal Democrats (as well as for some of their Republican
          opponents) two key beliefs about immigration shape their political
          strategies. The first is that Latinos are the new blacks: a permanent
          racial minority or subgroup in the American political system that will
          always feel separate from the country’s white population and, like
          African-Americans, will vote Democratic. On this assumption, the
          Democratic approach to Hispanic Americans should be clear: the more
          the merrier. That is a particularly popular view on the more leftish
          side of the Democratic coalition, where there’s a deep and instinctive
          fear and loathing of Jacksonian America (those “bitterly clinging” to
          their guns, their Bibles, and their individualistic economic and
          social beliefs). The great shining hope of the American left is that a
          demographic transition through immigration and birthrates will finally
          make all those tiresome white people largely irrelevant in a new,
          post-American America that will forget all that exceptionalism
          nonsense and ditch “Anglo-Saxon” cultural and economic ideas ranging
          from evangelical religion to libertarian social theory.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If conventional wisdom on the subject is this stark — and Mead is a good
        weather-vane for that — then Obama might as well put on the
        <strong>Kill Whitey</strong> T-shirt, because he’s clearly not fooling
        anybody. (It’s also worth explicitly noting, for the anti-market trads
        out there, that your besieged cultural norms and
        <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism are on the same radical leftist death
        list, whether you appreciate the company or not.)

    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        It would be hard to find a clearer illustration of the topic than
        <a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/american-orientalism">this</a>
        article (written from the vehemently discrimination-negative left). The
        stakes are so clear that detailed commentary is entirely otiose. Some
        snippets:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The contrast was stark. One group of South Asians had become objects
          of fear and derision and targets of immigration enforcement and
          extra-legal violence. Another group of South Asians was being heralded
          for their social, economic, and cultural contributions to the United
          States. … the complexities that lay beneath the surface of “South
          Asian” identity were flattened into a powerful binary; South Asian
          Americans were either model minorities or national threats. … But this
          was not merely a post–9/11 phenomenon. In fact, the division between
          the feared and the desired, the denigrated and the celebrated, has
          been a defining feature of South Asian racialization in the United
          States for over one hundred years. … for decades, federal immigration
          laws and popular culture have worked together to make these
          distinctions, to distinguish desirable from undesirable South Asians.
          … Between 1904 and 1917 … xenophobia and Indophilia were not simply
          contradictory attitudes that played out in two separate social spheres
          — that is, South Asians were not simply denigrated in political
          debates over immigration restriction while they were simultaneously
          celebrated in popular culture. Instead, each sphere generated its own
          set of distinctions between who was desirable and who was not, and
          each set of distinctions reinforced the other. … the 1882 Chinese
          Exclusion Act, the 1885 Alien Contract Labor Law, and the 1917
          Immigration Act were never straightforward acts of Asian exclusion,
          nor was the 1965 Hart-Cellar Immigration Act — the law that is
          credited with ending the exclusion era — an act that fully “opened the
          door” to Asian immigration. All four of these Acts — in effect and in
          intent — helped define who within Asian populations was welcome and
          who was not. … the so-called exclusion laws introduced a logic that
          certain South Asians were admissible — or desirable — because of their
          class, education, and profession. This was ultimately the logic
          enshrined in the “occupational preferences” provisions of the 1965
          Immigration Act; the legislation brought thousands of South Asian
          doctors, engineers, and other professionals to the United States in
          the 1970s and 1980s, while keeping working-class migration to a
          minimum. … Orientalism is a double-edged set of ideas, standards, and
          expectations. In the realms of both immigration law and popular
          culture, the desired and the denigrated have always been inextricably
          linked; they are defined in relation to one another, with a line drawn
          between them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As with most leftist tirades, the effect of this discussion is to
        engender appreciation for those few fraying fibers of sound public
        policy and cultural discernment that might otherwise be overlooked. I’m
        willing to grant the possible advantages of
        <em>further, more minute discrimination</em>. The fact that
        discrimination is occurring at all, however, is an indication that —
        even in this advanced stage of Cathedral dominion — sanity is not
        altogether dead.

    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Arguments that indiscriminate immigration is socially beneficial are too
        widespread to pick upon in detail — spend any time over at
        <em>The Economist</em> or, for the full-throttle ‘altruistic’ version,
        Bryan Caplan’s place, to be inundated in them. It’s hard to see how a
        lack of selectivity could ever be advantageous from the perspective of
        the demographic recipient, but the whole discussion evades a far more
        toxic problem. If a case for the mass implantation of unscreened foreign
        populations is couched in the language of self-interest — however
        misguidedly — it can, at least potentially, be engaged rather than
        merely diagnosed. (This blog has no problem with immigration
        <em>in general</em> whatsoever.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Far more disturbing to any surviving assumptions about sane social
        policy decisions is the very different argument (exemplified by the
        Cathedral-crazed second questioner in
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpDGo1Dtb8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this</a>
        clip (<a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertBrenner1">via</a>)) that
        immigration is a punishment to be embraced, in a form of
        religiously-intoxicated, collective self-flagellation, to scourge the
        sin-blackened Occident, unendingly, for its ineliminable historical
        crimes. This is ethnomasochism in its purest instantiation, and argument
        is wholly irrelevant against it. Such moral-religious convulsants do not
        want ‘good’ (productive, orderly, talented, aspirational) immigration.
        They want the lash. No ‘racist’ profile of potential immigrant groups
        can be vicious enough to elicit aversion, on the contrary — the more
        harm that is promised by the incomers, the more sobbing gratitude
        accompanies the invitation. Immigration is <em>meant to be torture</em>,
        so what use are brainy, well-behaved entrepreneurs? The ideal immigrant
        in this vision of infinitized moral purgation is not a social asset, but
        a wretched, dysfunctional parasite, or better still an arrogant,
        contemptuous aggressor. ‘Model minorities’ are erased from the picture
        entirely, because they do not exact the suffering that is so ardently
        desired. (“You can wander through Chinatown late at night without being
        robbed, beaten, or raped — what’s the possible spiritual value in
        that?”) To repeat the essential, and hideously consequential point:
        <em>Immigration is supposed to punish us</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the terminal pathology of Western Civilization, in its ‘highest’
        state of expression. There is not much that can be said to be fortunate
        about it, except that it cannot be indefinitely prolonged.

          because it’s seen as racist. For example, during the peak of adulation

        How would one even begin to argue with anything said here? There’s a lot

        It would be a relief to see Merkel awarded the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize

        its traditionally-favored fascist ‘solution’. Quite probably, it will
        get to lose another World War before the complete extinction of its
        civilization.

        <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/billion-immigrants-change-american-polity/">Hints</a>
        of queasiness from open borders advocate Nathan Smith:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A couple of years ago, I wrote a post called “<a
            href="http://openborders.info/blog/the-american-polity-can-endure-and-flourish-with-open-borders/">The
            American Polity Can Endure and Flourish Under Open Borders</a>.” I would not write that post today. The
          American polity might
          endure and flourish under open borders, but I wouldn’t claim that
          confidently. What changed my mind? A greater familiarity with the
          theoretical models that are the basis for “<a href="http://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/">double world
            GDP</a>” as a claim about the global economic impact of open borders,
          especially
          <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2589733">my own</a>. It turns out that these
          estimates depend on billions of people
          migrating internationally under open borders. … I do not think the US
          polity is robust enough to absorb 1 billion immigrants (even, say,
          over the course of fifty years) and retain its basic political
          character and structure.</em>

        The large, link-dense text that follows is sure to stir up some
        excitement among border-stripping libertarians. As a political science
        fiction scenario, it has much to recommend it (including some
        fragmentation features that the Outer Right might find suprisingly
        appealing).

      </p>
      <p>Whatever it is that’s happening here should be over fairly quickly.</p>
      <p>
        Also worth noting: “The authorities’ report also cited concerns that
        those who are granted asylum will bring their families over to Germany
        too, Bild said. […] Given family structures in the Middle East, this
        would mean each individual from that region who is granted asylum
        bringing an average of four to eight family members over to Germany in
        due course, Bild quoted the report as saying.” (So we can crank the
        binary exponent up by another 2-3 notches straight away.)

        Realistically, economic opportunity on a new frontier is likely to
        predominate as the driver for geopolitical disintegration, but “Where do
        I have to go to get away from these people?” is worth carving on the
        gate of an Exit-based polity. It’s
        <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535108/">Elysium</a></em>, and probably the right-most impulse of the
        present world order. The
        Cathedral basically coincides with the answer: <em>Nowhere</em>. It’s
        not an allowable incentive. Still, it’s already a huge incentive (in
        fact), and every week it gets more huge.

        If you were trying to discredit a demographic policy that discriminated

        Shanghai’s 2010 World Expo included an entire pavilion dedicated to
        urban futures. Among the exhibits was a looping video on a large screen,
        depicting varieties of futuristic city-types as speculative animations,
        light-heartedly, and with obvious orientation to youngsters. Since
        children are the denizens of the future, it makes sense to treat them as
        the target audience for a vision of tomorrow’s world, but the effect was
        also disconcerting, as if parenthesizing what was shown in a form of
        deniable, non-abrasive irony.
        <em>This is what the future used to look like</em>. Does it still? On
        this point, a subtle reserve concealed itself as a concession to
        childish credibility, or even inconsequential fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the four future cities on display had been constructed
        off-planet, in earth-orbit. It was populated by happy humans (or, at
        least, humanoids). No date was predicted. Untethered from firm
        futuristic commitment, it intersected adult perception as a fragment of
        cross-cultural memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Imagine a city in space, as a child might</em>. Given the strategic
        obscurity of this statement, when encountered at a carefully-crafted
        international event, in a sophisticated, cosmopolitan, global, Chinese
        city, in 2010, it is tempting to approach it through analogy. Half a
        century ago, when Western children were encouraged to imagine such
        things, during the twilight decades of modernity (1.0), was a sincere
        promise being made to them that they would inherit the solar system? If
        so, is such a promise now being humorously referenced, or is it being
        re-directed, and re-made?
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2010 Expo had a Space Pavilion, too, which only deepened the
        perplexity. Given the opportunity to re-activate Expo traditions of
        techno-industrial grandiosity, it was a spectacular miss-launch,
        containing almost nothing in the way of monumental hardware. The content
        fell into two broad categories: video-based immersive special effects
        (highly-appreciated by kids), and vanilla-domestic applications of space
        technology, on the approximate model of NASA’s lamentable “we’re the
        guys who brought you the non-stick frying-pan” PR campaign. Anybody
        hoping for soul-crushing cyclopean military-analog launch vehicles and
        the acrid stink of rocket fuel had clearly wandered into the wrong
        century. Contemporary international etiquette prevailed, and according
        to that, the business of blazing into orbit is far too crude – even
        <em>primitive</em> — to be vigorously publicized.
      </p>
      <p>
        So even in China, at least in its 2010 window to the world, off-planet
        aspirations were stirred together indissolubly with childhood fantasy.
        The unmistakable insinuation, harmonized with the commanding heights of
        world opinion, was that such hard SF dreams had been outgrown. Rather
        than staring through a window into the spark-torched clangorous workshop
        of China’s emerging national space program, Western visitors found their
        gazes bounced from mirrored glass, into a ‘postmodern’ vacuum of
        collapsed expectations, amongst the eroded ruins of Apollo. Four decades
        of Occidental space failure smiled politely back.
        <em>You lost it, didn’t you</em>? (A quick trip across the Huangpu to
        the drearily mundane USA Pavilion sufficed for unambiguous
        confirmation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The dismissal of a human off-planet future as a childish dream has
        plenty to build upon. The world’s publishers and book shops have long
        accommodated their classification systems to the sleazy ambiguity of the
        ‘science fiction / fantasy genre’, in which futurism smears into
        oneirism, and the vestiges of hard SF
        <em>programs</em> (telecommunication satellites, moon bases, space
        elevators…) are scattered amongst fantastic elves-in-space mythologies
        (from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>Avatar</em>). Competitive prophecies
        decay into polemical allegories, making statements about anything and
        everything <em>except</em> the shape of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of all the cultural ripples from the truncation of the Apollo-era space
        trajectory, none is more telling than the rising popularity of ‘Moon
        Hoax’
        <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html" target="_blank">conspiracy theorizing</a>. Not satisfied with
        the <em>prospective</em> evacuation of the
        heavens, the moon hoaxers began systematically editing space-travelers
        out of the past, beginning with the lunar landings. Whilst clearly
        maddening to space technologists, American patriots, NASA supporters,
        and sensible types in general, this form of ‘denialism’ is not only
        historically comprehensible, but even inevitable. If nobody seriously
        contests the fact that Columbus reached the New World, it is at least in
        part because what was then started kept happening. Something began, and
        continued. Nothing comparable can be said about the process of lunar
        colonization, and that, in itself, is a provocative oddity. When
        forecasts are remembered, abandoned outcomes can be expected to mess up
        memories.

        Old-school space enthusiast Sylvia Engdahl
        <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2125/1" target="_blank">finds</a>
        the whole situation pathological, and subjects it to a kind of
        jerry-built psychoanalysis. With defiant optimism, she attributes “the
        present hiatus in space travel” to xenophobic trauma:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Much is said about the positive effect of the photos of Earth
            obtained by Apollo 8, which for the first time showed our planet as
            a globe, a fragile refuge amid barren surroundings, and thereby
            launched the environmental movement. The concomitant negative impact
            — the spread of gut-level knowledge that space is an actual place
            containing little that’s familiar to us and perhaps much that we’d
            rather not meet — is not spoken of. But it may be no less
            significant. Could this be one of the reasons why interest in space
            died so soon after the first Moon landing, resulting in the
            cancellation of the last few planned Apollo missions?</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>She elaborates:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Most people do not want to contemplate the significance of an open
            universe. They do not let uneasiness about it into their minds, but
            underneath, as the collective unconscious of humankind absorbs the
            knowledge, they grasp it, and react with dismay disguised as apathy.
            It does not occur to them that they might be disturbed by the
            prospect of space exploration. Rather, they believe that although in
            theory they want humankind to reach new worlds, it’s of low priority
            compared to the problems of here and now. … [T]he widespread
            conviction that the public no longer cares about space may also be a
            rationalization.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Engdahl hints at a modern variant of the Orpheus myth, and captures
        something of arresting significance. We were told not to look back from
        orbit, but of course, we did, and what we saw pulled us back down. The
        damnation of our extraterrestrial out-leap gave birth to a lucid
        environmentalist vision — the earth seen from space. That is why Tom
        Murphy
        <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/why-not-space/" target="_blank">turns</a>

        Michael Greer, to
        <a href="https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz/2011/08/elegy-for-age-of-space.html"
          target="_blank">transmute</a>
        elegiac disillusionment into acceptance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>The orbiters are silent now, waiting for the last awkward journey
            that will take them to the museums that will warehouse the grandest
            of our civilization’s failed dreams. There will be no countdown, no
            pillar of flame to punch them through the atmosphere and send them
            whipping around the planet at orbital speeds. All of that is over.
            …In the final analysis, space travel was simply the furthest and
            most characteristic offshoot of industrial civilization, and
            depended — as all of industrial civilization depends — on vast
            quantities of cheap, highly concentrated, readily accessible energy.
            That basic condition is coming to an end around us right now.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Disillusionment is simply awakening from childish things, the druids
        tell us. This is a point Murphy is keen to endorse: “space fantasies can
        prevent us from tackling mundane problems.” Intriguingly, his initial
        step towards acceptance involves a rectification of false memory,
        through a (sane) analog of ‘Moon Hoax’ denial. Surveying his students on
        their understanding of recent space history (“since 1980 or so”), he
        discovered that no less than 52% thought humans had departed the earth
        as far as the moon in that time (385,000 km distant). Only 11% correctly
        understood that no manned expedition had escaped Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
        since the end of the Apollo program (600 km out). Recent human space
        activity, at least in the way it was imagined, had not taken place. It
        was predominantly a collective hallucination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murphy’s highly-developed style of numerate druidism represents the null
        hypothesis in the space settlement debate: perhaps we’re not out there
        because there’s no convincing reason to expect anything else.
        Extraterrestrial space isn’t a frontier, even a tough one, but rather an
        implacably hostile desolation that promises nothing except grief and
        waste. There’s some scientific data to be gleaned, and also (although
        Murphy doesn’t emphasize this) opportunities for political theatrics.
        Other than that, however, there’s nothing beyond LEO worth reaching for.

        The neo-druidic starting point is unapologetically down to earth. It
        <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/07/can-economic-growth-last/" target="_blank">begins</a>
        with energy physics, and the remorseless fact that doing just about
        anything heats things up. According to Murphy’s calculations, a modest
        2.3% global economic growth rate suffices to bring the planetary surface
        to the boiling point of water within four centuries, even in the
        complete absence of (positive) greenhouse effects. Economic growth is
        essentially exponential, and that guarantees that we’re cooked, due to
        elementary thermodynamic principles, efficiency limits, and the
        geophysics of heat dissipation. Within this big picture, conventional
        ‘energy crisis’ concerns are no more than complicating details, although
        Murphy engages them thoroughly. (He provides a neat summary of his
        argument, with internal links,
        <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/02/my-great-hope-for-the-future/" target="_blank">here</a>.)

      <p>
        From the neo-druidic perspective, the space ‘frontier’ is a horizon of
        sheer escapism, attracting those who stubbornly deny the necessity of
        limitation (pestilential growth-addicts):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>…relying on space to provide an infinite resource base into which
            we grow/expand forever is misguided. Not only is it much harder than
            many people appreciate, but it represents a distraction to the
            message that growth cannot continue on Earth and we should get busy
            planning a transition to a non-growth-based, truly sustainable
            existence.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Since plenty of irrepressible growth-mongers
        <a href="http://www.transterrestrial.com/" target="_blank">seriously</a>
        <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/a-space-program-for-the-rest-of-us" target="_blank">want</a>
        to get out there, Murphy trowels on the discouragement in thick, viscous
        layers. Most of the deterrent factors are relatively familiar, but none
        of them are frivolous, or easily dismissed. The principal problem is the
        most qualitative (and druidic): human adaptation to terrestrial
        conditions. This is strikingly illuminated by a consideration of
        terrestrial ‘frontier’ environments that remain almost entirely
        unexploited, despite environmental features that are overwhelmingly more
        benign than anything to be found off-planet. When compared to any
        conceivable space station, asteroid mining camp, lunar base, or Mars
        colony, even the most ‘difficult’ places on earth — the seabed, for
        instance, or the Antarctic — are characterized by extreme hospitability,
        with ready access to breathable air, nutrients, fuels, and other
        essential resources, a moderate temperature range, protection from
        cosmic radiation, and proximity to existing human settlements. This is
        to be contrasted with typical extraterrestrial conditions of hard
        vacuum, utter exposure, complete absence of bio-compatible chemistry,
        and mind-jarring distances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murphy touched upon these distances in his survey of student space
        ignorance. If earth is represented by a “standard” 30-centimeter globe,
        LEO is 1.5 centimeters from the surface, and the moon a full 9 meters
        further out. For intuitive purchase upon more expansive space visions,
        however, a re-calibration is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        It makes sense to model the earth as a small apple (8.5 cm in diameter),
        because then an astronomical unit (AU, the mean earth-sun distance of
        roughly 150 million kilometers, 93 million miles, or 500 light seconds)
        shrinks to a kilometer, with the sun represented by a sphere a little
        over 10 meters in diameter. The moon now lies less than 2.7 meters out
        from our toy earth, but Mars is never less than 400 meters away, the
        nearest asteroids a kilometer away. The distance to the edge of the
        planetary solar system (Neptune) is at least 29 kilometers, and within
        this spatial volume (a sphere of roughly 113,400 AU³), less than one
        part in 27 billion is anything other than desolate vacuum, with almost
        all the rest being solar furnace. On the toy scale, the outer edge of
        the solar system, and the Oort cloud, lies 50,000 kilometers from the
        earth. The distance from our shriveled apple to the nearest star,
        Proxima Centauri, is 277,600 toy kilometers (or 41.5 trillion real
        ones).
      </p>
      <p>
        If space colonization is being construed as an escape from terrestrial
        resource constraints, then a pattern of activity needs to be knitted
        across these distances, producing — at a minimum — an energy surplus. In
        a non-frictional kinetic system, governed almost purely by (macroscopic)
        conservation of momentum, the basic currency of space activity is
        ‘delta-v’, or the transformation of velocity. Delta-v is broadly
        proportional to energy expenditure on “small burns”, when fuel
        consumption makes a negligible difference to total propelled mass, but
        when complete flights or “large burns” are calculated, the math
        <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/stranded-resources/#more-470" target="_blank">becomes</a>
        nonlinear, since the reduction of fuel payload becomes a critical factor
        in the equation (subtracting inertial resistance as it adds motive
        force). In practical terms, the prospective off-planet (‘space-faring’)
        energy economy consists of the consumption of propellant to move
        propellant about, with non-fuel vehicle mass contributing little more
        than a rounding error in the calculations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Somewhat counter-intuitively, it is possible to get the rocket
            moving faster than the exhaust velocity once the fuel mass exceeds
            63% of the total initial mass. In order to get delta-v values in the
            20 km/s range when the exhaust velocity is less than 5 km/s requires
            almost nothing </em>but<em>
            fuel. …[T]he large delta-v’s required to get around the solar system
            require a </em>lot<em> of fuel…</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This double-registry of fuel within the nonlinear equations of “rocket
        math” – as payload and propellant – is the key to Murphy’s deep
        skepticism about the viability of off-planet energy economics. The fuel
        resources strewn within the inner solar system – even assuming their
        absolute abundance – cannot be moved around usefully for less energy
        than they provide. Jupiter offers the most tantalizing example. This
        methane-rich gas giant might be superficially apprehended as an immense
        cosmic fuel depot, but even the most generous calculations of delta-v
        requirements for a Jupiter ‘tanker-run’ imply energy expenditures at
        least an order of magnitude higher than energy obtained – from the
        ‘scooping’ operation alone. The inner solar-system is abundant in
        “stranded resources” that cannot conceivably be extracted at a cost
        lower than their value. That, at least, is the coherent neo-druidic
        perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        …and yet, in the yawning void, where the space settlements were meant to
        have been, the stirrings have not ceased. There even seems to be,
        unmistakably, a quickening of pace. Chinese ‘<a href="http://www.americaspace.org/?p=22881"

        Fascism makes our heads spin, which is unfortunate, because an inability
        to gaze unwaveringly into the dominant ‘third way’ model of political
        economy (corporate nationalism) makes the history of the last century
        unintelligible. For amateur space historians, dropping in briefly on the
        <a href="http://collider.com/iron-sky-us-distribution/145824/" target="_blank">Moon Nazis</a>
        is simply unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        SS Sturmbannführer Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for
        Planning at NASA Headquarters, Washington DC (1970-2), helps with the
        introduction. Technical director of the Nazi rocket program at
        Peenemünde, which culminated in the creation of the A-4 (V-2) ballistic
        missile, von Braun was brought to America in 1945 as the top prize of
        Operation Paperclip. His contribution to US rocket development, through
        Redstone to Apollo (and the moon), was central and indispensable. NASA
        Socialism was born on the
        <a href="http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev493.htm" target="_blank">Dark Side of the Moon</a>. (This

        <a href="http://gravitys-rainbow.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">Pynchon
          territory</a>, but, roughly speaking, that’s where we are.)

        If fascism sounds unduly harsh, more comfortable terminology lies within
        easy reach. ‘Technocracy’ will do fine. The name is less important than
        the essentials, which were already clearly formulated in the work of a
        previous German immigrant to the United States,
        <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1993/12/how-the-world-works/305854/"
          target="_blank">Friedrich List</a>, who devoted an influential book to outlining
        <em>The National System of Political Economy</em> (1841). According to
        List, the ‘cosmopolitanism’ of mainstream (Smithean) political economy
        was insufficiently attentive to the collective national interest.
        Industrial development was too important to be surrendered to the
        interplay of private economic agents, and should instead be considered a
        strategic imperative, within the context of international competition.
        Only by leveraging the power of the state to regulate trade, foster
        modern industries, and drive the development of critical infrastructure,
        could a country hope to advance its interests in the international
        arena. Development was war by other means, and sometimes the same ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        When eagerly embraced by Henry Clay, who connected List’s ideas with the
        founding tradition from Alexander Hamilton, these ideas became the basis
        of the American System. Economic nationalism was to be pursued along the
        threefold path of managed trade (tariffs), state-controlled finance
        (central banking), and state-directed infrastructure development
        (especially transportation systems). Such policies were already
        ‘progressive’ or <del>fascist</del> technocratic in that they
        subordinated private-cosmopolitan economic interests to national
        purposes, but this took place flexibly, without the more recent
        encrustations of anti-business class warfare, large-scale entitlement
        spending, or Cathedralist cultural policing. Capitalism was to be
        steered, and even promoted, rather than milked, deliberately ruined, or
        replaced. Due to its patriotic direction, elitism, and affinity with
        militarization, this technocratic progressivism could easily be
        understood as a phenomenon of ‘the right’, or at least (in Walter
        Russell Mead’s
        <a href="http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2011/12/06/the-age-of-hamilton/" target="_blank">words</a>)
        the “Bipartisan Establishment.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Apollo perfectly exemplified American technocratic progressivism in the
        teutonized, neo-Hamiltonian tradition. A small step for a man, and a
        substantial leap for mankind, it was a colossal high-jump for the US
        Leviathan, marking an unambiguous triumph in the structured competition
        with its principal geo-strategic and ideological rival. The Apollo
        program wasn’t <em>exactly</em> part of the ballistic missile arms race
        with the Soviet Union, but it was close enough to contribute to its
        symbolic, mass-psychological, and deterrent purpose. Landing a man on
        the moon was a type of overkill, relative to landing a nuke on Moscow,
        and it expressed a super-abundant payload-delivery capability that had
        won a war of messages.

        In an article originally published in The American Spectator (November
        10, 2010), Iain Murray and Rand Simberg
        <a href="http://cei.org/op-eds-articles/big-governments-final-frontier" target="_blank">describe</a>
        the moon race as Big Government’s Final Frontier, remarking that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>There’s something about space policy that makes conservatives
            forget their principles. Just one mention of NASA, and conservatives
            are quite happy to check their small-government instincts at the
            door and vote in favor of massive government programs and harsh
            regulations that stifle private enterprise.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>They conclude:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>It is time for conservatives to recognize that Apollo is over. We
            must recognize that Apollo was a centrally planned monopolistic
            government program for a few government employees, in the service of
            Cold War propaganda and was therefore itself an affront to American
            values. If we want to seriously explore, and potentially exploit
            space, we need to harness private enterprise, and push the
            technologies really needed to do so.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Whilst it would be pointlessly upsetting to translate this into a call
        for the <em>denazification</em> of outer space, it would be equally
        misleading to read it as nothing of the kind. Progressive technocracy,
        in a range of national flavors, is the only effective space politics the
        world has ever seen, and it is still far more likely — in the near-term
        — to be modernized than radically supplanted. Space development poses
        such an immense collective challenge that it sucks even liberty-oriented
        conservatives such as Simberg towards accommodation with the activist,
        catalytic, neo-Hamiltonian state. At least initially, there’s simply no
        other place where the clanking machinery of Leviathan is more at home.

        Popular culture has picked up on this well. Among the
        <a href="http://twitchfilm.com/news/2012/05/ten-reasons-to-love-ridley-scotts-alien.php" target="_blank">many
          reasons</a>
        for the ecstatic reception to Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em> (1979) was
        appreciation for its ‘realistic’ tonal portrait of practical space
        activity. Science and commerce played their parts, but the leading edge
        was dominated by quasi-military heavy metal, funded by massive budgets
        based on gravely obscure strategic objectives, directed and crewed by
        hard, obedient, buzz-cut types who did whatever it took to get things
        done. Weapons research trumped all other considerations. Breaking out
        into the deep frontier required a rigid, armored-bulkhead seriousness
        that civilians would never quite understand.

        When suddenly stripped of its Cold War context, the proxy warfaring of
        the rocket-state lost coherent motivation, and immediately veered off
        course into increasingly ludicrous pseudo-objectives. By the closing
        years of the 20th century, all pretense of a big push outwards had been
        dissipated amongst commoditized LEO satellite maintenance, unconvincing
        zero-gravity science projects, ritualistic space-station diplomacy,
        multicultural astronaut PR, and even cynical make-work schemes for
        dangerously competent ex-Soviet technicians. Clever science continued,
        based on robot probes and space telescopes, but none of that even hinted
        at an impetus towards space settlement, or even manned spacecraft, and
        typically advised explicitly against it. Despite all the very real ‘<a
          href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Right-Stuff-Tom-Wolfe/dp/0312427565" target="_blank">right stuff</a>’ heroism,
        putting people in space was a circus act, and perhaps it
        always had been.

        Whatever else outer space may be, it’s a place where the right goes
        schizoid, and the more that it’s thought about, the more jagged the
        split. The seemingly straightforward, dynamic-traditional, and extremely
        stimulating ‘image’ of the <em>frontier</em> illuminates the point. The
        frontier is a space of attenuated formal authority, where
        entrepreneurial, ‘bottom-up’ processes of social formation and economic
        endeavor are cultivated amongst archetypal ‘rugged individualists’, its
        affinity with libertarian impulses so tight that it establishes the
        (‘homesteading’) model of natural property rights, and yet, equally
        undeniably, it is a zone of savage, informal warfare, broken open as a
        policy decision, pacified through the unremitting application of force,
        and developed as a strategic imperative, in the interest of
        territorial-political integration. By fleeing the state, in the
        direction of the frontier, the settler or colonist extends the reach of
        the state towards the frontier, drawing it outwards, and enhancing its
        ferocity, or <em>roughening</em> it. The path of anti-governmental
        flight confuses itself with a corresponding expansion, hardening, and
        re-feralization of the state, as the cavalry learn from the Indians, in
        a place without rules. Then the railroad comes.

          <em>That means that access to space should be almost as routine (if not
            quite as affordable) as access to the oceans, and with similar laws
            and regulations. It means thousands, or millions, of people in space
            — and not just handpicked government employees, but private citizens
            spending their own money for their own purposes. It means that we
            should have the capability to detect an asteroid or comet heading
            for Earth and to deflect it in a timely manner. Similarly it means
            we should be able to mine asteroids or comets for their resources,
            for use in space or on Earth, potentially opening up new wealth for
            the planet. It means that we should explore the solar system the way
            we did the West: not by sending off small teams of government
            explorers — Lewis and Clark were the extreme exception, not the rule
            — but by having lots of people wandering around and peering over the
            next rill in search of adventure or profit.</em>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>There are two related questions posed by human exploration. First,
            is there anything economically useful to do out there, that pays
            your way? And second, can you live off the land, and use local
            resources to survive, or will we always be tied to support from
            earth? If the answer to both is yes, then you get space colonies,
            self-sustainable life off-planet. If the answer to both is no, then
            space is like Mt. Everest. Tourists might go to Mt. Everest, sherpas
            might make a living off of it, but no one really lives there.</em><br />
          <em>If the answer is that you can live off the land, but it’s not
            economically useful, it’s like Antarctica. It was 40 years between
            the last time we were there, when Shackleton reached Antarctica, and
            when the U.S. Navy went back in 1912. There’s a similar lapse
            between going to the Moon the first time and, hopefully, when we’ll
            return. In that case, you can form an outpost and live there, but
            you’re sustained by constant funding, since engineering doesn’t pay
            for itself. If the answer is that there are economically useful
            things to do, such as mining Helium-3 on the Moon, but we’re always
            reliant on Earth for basic necessities, then space becomes a North
            Sea oil platform. You can make money there, but it will always be a
            hostile environment.</em><br />
          <em>These are four very radically different human futures. And they’re
            all part of a larger question: Is there a human future beyond Earth?
            It’s a question ranks up there with whether there’s intelligent life
            elsewhere in the universe. We can search for life with probes and
            telescopes, but to determine the living range of humanity, we’re
            going to have to send humans into space.</em><br />

            for companies offering launch services to get things going. I mean

        The material base for a space-faring future is not only stranded in
        space, but also stranded in time. Not only are the
        gravitationally-unlocked resources from which it would assemble itself
        strewn across intimidating immensities of vacant distance, but the
        threshold where it all begins to come together – in an autocatalytic
        extraterrestrial economy – is separated from the world of present,
        practical incentives by dread gulfs of incalculable loss. In a variant
        of the old joke, if getting off-planet is the goal, a planet is the
        absolutely worst place to set out from. “I can tell you how to get
        there,” the local helpfully remarked. “But you shouldn’t start from
        here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Being out there could quickly start to make sense, as long as we were
        already there. Experimenting with this perspective-switch makes the
        animating impulse clearer. Most tellingly, it exposes how deeply planets
        suck, so that merely not being on one is worth almost anything. That’s
        the end game, the final strategy, ultimately arranging everything, with
        anti-gravity as the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once gravity is perceived as the natural archetype of imprisonment,
        keeping you somewhere, whether you want to be there or not, the
        terrestrial-economic motivations for off-planet expansion are revealed
        in their fundamental spuriousness. The reason to be in space is to be in
        space, freed from planetary suckitude, and any benefits to
        Earth-dwellers that accrue on the way are mere stepping stones.
        Off-planet resources diverted to the surface of the Earth are, in the
        ultimate spacer scheme, wasted, or at least strategically sacrificed
        (since such wastage is almost certainly required in the interim). In the
        final analysis, the value of anything whatsoever is degraded in direct
        proportion to the gravitational influences brought to bear upon it, and
        descent from the heavens is a fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wider cosmo-developmental view sharpens resolution (although this
        requires that Smart’s invaluable
        <a href="https://oldnicksite.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/implosion/">insights</a>
        are strictly set aside, and black holes avoided with maximum prejudice).
        Smear into fast-forward until the process of extraterrestrial escape has
        been substantially accomplished, then freeze the screens. Fleeing
        gravity can now be seen as no more than the first step in a more
        thorough, antagonistic contestation with gravity and its works.
        Asteroids and comets are being pulverized, quarried, or bored into
        sponges, leaving moons, planets, and the sun itself as the local
        problems of interest. Such bodies are ‘problems’ because they deform
        space with gravity wells, which trap resources, but their status as
        development obstacles can be abstracted further. These worlds, at least
        partially isolated from the emerging deep-space <em>commercium</em> by
        their own mass, have been shaped by gravity into approximate spheres,
        which is to say – from the developmental perspective – into the very
        <em>worst</em> shapes that are mathematically <em>possible</em>, since
        they minimize the ratio of (reactive) surface to volume, and thus
        restrict resource accessibility to the greatest conceivable extent. Way
        out there, in deep space and the deep future, the gathering
        developmental impulse is to go full
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon" target="_blank">Vogon</a>,
        and demolish them completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        When seen from outside, planets are burial sites, where precious
        minerals are interred. By digging through the earth’s mantle, for
        instance, all the way down to its interior end, 3,000km beneath the
        surface, one reaches a high-pressure iron-nickel deposit over 6,500km in
        diameter – a planet-vaulted metal globe roughly 160,000,000,000 cubic
        kilometers in size, doped by enough gold and platinum to coat the entire
        surface of the earth to a depth of half a meter. To a moderately
        advanced off-world civilization, pondering the practicalities of its
        first planet-scale demolition, leaving this buried resource trove in
        place has a robotic-industrial opportunity cost that can be
        conservatively estimated in the region of 1.6 x 10^23 human-level
        intelligences, a mineral stockpile sufficient to manufacture a trillion
        sentient self-replicating probes for every star in the galaxy. (Even
        ardent conservationists have to recognize how tasty this morsel will
        look.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lift-off</em>, then, is merely a precursor to the first serious
        plateau of anti-gravity technology, which is oriented towards the more
        profoundly productive task of <em>pulling things apart</em>, in order to
        convert comparatively inert mass-spheres into volatile clouds of
        cultural substance. Assuming a fusion-phase energy infrastructure, this
        initial stage of off-world development culminates in the dismantling of
        the sun, terminating the absurdly wasteful main-sequence nuclear
        process, salvaging its fuel reserves, and thus making the awakened
        solar-system’s contribution to the techno-industrial darkening of the
        galaxy. (Quit squandering hydrogen, and the lights dim.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus for a few seconds on the economic irritability that arises at the
        sight of an oil-well flaring off natural gas, through sheer mindless
        incompetence, then glance at the sun. ‘Unsustainable’ doesn’t begin to
        capture it. Clearly, this energy machinery is utterly demented,
        amounting to an
        <a href="http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Azathoth" target="_blank">Azathothic</a>
        orgy of spilled photons. The entire apparatus needs to be taken apart,
        through extreme solar surgery. Since this project has yet to receive
        sustained consideration, however, the specific engineering details can
        be safely bracketed for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inexorable logic of techno-industrial efficiency, on its
        anti-gravity vector, means that
        <em>the only consistent motivation for leaving the earth is to dismantle
          the sun</em>
        (along with the rest of the solar-system), but that doesn’t play well in
        Peoria. Unsurprisingly, therefore, those sensitized to political
        realities, media perceptions, and public relations are inclined to
        emphasize other things, depicting the earth as a destination for cosmic
        bounty or — even more immediately — for juicy tax-funded
        <a href="http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Time_To_End_Pork_Barrel_Monster_Rocket_And_Expensive_Russian_Space_Ferry_999.html"
          target="_blank">pork</a>, rather than as a tricky but highly-rewarding demolition problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conspicuously missing from the public space debate, therefore, is any
        frank admission that, “(let’s face it folks) — planets are
        misallocations of matter which don’t really work. No one wants to tell
        you that, but it’s true. You know that we deeply respect the green
        movement, but when we get out there onto the main highway of
        solar-system redevelopment, and certain very rigid, very extreme
        environmentalist attitudes – Gaian survivalism, terrestrial holism,
        planetary preservationism, that sort of thing — are blocking the way
        forward, well, let me be very clear about this, that means jobs not
        being created, businesses not being built, factories closing down in the
        asteroid belt, growth foregone. Keeping the earth together means dollars
        down the drain – a lot of dollars, <em>your dollars</em>. There are
        people, sincere people, good people, who strongly oppose our plans to
        deliberately disintegrate the earth. I understand that, really I do, you
        know – honestly – I used to feel that way myself, not so long ago. I,
        too, wanted to believe that it was possible to leave this world in one
        piece, just as it has been for four billion years now. I, too, thought
        the old ways were probably best, that this planet was the place we
        belonged, that we should – and could — still find some alternative to
        pulling it apart. I remember those dreams, really I do, and I still hold
        them close to my heart. But, people, they were just dreams, old and
        noble dreams, but dreams, and today I’m here to tell you that we have to
        wake up. Planets aren’t our friends. They’re speed-bumps on the road to
        the future, and we simply can’t afford them anymore. Let’s back them up
        digitally, with respect, yes, even with love, and
        <em>then let’s get to work</em>…” [Thunderous applause]
      </p>
      <p>
        Since, during the present stage of extraterrestrial ambition, pandering
        to the partisans of cosmic disintegrationism cannot reasonably be
        conceived as a sure-fire election winner, it is only to be expected that
        rhetoric of this kind has been muted. Yet, in the absence of some such
        vision, or consistently extrapolated alignment with anti-gravity, the
        off-planet impulse is condemned to arbitrariness, insubstantiality, and
        insincerity of expression. Absent an uncompromised sense of something
        else, why not stick to this? The result has been, perhaps predictably, a

        If escaping the earth – and gravitational confinement in general — is
        not an intelligible end, but only a means, what provides the motivation?
        It is into this cramped, awkwardly-deformed crevice of aspiration that
        NewSpace must insinuate itself. To speak of ‘insincerity’ might seem
        unduly harsh – since there is no reason to suspect conscious deception,
        or even carefully-calibrated reservation, when NewSpace advocates
        outline their plans. An enveloping structure of implausibility
        nevertheless announces itself in every project that is advanced,
        manifested through the incommensurability between the scale of the
        undertaking and the rewards that supposedly incentivize it.

          experimentation
          and manufacturing</a>… really? Is it genuinely imaginable that these paltry goals finally or
        sufficiently motivate a prolonged struggle against the terrestrial
        gravity-trap, rather than serving as fragile <em>pretexts</em> or
        <em>rationalizations</em> for the pursuit of far more compelling, yet
        hazy, unarticulated, or even completely unsuspected objectives?
      </p>
      <p>
        When this question is extended backwards, and outwards, it gathers
        force. Stretch it back to the moon, and out to Mars, and the inference
        becomes increasingly irresistible. None of these ‘missions’ made, or
        make, any sense whatsoever, except insofar as they abbreviate some
        wider, undisclosed impulse. Space activity is not the means to a
        targeted end, but the end to be advanced by a sequence of missions,
        whose specific content is therefore derivative, and devoid of intrinsic
        significance. Once the inarticulate outward momentum decays, leaving
        nothing but an arbitrary extraterrestrial destination to represent it,
        the naked absurdity that is exposed rapidly extinguishes the last,
        flickering embers of popular motivation. Four decades of explicit
        <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/neil-armstrong-and-the-end-of-the-whig-conceit/"
          target="_blank">lunar nihilism</a>
        attest abundantly to that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst the partial privatization of space activity (‘NewSpace’)
        creatively displaces the problem of purpose, it does not radically
        dispel it. To some degree, NewSpace substitutes the economic motivations
        of disparate private operators for the political justification of a
        concentrated public bureaucracy, and by doing so it relieves the
        pressure to maintain coherent, communicable, and consensual objectives.
        Space ambitions are freed to enter the fragmented, competitive terrain
        of idiosyncrasy, variety, experimentation, and even personally-financed
        frivolity. It might even be thought that seriousness becomes optional.
      </p>
      <p>
        When examined more doggedly, however, it is clear that the basic problem
        persists. The terrestrial gravity-well produces a split between the
        surface of the earth, and ‘orbit’ (or beyond), and private capital is no
        less severely divided by this schism than Rocket-State ‘public’
        hardware. Whilst convertible temporarily into forms of inert, stored
        value, capital is an essentially modern phenomenon, born in industrial
        revolution, and typically defined by the diversion of immediate
        consumption into ‘roundabout’ production, which is to say: machinery. It
        is reproduced, or accumulated, by circulating through machines, or
        apparatus, and it is upon this that the gravity-well compels a decision:
        is NewSpace capital to be invested, unambiguously, <em>in space</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        A serious space program is, fundamentally and irreducibly, a process or
        terrestrial evacuation. It requires the consistent relocation (or
        de-location) of enterprise, resources, and productive capabilities from
        the earth into space, at least until the threshold of extraterrestrial
        autocatalysis is reached, at which point a break has been achieved, and
        an autonomous off-planet economy established. Whatever the opportunities
        for obfuscation (which are probably considerable), the basic
        <em>decision</em> remains unaffected. The accumulation of a terrestrial
        fortune is not at all the same, and is in fact almost certainly
        economically inconsistent, with the sustained investment in an
        off-planet industrial infrastructure. <em>Either</em> stuff is being
        shifted into space, irrevocably, <em>or not</em>.

        The peculiarities of the ‘space race’ have yet to be fully unfolded.
        Through its extraordinary formality, reducing extraterrestrial ambitions
        to a binary, international competition to put the first man on the moon,
        it seems – retrospectively – to owe more to the culture and history of
        organized sports than to technological and economic accomplishments.
        There would, by definition, be a winner and a loser, which is to say a
        Boolean decision, conventional and indisputable. Then it would be over.
        Perhaps it was seen to be pointing at something further, but in fact the
        moon was a finishing line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a broad geo-strategic context, the space race was a symptom of
        thermonuclear stand-off. A modern history of warfare that had descended
        inexorably from a restrained game of princes to unleashed total war,
        amongst ideologically-mobilized peoples, targeting their basic
        institutions, industrial infrastructures, and even demographic
        root-stocks, had consummated itself – virtually – in the MAD potential
        for swift, reciprocal extermination. Under these circumstances, a
        regressive sublimation was called for, relaying conflict through
        chivalric representatives – even Homeric heroes – who competed on behalf
        of the super-lethal populations they appeased. The flight of an
        astronaut symbolized antagonism, substituting for a nuclear strike. In
        this sense, victory in the space race was a thinly-disguised advance
        payment on the conclusion of the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sublimation is only half of the story, however, because a double
        displacement took place. Whilst the space race substituted a formal
        (chivalric) outcome for a military result, it also marginalized the
        long-envisaged prospect of informal space colonization, replacing it
        with a predominantly conventional (or socio-political) objective. The
        price of unambiguous symbolic triumph was a ‘triumph’ that relapsed into
        the <em>real ambiguity</em> of (mere) symbolism, with reality-denying,
        postmodernist, ‘moon hoax’ temptations already rising. When nothing is
        won except winning itself, it could scarcely be otherwise. A champion is
        not a settler, or anything close to one.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is this real ambiguity? It begins on the frontier, with a series of
        questions that reaches beyond the meaning of the space race, and into
        the identity of America. As a country settled within the modern epoch,
        and thus exhaustively determined by the dynamics of colonialism, America
        has been condensed from a frontier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In extended parenthesis, it is worth noting explicitly that the
        continent’s aboriginal population was not yet America, but something
        earlier, and other, encountered on the frontier. The idea of a ‘Native
        American’ is an exercise in historical misdirection, when it is not
        merely a thoughtless oxymoron. This is not to suggest that these
        populations were unable to <em>become American</em>, as many did, once
        America had begun in the modern period. By innovating distinctive modes
        of secession, they were even — in certain cases — able to become
        radically American. A reservation casino in institutional flight from
        the IRS is vastly more American than the Federal Reserve, in a sense
        that will (hopefully) become evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of America was a flight into the frontier, extending a
        trajectory of escape into a perpetually receding space, or open horizon
        — the future made geography, and only subsequently a political
        territory. This original, informal, and inherently obscure space project
        is as old as America itself – exactly as old. As Frederick Jackson
        Turner had already noted in 1893, for America an open frontier is an
        existential necessity, which is to say: the basic condition of American
        existence. Once the frontier closes, borders take over, exceptionality
        withers into insubstantial rhetoric (or worse, its neoconservative
        facsimile) and necrosis begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this respect, America cannot be sustained as a state with a space
        program. It requires an open horizon, extended beyond the earth if
        necessary, sufficient to support a prolongation of its constitutive
        colonial process. Only on and out of this <em>frontier</em> does America
        have a future, although ‘the USA’ could (more) comfortably persist
        without it. That is why, beneath, alongside, and beyond the space race,
        the frontier ‘myth’ has been spontaneously extended to extraterrestrial
        vistas considered as <em>an essentially American prospect</em>. (NASA
        and its works are quite incidental to this, at best.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this claim invites accusations of gratuitous controversy, it is
        worth re-visiting it, at a more languid pace. Even after re-emphasizing
        that <em>America</em> is not the same as – and is indeed almost the
        precise opposite of – <em>the USA</em>, obvious objections present
        themselves. Is not the Russian space program the world’s most
        economically plausible? Is not the upward curve of recent Chinese space
        activity vastly more exuberant? Hasn’t the United Nations claimed the
        heavens on behalf of a common humanity? What, other than
        cultural-historical accident, and the unwarranted arrogance stemming
        from it, could imaginably make ‘an essentially American prospect’ of
        outer space?
      </p>
      <p>
        The counter-point to all of these objections is <em>colonialism</em>,
        understood through its radical, exceptional, American lineage.
        Colonialism of this ultimate variety consolidates itself from the
        frontier, and passes through revolutionary thresholds of a very specific
        type: wars of independence, or secession (rather than comprehensive
        regime changes) that are <em>pro-colonial</em> (rather than
        anti-colonial) in nature. The colony, as colony, breaks away, and in
        doing so creates a new society. Successful examples of such events are
        extremely rare – even singular, or <em>exceptional</em>. There is
        America, and then there are ‘lost causes’, with considerable (and
        increasing) overlap between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        What has any of this to do with outer space, beyond impressionistic
        analogy? Gravity cements the connection. Dividing the surface of the
        earth and extraterrestrial space is an effective difference, or
        practical problem, that can be quite precisely quantified in
        technological terms (fuel to deliverable payload ratios), and summarized
        economically. For purposes of comparison, transporting freight across
        the Pacific costs US$4/kg (by air), or US$0.16/kg by ocean-bound
        container vessel (US$3,500 per TEU, or 21,600 kg). To lift 1 kg of cargo
        into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), in stark contrast, costs over US$4,000 (it
        was over US$10,000 by Space Shuttle). Call it <em>the Rift</em>: an
        immense structural re-supply problem, incentivizing economic
        self-sufficiency with overwhelming force. Each kilogram of
        extraterrestrial product has saved US$4,000 before further calculations
        get started. Out in space, the Rift is the bottom line: a cold,
        anti-umbilical reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the historic colonial impetus to the <em>American way</em> –
        separation and social re-foundation – is reinforced by orders of
        magnitude in LEO and beyond. This is an environment that might have been
        precision-engineered for revolutionary colonialism, as science fiction
        writers have long recognized. On the flip side lies a more obviously
        explanatory conclusion: Because developments beyond the Rift are
        inherently uncontrollable, there is no readily discernible motivation
        for terrestrial political-economic agencies to fund the emergence of
        off-planet societies that are on an irresistible conveyor-belt to
        independence, whilst voraciously consuming resources, opening an avenue
        of escape, and ultimately laying the void foundations for a competitor
        civilization of a radically unprecedented, and thus ominously
        unpredictable kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows clearly that the <em>status quo</em> politics of space
        colonization are almost fully expressed by
        <em>space colonization not happening</em>. When understood in relation
        to the eclipsed undercurrent of the frontier analogy — social fission
        through revolutionary colonialism or wars of independence — the
        ‘failure’ of large-scale space colonization projects to emerge begins to
        look like something else entirely: an eminently rational determination
        on the part of the world’s most powerful territorial states to inhibit
        the development of socio-technological potentials characterized by an
        ‘American’ (revolutionary colonial) tendency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, in a world that grown familiar with interchangeable
        anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist declarations, the terms of this
        (Froude / Moldbug / Donald) analysis are initially disconcerting. When
        detached from the confusions and conflations of a disturbed periphery,
        however, the pattern is compelling. Colonists are, by their very nature,
        in flight from the metropolis. It is less than a single step from this
        acknowledgement to the recognition that they tend to independence of
        action, social fission, and political disintegration, following trends
        that imperialists – with equal inevitability — seek to curtail. Since
        colonization, strictly understood, is cultural and demographic
        transplantation, it only acquires its sense of <em>expansion</em> when
        restrained under imperial auspices. Whilst <em>colonial</em> and
        <em>rebellious</em> are not even close to synonymous expressions, they
        are nevertheless mutually attracted, in near-direct proportion to the
        rift that separates colony from metropolis. A colonial venture is a
        rebellion of the most practical and productive kind, either re-routing a
        rebellion from time into space, or completing itself in a rebellion that
        transforms an expedition into an escape. Since the triumph of
        imperialism over colonialism beginning in the second half of the 19th
        century, it is only in (and as) America that this system of relations
        has persisted, tenuously, and in large measure occulted by the rise of
        an imperial state.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is helpful, then, to differentiate in principle (with minimal moral
        excitability) between a <em>colonial</em> space project, oriented to
        extraterrestrial settlement, and an <em>imperial</em> space program, or
        policy, designed to ensure terrestrial control over off-planet
        development, maintain political integrity, and thus secure returns on
        investment across the Rift. From the perspective of the territorial
        state, an (imperial) space program that extracted economic value from
        beyond earth’s gravity well would be ideal, but this is an ambition
        unsupported by the vaguest flickerings of historical precedent (and
        obstructed by at least four orders of magnitude of yawning economic
        gulf). Second best, and quite satisfactory, is the simple prevention of
        colonial space projects, substituting political space theater as an
        expensive (but low-risk and affordable) alternative. The occasional man
        on the moon poses no great threat to the order of the world, so long as
        we “bring him safely back to earth.”
      </p>

        America was an escape from the Old World, and this definition suffices
        to describe what it still is – insofar as it still is – as well as what
        it can be, all that it can be, and what any escape from the new old
        world – if accurately named, would also be. When outlined by the shadows
        of dark enlightenment, America is the problem that the USA was designed
        to solve, the door that the USA closes, the proper name for a society
        born from flight.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Nietzsche never exactly said:
        <em>Am I understood? America against the stars and stripes …</em>

        Frederick Jackson Turner, from his
        <a href="https://www.learner.org/workshops/primarysources/corporations/docs/turner2.html">essay</a>
        <em>The Significance of the Frontier in American History</em> (1893):
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>From the conditions of frontier life came intellectual traits of
          profound importance. The works of travelers along each frontier from
          colonial days onward describe certain common traits, and these traits
          have, while softening down, still persisted as survivals in the place
          of their origin, even when a higher social organization succeeded. The
          result is that, to the frontier, the American intellect owes its
          striking characteristics. That coarseness and strength combined with
          acuteness and inquisitiveness, that practical, inventive turn of mind,
          quick to find expedients, that masterful grasp of material things,
          lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends, that
          restless, nervous energy, that dominant individualism, working for
          good and for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes
          with freedom — these are traits of the frontier, or traits called out
          elsewhere because of the existence of the frontier. […] Since the days
          when the fleet of Columbus sailed into the waters of the New World,
          America has been another name for opportunity, and the people of the
          United States have taken their tone from the incessant expansion which
          has not only been open but has even been forced upon them. He would be
          a rash prophet who should assert that the expansive character of
          American life has now entirely ceased. Movement has been its dominant
          fact, and, unless this training has no effect upon a people, the
          American energy will continually demand a wider field for its
          exercise. But never again will such gifts of free land offer
          themselves. […] For a moment, at the frontier, the bonds of custom are
          broken and unrestraint is triumphant. There is not
          <strong>tabula rasa</strong>. The stubborn American environment is
          there with its imperious summons to accept its conditions; the
          inherited ways of doing things are also there; and yet, in spite of
          environment, and in spite of custom, each frontier did indeed furnish
          a new field of opportunity, a gate of escape from the bondage of the
          past; and freshness, and confidence, and scorn of older society,
          impatience of its restraints and its ideas, and indifference to its
          lessons, have accompanied the frontier.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Recollected with reference to the prospects of
        <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2009/06/08/20000-nations-above-the-sea">seasteading</a>
        and space colonization, and their continuity with a distinctive
        Anglophone cultural impetus to resolve political tension through
        dissociation in space (with <em>Exit</em> as its key).

        <em>There’s a lot of hand-wringing in these parts of the interwebz about
          what reactionaries should do.</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          I have no idea. I certainly have no grand plans to change the world. I
          like knowing what’s going on around me and I like open discussions –
          i.e. ones that are not choked to death by political correctness.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>However, if I were to suggest a plan, I’d say tell the truth.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        His (slightly) more detailed suggestions are also commendable. The
        Cathedral provokes reaction by mandating fantasy over reality, and there
        is no doubt much that could be

      </p>
      <p>
        There is a sub-question about all this, however, which is scarcely less
        insistent: What do ‘we’ really want?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More
          <a href="http://aretae.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-aretaevianism.html">cybernetics</a></em>,
        argues the determinedly non-reactionary Aretae. Of course,
        <em>Outside in</em> agrees. Social and technical feedback machinery is
        reality’s (only?) friend, but what does the Cathedral care about any of
        that? It’s winning a war of religion. Compulsory anti-realism is the
        reigning spirit of the age.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to get more tight-feedback under current conditions is by
        splitting, in every sense. That is the overwhelming practical
        imperative: Flee, break up, withdraw, and evade. Pursue every path of
        autonomization, fissional federalism, political disintegration,
        secession, exodus, and concealment. Route around the Cathedral’s
        educational, media, and financial apparatus in each and every way
        possible. Prep, go Galt, go crypto-digital, expatriate, retreat into the
        hills, go underground, seastead, build black markets, whatever works,
        but <em>get the hell out</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth-telling already presupposes an escape from the empire of
        neo-puritan dreams. ‘We’ need to throw open the exit gates, wherever we
        find them, so the wreck can go under without us. Reaction begins with
        the proposition that nothing can or should be done to save it. Quit
        bailing. It’s done. The sooner it sinks the better, so that something
        else can begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything we can say, practical exit is the crucial signal. The
        only pressure that matters comes from that. To find ways out, is to let
        the <em>Outside in</em>.

        as if France is going to provide an important demonstration:
      </p>
      <p><em>France has become a defeatist nation.</em></p>
      <p>
        <em>A striking indicator of this attitude is the massive emigration that
          the country has witnessed over the last decade, with nearly 2 million
          French citizens choosing to leave their country and take their chances
          in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the United States and other
          locales. The last such collective exodus from France came during the
          French Revolution, when a large part of the aristocracy left to await
          (futilely) the king’s return. Today’s migration isn’t politically
          motivated, however; it’s economic.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This departing population consists disproportionately of young people
          — 70% of the migrants are under 40 — and advanced-degree holders, who
          do their studies in France but offer their skills elsewhere. The
          migrants, discouraged by the economy’s comparatively low salaries and
          persistently high unemployment — currently at 10.9% — have only grown
          in number since Socialist Francois Hollande became president.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The young and enterprising in France soon realize that elsewhere — in
          London, say — obstacles to success are fewer and opportunities
          greater. The British capital is now France’s sixth-largest city, with
          200,000 to 400,000 emigres.<br /> </em><br />
        <em>The exile rolls also include hundreds of thousands of French
          retirees, presumably well-off, who are spending at least part of their
          golden years in other countries. Tired of France’s high cost of
          living, they seek out more welcoming environments.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My beloved country, in other words, has been losing not only its
          dynamic and intelligent young people but also older people with some
          money. I’m not sure that this social model can work over the long
          term.</em>

      <h4 class="post-title">Exit notes (#1)</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Some notable attempts to dial back the NRx commitment to
        <em>exit over voice</em>, as inherited from Moldbug, have been
        <a href="http://mitrailleuse.net/2014/06/24/exit-no-exit/">seen</a>
        <a href="https://justinetunney.com/exit.html">recently</a>. (I think NBS
        was crucial in advancing this argument, but I couldn’t find his post
        immediately — I’ll link to it if someone nudges me helpfully.) It’s
        undoubtedly a central discussion throughout the reactosphere at the
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>Some preliminary thought-gathering on the topic:</p>
      <p>
        (1) Exit is a scale-free concept. It can be applied rigorously to
        extreme cases of sociopolitical separation, from secession to
        extraterrestrial escapes. Yet these radical examples do not define it.
        It’s essence is the commercial relation, which necessarily involves a
        non-transaction option. Exit means: <em>Take it or leave it</em> (but
        don’t haggle). It is thus, at whatever scale of expression, the concrete
        social implementation of freedom as an operational principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) As a philosophical stance, Exit is anti-dialectical. That is to say,
        it is the insistence of an option against argument, especially refusing
        the idea of <em>necessary political discussion</em> (a notion which, if
        accepted, guarantees progression to the left).
        <em>Let’s spatialize our disagreement</em> is an alternative to
        resolution in time. Conversations can be prisons. No one is owed a
        hearing.
      </p>
      <p><span id="more-2893"></span></p>
      <p>
        (3) In regards to cultural cladistics, it can scarcely be denied that
        Exit has a Protestant lineage. Its theological associations are intense,
        and stimulating.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Exit asymmetries have been by far the most decisive generators of
        spontaneous anti-socialist ideology. The iconic meaning of the Berlin
        Wall needs no further elucidation. The implicit irony is that
        <em>people flee <strong>towards</strong> Exit</em>, and if this is only
        possible virtually, it metamorphoses automatically into delegitimation
        of the inhibitory regime. (Socialism is Exit-suppressive by definition.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) <em>Exit is an option</em>, which does not require execution for its
        effectiveness. The case for Exit is not an argument for flight, but a
        (non-dialectical) defense of the opportunity for flight. Where Exit most
        fully flourishes, it is employed the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) Exit is the alternative to voice. It is defended with extremity in
        order to mute voice with comparable extremity. To moderate the case for
        Exit is implicitly to make a case for voice. (Those who cannot exit a
        deal will predictably demand to haggle over it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (7) Exit is the primary Social Darwinian weapon. To blunt it is to
        welcome entropy to your hearth.

        <em>… the costs of exit are going down. Increased mobility and smaller
          political units will allow people increasingly to vote with their
          feet. The old political questions of which ideological empire controls
          which territory will give way to a choose-your-own-governance meta
          system. […] Thus, to be successful, political units will have to
          attract residents—that is, to providing better services at lower cost.
          Increased competition among smaller political units will spur
          innovation, leading to new forms of governance. Many will fail. But
          the successful will be replicated, outcompeting more stagnant forms.
          Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein show the
          beginnings of such success. […] Not all the governments will be
          libertarian. In fact, most probably will not be. Some will experiment
          with higher levels of redistribution; others with petty tyrannies,
          zealous zoning and even social exclusion. However, competition will
          eliminate unsuccessful models. Ultimately, the meta-rules that are
          emerging are decidedly libertarian in flavor, as choice will govern
          the survival of political units.</em>

        The left won’t like this, for obvious reasons. It is dissolidarity
        incarnate, with an egalitarian-democratic promise that is minimal, at
        best. I’m not sure whether the criticism has developed beyond indignant
        scoffing to calmly-formulated theoretical antagonism yet, but it surely
        will.

      <p>
        The right’s objections are likely to be more diverse. Most pointedly,
        from the perspective here, there is room for deep skepticism about the
        harshness of the selection mechanisms Lutter is counting upon. Driving a
        state into insolvency, and liquidation, is no easy thing. For those,
        especially, who would be delighted to see effective inter-state
        Darwinism cropping micro-states for adaptive excellence, cold realism
        concerning the capabilities of states to forestall such outcomes is
        essential. If widespread conflict-free high-functionality futures sound
        too good to be true, they probably are.

          power with this policy on their legislative agenda, we have promptly
          ordered all of our staff to depart from the United Kingdom and to
          conduct all future development work abroad. […] Additionally, with
          immediate effect, we have moved our corporate headquarters to New York
          City, where open-source cryptography is firmly established as

        Everyone will notice them when they’ve
        <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-05/next-round-war-cash-will-be-even-more-aggressive">gone</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All recent policy decisions by the reigning political-economic structure
        are intelligible as a <em>mandatory bubble</em>. If you didn’t think
        quietly ‘sitting it out’ was already the exercise of an exit option, the
        necessary lesson will be increasingly hard to ignore. Refusing to invest
        everything into this lunacy is ceasing to be a permissible social
        posture. We’ve already reached the stage where merely seeking to
        preserve a pot of retirement savings has been officially recoded as
        something close to right-wing guerrilla warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anybody with anything at all is now in the position where they are faced
        with an aggressive binary dilemma. <em>Either</em> unreserved
        collaboration with the final phase gamble of the existing order —
        amounting ultimately to the all-in bet that politics has no ontological
        limits, so that any dysfunction is soluble in a sufficient exertion of
        will — <em>or</em> a dissident skepticism about this dominant assertion,
        practically instantiated by ever more desperate attempts at withdrawal
        (persecuted with ever greater fanaticism as acts of sabotage).
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be massive confusion among the destitution. Explaining why
        capital preservation is being persecuted as dissent would provide the
        scaffolding for a counter-narrative that will certainly, eventually, be
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADDED: The basic point is this, if it is conceded to Keynes that
        <em>refusing to invest in industrial production is anti-social</em>,
        then, as a matter of realistic political necessity,
        <em>any insane evil that the powers-that-be come up with gets defined as
          ‘industrial production’</em>. Let go of gold — the archaic economic exit option — as we did, and
        anything at all that we’re told to sink all we have into is
        green-lighted. The stream was crossed without enough people noticing.
        Now the fascism we chose reaps its consequences. It isn’t going to be
        pretty.

        Having lost count of the number of times the demand for
        <em>exit guarantees</em> has come up as an objection to the
        Patchworked-Neocameral model, it seems worthwhile to reproduce Moldbug’s
        most directly on-point, pre-emptive response to the question. The
        question being:
        <em>What is to stop a regime, once it is entirely unshackled from all
          domestic political constraint (i.e. Neocameralized), from
          extinguishing the exit options of its residents?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a prefatory note: Like the Misesian praxeology from which it is
        cladistically descended, the Moldbuggian System is a
        <em>transcendental</em> political philosophy, which is to say that it
        deals with ultimate or unsurpassable conditions. You have reached the
        transcendental when there is no higher tribunal, or court of appeal.
        This is the socio-cosmic buffers. If you don’t like what you’re seeing
        here, there’s still no point looking anywhere else, because
        <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.hk/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1.html">this</a>
        is all you’re going to get:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To live on a Patchwork patch, you have to sign a bilateral contract
          with the realm. You promise to be a good boy and behave yourself. The
          realm promises to treat you fairly. There is an inherent asymmetry in
          this agreement, because you have no enforcement mechanism against the
          realm (just as you have no enforcement mechanism against the United
          States). However, a realm’s compliance with its customer-service
          agreements is sure to be a matter of rather intense attention among
          residents and prospective residents. And thus among shareholders as
          well.</em>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          For example, I suspect that every customer-service agreement will
          include the right to remove oneself and one’s assets from the realm,
          at any time, no questions asked, to any other realm that will accept
          the emigrant. Possibly with an exception for those involved in the
          criminal-justice process – but this may not even be needed. Who wants
          a criminal? Not another realm, surely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose a realm unilaterally abrogates this right of emigration? It
          has just converted its residents into what are, in a sense, slaves. It
          is no longer Disneyland. It is a plantation. If it’s any good with
          cinderblocks, barbed-wire and minefields, there is no escape. What do
          you say if you’re stuck on this farm? You say: “yes, Massa.” A slave
          you are and a slave you will be forever.
        </p>
      </em>
      <p>
        <em>This is terrible, of course. But again, the mechanism we rely on to
          prevent it is no implausible deus ex machina, no Indian rope-trick
          from the age of Voltaire, but the sound engineering principle of the
          profit motive. A realm that pulls this kind of crap cannot be trusted
          by anyone ever again. It is not even safe to visit. Tourism
          disappears. The potential real-estate bid from immigrants disappears.
          And, while your residents are indeed stuck, they are also remarkably
          sullen and display no great interest in slaving for you. Which is a
          more valuable patch of real estate, today: South Korea, or North
          Korea? Yet before the war, the North was more industrialized and the
          South was more rural. Such are the profits of converting an entire
          country into a giant Gulag.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that all? Yes — that’s all. Beyond the rational economic incentives
        of the Sovereign Corporation, controlled within a Patchwork-environment
        (of competition for human resources), there is nothing to which an
        appeal can be made. The end.

          Frankfurt, leaving the service sector and multiethnic urban poor
          behind</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specifics of this prediction are nutty, if only because mainland
        Europe is going down the tubes much faster than the UK, but the
        <em>abstract anxiety</em> is spot on. The globalization of the right is
        entirely about geopolitical arbitrage (while that of the left is about
        homogenizing global governance). All the critical trends point towards
        the exacerbation of the ‘problem’. The 21st century is the epoch of
        fragmentation — unlike anything seen since the early modern period —
        shifting power to the footloose, and away from megapolitical systems of
        territorial dominion. <em>Being left behind</em> is the rising threat,
        and we can confidently expect to see it consolidating as the subtext of
        all leftist grievance. <em>You can’t just leave</em>. Watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obstacles to geopolitical arbitrage — i.e. spatial Exit pressure —
        are security constraints. It requires defensible off-shore bases (and
        Frankfurt most certainly isn’t going to provide one). Eyes need to be
        fixed firmly on secessionary dynamics (fragmentation), techno-commercial
        decentralization of hard security, crypto-anonymization, artificial
        intelligence, and the emergence of capital outposts in the Western
        Pacific region. More exotic factors include opportunities for radical
        exodus (undersea, Antarctic, and off-planet), facilitated by
        <em>territorial production</em> (artificial islands). The machinery of
        capture needs to keep <em>all</em> of these escape routes firmly
        suppressed in order to perpetuate itself. That simply isn’t going to
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capital is learning faster than its adversaries, and has done so since
        it initially became self-propelling, roughly half a millennium ago. It’s
        allergic to socialism (obviously), and tends to flee places where
        socialist influence is substantially greater than zero. Unless caged
        definitively, eventually it breaks out. Over the next few decades —
        despite ever deeper encryption — it should become unmistakable which way
        that’s going.

          Narratives of military tactical dominance alongside “NewSpace”

          We — all us queer, trans, disabled, black, native, etc. folk and

      <p>
        This is a nonlinear point, from my perspective, since the rapid
        development of telepresence is of obvious internal consequence to the
        recent intensification of Exit-oriented and neo-secessionist discussion.
        (Balaji S. Srinivasan brought this out very clearly in his October 2013
        <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/2013/10/balaji-srinivasan-on-silicon-valleys-ultimate-exit/">talk</a>
        on the subject, from which this event takes its title.) Exit in depth —
        i.e. into the crypto-thickened ‘Net — is at the very least an important
        complement to more traditional notions of territorial flight. It also
        sustains a better purchase on the commercial principle which provides
        Exit with its fundamentalal model, and which can easily get lost among
        secessionist excitement and visions of technologically re-sculpted
        geographical space.

        other side of the nonlinearity (a micro-enactment of the inclusive

        occasion the controversy can remain productive in its own terms, rather

          — operating systems being developed by companies such as Apple and
          Google that automatically encrypt information on their devices. And
          that means even the companies themselves won’t be able to unlock
          phones, laptops and other devices so law enforcement can access
          emails, photos or other evidence that could be crucial to a case …
        </em>
      </p>
      <em> </em>
      <p>
        <em>Comey, however, didn’t place full blame with companies like Apple and
          Google for creating devices with such encryption. They were
          “responding to what they perceive is a market demand” from the general
          public, which has grown “mistrustful of government” in the wake of
          Edward Snowden’s disclosures of secret government surveillance. […]
          Encryption “is a marketing pitch,” Comey said. “But it will have very
          serious consequences for law enforcement and
          <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/national-security.htm">national security</a>
          agencies at all levels. Sophisticated criminals will come to count on
          these means of evading detection. It’s the equivalent of a closet that
          can’t be opened. A safe that can’t be cracked. And my question is, at
          what cost?”</em>

        A process of Exit-in-place is underway, automatically, and it’s not easy
        to imagine how it could be stopped. With message management
        disintegrating on
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/interface/">one</a> side, and the
        public sphere eroding into dark nets on the other, it must seem to the
        State in the age of Internet runaway that the walls are closing in.

        (via <a href="https://twitter.com/Mangan150">Mangan</a>) is such naked

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>… markets are behaving exactly as one would expect at the end of a
          major economic era. That is, markets are totally divorced from the
          reality of what is going on both economically and geopolitically.
          Markets are now in a manic phase, driven by false hope and momentum.
          […] It clearly helps that many economic figures are manipulated and
          therefore totally inaccurate. If we add to this the most massive money
          creation in history, we can be certain that these are not normal
          times. […] We are experiencing the beginning of a hyperinflationary
          period, with hyperinflation, so far, being noticed only in financial
          markets, property markets, and other key assets such as art and
          classic cars. […] And currencies will continue their decline to zero.
          Continued money printing will guarantee this. And we have to remember
          that the major currencies don’t have far to go since they are down
          between 97 and 99 percent in the last hundred years. As currencies
          start the next major phase of decline we will experience
          hyperinflation in all parts of the economy. This hyperinflation will
          be happening in most major countries. …</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not just that the analysis is solidly grounded in an obdurate
        realism (this is the raw economics of Gnon), it’s also that:<br />
        (a) Gold is the traditional medium of economic-regime exit, and
        therefore<br />
        (b) This discourse is immediately anti-politics (or resistance).<br />
        It says: <em>Get out!</em> That’s not a message to be easily decrypted
        for representational content, because it’s a war cry.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does a hyperinflationary collapse begin? With a flight to gold.
        <em>There’s going to be hyperinflation — flee to gold</em>. It’s a
        circuit. The Cathedral’s economic authorities are entirely justified in
        considering such messaging aggressive (even ‘terroristic’), in the
        specific mode of a self-fulfilling prophecy. If people listened, they’d
        bring everything crashing down.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s no less crucial to understand that, by inversion, the voice of
        central monetary authority is equally incapable of isolating the
        communication of objective information from the continuous flow of
        psychological operations. When the state monetary apparatus speaks, it
        exercises effective power. It commands. The sole value of fiat currency
        lies in a popular habit of obedience, which the state money power
        systematically sustains. There is no other usage of macro-economic
        signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Buy gold’ is a counter-revolutionary instruction to participate in the
        destruction of the state money system.

        ensure a permanent conservative government — electoral democracy simply
        doesn’t work like that — it’s hard to argue that the result could be
        anything other than an ideological rebound of sorts, with the rump UK’s
        entire political spectrum shunting right. Since such an outcome would
        almost certainly prolong the viability of liberal democracy, perhaps
        even worldwide (due to contagion effects), it would be unseemly for any
        neoreactionary to get adrenalized about it. England would nevertheless

        Every increment of dynamic Anglo capitalism adds resources that will
        eventually be of great use — especially now, with public ledger

        upon the death of the demotic power structure that positive
        techno-commercial advances are simply written off, or worse, derided as
        life-support apparatus for the enemy. Even a minor Anglo-capitalist
        revitalization would produce <em>some</em> deep value (as early, or
        creative destruction-phase Thatcherism did, amid its manifold failures).

        Far more significantly, Scottish secession would mark a turning of the
        tide, with great exemplary potential. Beginning its new life as a hotbed
        of socialist lunacy, an independent Scotland would be forced — very
        rapidly — to grow up, which of course means moving sharply to the right.
        The more theatrical the transitional social crisis, the more thoroughly
        leftism-in-power would be humiliated. As everyone now knows, such
        lessons in the essentially incompetent nature of leftist social
        administration never have any more than a limited effect, since humans
        are congenitally stupid creatures who find profound learning
        next-to-impossible. Despite this, they are the only remotely effective
        lessons history offers. However pitiful mankind’s political-economic
        education may be, it is owed entirely to the disaster spectacle of
        leftism in power. A fresh lesson — the more brutally calamitous the
        better — should always be welcomed unambiguously. If wild-eyed
        socialists were to drive Scotland over a cliff, they would be presenting
        a precious gift to the world thereby. (Sadly, in the opinion of this
        blog, the probability of such an eventuality is relatively low —
        Scottish canniness can be expected to re-assert itself with remarkable
        speed once the Sassenach dupes are no longer subsidizing its
        disappearance.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The secession of Scotland, from the perspective of the rump UK, is
        already a (relative) purge of leftist entropy. With the return of an
        independent Scotland to minimally-functional, and thus moderately
        right-corrected government, this purge becomes absolute. A quantum of
        leftist insanity will have been extinguished, since its condition of
        existence was a relation of political dependency. No one resorts to
        beggary when abandoned, solitary, upon a desert island. Compulsory
        self-reliance mandates adjustment to the right (whether preceded by
        collapse or not).
      </p>
      <p>
        An independent Scotland would work, most probably quite quickly. It then
        lights a beacon of disintegration, first across the Anglosphere, and
        subsequently more widely. The time of fragmentation will have come. The
        present world epoch of democracy will then have arrived at its final
        stage — promoting the break-up of the states it has built (and with
        them, eventually, itself). Scotland could light the touch-paper. It
        would save everybody some time if it did.

      CHAPTER THREE - IDENTITY, INDIVIDUALISM AND INDEPENDENCE
    </h3>
    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/identity-hunger/">

        <a
          href="http://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/progressivism-ist-gemeinschaft-und-gesellschaft-2/">post</a>
        up on this, referencing Nydwracu, who has made a momentous
        <a href="http://theden.tv/#sthash.9IRYhtb8.dpbs">project</a> out of it.
        It’s huge, and old, and quite impossible to summarize persuasively. It’s
        also impossible to avoid, especially for the Outer Right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Sailer told a joke that I’m going to mangle. A monstrous alien
        invasion assails the earth, and people have to decide how to respond.
        The conservatives say, “What’s there to think about? We have to get
        together to defeat this thing.” Liberals respond: “Wait! They probably
        have good reasons to hate us. It must be something we’ve done. Until we
        work out what that is, we should prostrate ourselves before their
        grievances.” Finally the libertarians pipe up: “Do they believe in free
        markets?”
      </p>
      <p>
        An obvious quibble arises with the libertarian punch-line:
        <em>if only</em>.  Libertarians have predominantly demonstrated an
        enthusiasm for alien invasion that is totally detached from any
        market-oriented qualification. As their argument goes —
        <em>the alien invasion<strong> is</strong> the free market</em>.  (We’ll
        need to return to this, indirectly.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1314"></span>The appetite for identity seems to be
        hard-wired in the approximate manner of language, or religion. You have
        to have one (or several) but instinct doesn’t provide it ready made.
        That’s why identity corresponds to a hunger. It’s something people need,
        instinctively, with an intensity that is difficult to exaggerate.
        Symbolically-satiable needs are political rocket fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing an expedient plug for the aching identity socket is as close
        to politics-in-a-nutshell as anything is going to get. At the core of
        every ideology is a determination of the model identity — sect, class,
        race, gender, sexual-orientation … — and mass implementation of this
        ‘consciousness’ is already consummate triumph. After psychological
        latching onto the relevant ‘thede’ takes place, nothing except tactics
        remains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaction seeks to defend the dying thedes among its
        <em>own people</em> — which is already a suggestive  repetition.
        Neoreaction goes meta, in a world in which the proscription of certain
        thedes almost wholly defines concerted enemy action. For one reasonable
        construction of the reactionary mainstream (*ahem*), this is already to
        have arrived at a natural stopping point.
        <em>We want our thedes back</em>. Despite the evident obstacles, or
        obstacle (the Cathedral) in its path, this approach plays into the grain
        of human nature, and thus tends — understandably — to scare those it
        wants to scare. If it begins to work, it will face a serious fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Outside in</em>, whose mission is awkwardness, is determined to
        complicate things. Even the most resolute thedens will probably welcome
        the first appendix, which draws attention to the peculiar introduction
        of truly morbid <em>punitive identifications</em>. There’s no reason to
        think this is new — Nietzsche denounced Christianity for doing it — but
        it rises to unmistakable prominence during the decadence of modernity.
        Primary identifications, for select — targeted — groups, cease to be
        positive thedes, except insofar as these have become radically
        negativized. What ‘one’ is, primarily, if not shielded by credible
        victimage, is some postmodern variant of the <em>sinner</em> (racist,
        cisgendered, oppressor). Such is the hunger for identity, that even
        these toxic formations of imposed psychic auto-destruction are
        <em>embraced</em>, creating a species of cringing guilt-consumed
        sacrificial animals, penned within the contours of ‘our’ old thedes.
        Redemption is promised to those who most fully resign themselves to
        their own identitarian toxicity, who thus attain a perverse superiority
        over those insufficiently convinced of the need for salvation through
        self-abolition. “We really, <em>really</em> deserve to die” beats out a
        weak “We really deserve to die,” and anybody who still thinks that it’s
        OK to live is simply<em> lost</em>. (Only <em>sinners</em> are included
        in this arms-race, and the Cathedral tells us clearly who they are.)
      </p>
      <p>
        An additional complication will be far less digestible, which is
        precisely why I would like to align it with the <em>Outer Right</em>.
        Perhaps escaping this structure of captivity cannot possibly take a
        reverse path, and a heading into dis-identifications, artificial
        identities, and identitarian short-circuits is ‘our’ real destiny. The
        identity-envy of the right — however deeply-rooted in an indisputable
        history of relentless Cathedralist aggression — cannot ever be anything
        but a weakness, given what we know about the political gradient of
        modern time. The fact it knows we want to be something, and
        <em>what it is we want to be</em>, is the alpha and omega of the
        Cathedral’s political competence. It knows what its enemies would be,
        if they could be what they want to be. It does not take a deep immersion
        in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunzi"> Sunzi </a>to realize the
        strategic hopelessness of that situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want the Cathedral to be obliterated by monsters, which it does not
        recognize, understand, or possess antibodies against. There is an
        idiosyncratic element to that, admittedly. I identify far more with the
        East India Company that the United Kingdom, with the hybrid Singlosphere
        than the British people, with clubs and cults than nations and creeds,
        with Yog Sothoth than my ancestral religion, and with
        <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/pythia-unbound/">Pythia</a> than the
        Human Security System. I think true cosmopolitans — such as the
        adventurers of late 19th century Shanghai (both English and Chinese) —
        are superior to the populist rabble from which nationalism draws its
        recruits. That’s just me.
      </p>
      <p>
        What isn’t just me, is what the Cathedral knows how to beat. That, I
        strongly suspect, at least in the large majority of cases, is you.

        <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114223/margaret-thatcher-reviewed-john-gray">makes</a>
        some telling observations about the debilitating practical paradoxes of
        the late-20th century right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Summing up Thatcher’s outlook, </em>[Charles]<em>
          Moore writes of her “unusual mindset, which was both conservative and
          revolutionary.” It is a shrewd observation, but Thatcher’s reactionary
          nostalgia and revolutionary dynamism had something in common: the
          sturdy individualism to which she looked back was as much a fantasy as
          the renewed bourgeois life she projected into the future.<br /> </em><br />
        Once ‘sturdy individualism’ is dismissed as a fantasy, a horror story of
        some kind is the only imaginable outcome. If people are really too
        pathetic to take responsibility for their lives, what else could we
        possibly expect?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="more-1064"></span>It has surely to be granted that anybody
        useless enough to be inadequate to the basics of their own survival, is
        scarcely going to exhibit the altruistic surplus value required to
        effectively take care of anybody else. Maybe God will make good the
        deficit, or — to plunge fully into feel-good superstition — ‘society’?
        The ultimate implication of Gray’s argument is that humans aren’t fit to
        live. (Which isn’t to say that he’s wrong.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The future belongs to frontier people. If no significant fraction of the
        human species is any longer capable of being that, then it’s time for an
        evolutionary search for something that is. Don’t expect it to be pretty.

    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        Everyone’s seen
        <a href="http://therightstuff.biz/2015/11/05/libertarianism-and-marxism-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/">this</a>
        argument a million times: “So what’s the problem with libertarianism?
        The problem is that if you put two groups one against another, the one
        who is best able to work together will overcome the group of
        individualists.”
      </p>
      <p>
        An example would be nice. Here are the major modern wars of necessity
        (or existential conflicts) the Anglosphere has been involved in (‘win’
        here meaning ‘came out on the winning side’ — conniving to get others to
        do most of the dying is an Anglo-tradition in itself):
      </p>
      <p>
        English Civil War (1642-1651) — Protestant individualists win.<br />
        War of the Spanish Succession (17012-1714) — Protestant individualists
        win.<br />
        Seven Years War (1756-1763) — Protestant individualists win.<br />
        American War of Independence (1775-1783) — Protestant individualists
        win.<br />
        Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) — Protestant individualists win.<br />
        American Civil War (1861-1865) — Protestant individualists win.<br />
        First World War (1914-1918) — Anglophone individualists win.<br />
        Second World War (1939-1945) — Anglophone individualists win.<br />
        Cold War (1947-1989) — Anglophone individualists win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have I missed any big ones? I’m simply not seeing the “history is the
        graveyard of failed individualist societies” picture that seems to be
        consolidating itself as a central alt-right myth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t a moral thing. I get (without great sympathy) the
        “organically cohesive societies <em>should</em> win” mantra. If there’s
        any evidence at all that it’s a judgment endorsed by Gnon, feel free to
        bring the relevant <strong>facts</strong> to the comment thread.

        The Atomization Trap
      </h4>
    </a>
    <div class="article-content">
      <p>
        “Hands up everyone who hates atomization.” That isn’t a call for
        surrender (at least overtly), but merely an informal poll.
      </p>
      <p>Now try it differently:</p>
      <p>
        “Hands up everyone who hates atomization, but this time
        <em>without looking around</em>.” Was the decision-process – perhaps
        ironically – a little slower this time? It’s worth thinking about that.
        Taking a shortcut that bypasses the social process might be expected to
        speed things up. Yet on the other hand – introducing the delay – comes
        the hazy recognition: If you make the call privately, you’re already
        complicit. A minor formal re-organization of the question transforms it
        insidiously.
        <em>What do you think of atomization, speaking atomistically?</em> It
        becomes a strange, or self-referential loop. Modern history has been
        like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, though, a few terminological preliminaries. An ‘atom’ is
        etymologically indistinct from an ‘individual.’ At the root, the words
        are almost perfectly interchangeable. Neither, relative to the other,
        carries any special semantic charge. So if ‘atomization’ sounds like a
        metaphor, it really isn’t. There’s nothing essentially derivative about
        the word’s sociological application. If it appears to be a borrowing
        from physics, that might be due to any number of confusions, but not to
        a displacement from an original or natural terrain. Atoms and societies
        belong together primordially, though in tension. That’s what being a
        social animal – rather than a fully ‘eusocial’ one (like an ant, or a
        mole-rat) – already indicates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals are hard to find. Nowhere are they simply and reliably
        <em>given</em>, least of all to themselves. They require historical
        work, and ultimately fabrication, even to float them as functional
        approximations. A process is involved. That’s why the word ‘atomization’
        is less prone to dupery than ‘atom’ itself is. Individuality is nothing
        outside a destiny (but this is to get ahead of ourselves).
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s difficult to know where to begin. (Did Athens sentence Socrates to
        death for being a social atomizer?) Individualism is stereotypically
        WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic), and so
        tends to lead into the labyrinth of comparative ethnography. It has been
        unevenly distributed, in roughly the same way that modernity has been.
        Since this is already to say almost everything on the topic, it merits
        some dismantling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work of Walter Russell Mead provides a useful relay station.  The
        historical questions he has engaged – which concern nothing less than
        <em>the outcome of the world</em> – have been embedded within an
        intellectual framework shaped by special attention to modern
        providential Christianity. What has been the source of the ‘manifest
        destiny’ which has placed the keys to global mastery in the hands of a
        progressively distilled social project, Protestant, then Puritan, then
        Yankee? If not exactly or straightforwardly ‘God’ (he is too subtle for
        that), it is at least something that the lineage of Reform Christianity
        has tapped with unique effectiveness. Protestantism sealed a pact with
        historical destiny – to all appearances defining a specifically modern
        global teleology – by consistently winning. Individualization of
        conscience – <em>atomization</em> – was made fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six years after <em>Special Providence</em> (2001) came
        <em>God and Gold</em>, which reinforced the Anglo-American and
        capitalistic threads of the narrative. The boundaries between
        socio-economic and religious history were strategically melted, in a way
        pioneered by Max Weber, Werner Sombart, and – more critically – by
        numerous Catholic thinkers who have identified, and continue to
        identify, the essence of modernity as a hostile religious power. Eugene
        Michael Jones is Walter Russell Mead on the other side of the mirror.
        The story each is telling transforms without significant distortion into
        that of the other, once chilled below the threshold of moral agitation.
        Whatever it was that happened to Western Christianity in the Renaissance
        unleashed capitalism upon the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to be still cruder without sacrificing much reality. When
        considered as rigid designations, Atomization, Protestantism,
        Capitalism, and Modernity name exactly the same thing. In the domain of
        public policy (and beyond it), <em>privatization</em> addresses the same
        directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        While any particular variant of implicit or explicit Protestantism has
        its distinctive theological (or atheological) features, just as any
        stage of capitalistic industrialization has its concrete
        characteristics, these serve as distractions more than as hand-holds in
        the big picture. The only truly big picture is <em>splitting</em>.  The
        Reformation was not only a break, but still more importantly a
        normalization of breaking, an initially informal, but increasingly
        rigorized, protocol for social disintegration. The ultimate solution it
        offered in regard to all social questions was not argumentation, but
        exit. Chronic fission was installed as the core of historical process.
        Fundamentally, that is what atomization means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protestantism – <em>Real Abstract Protestantism</em> – which is ever
        more likely to identify itself as post-Christian, post-theistic, and
        post-Everything Else, is a self-propelling machine for incomprehensibly
        prolonged social disintegration, <em>and everyone knows it</em>. 
        Atomization has become an autonomous, inhuman agency, or at least,
        something ever more autonomous, and ever more inhuman. It can only
        liquidate everything you’ve ever cared about, by its very nature, so –
        of course – no one likes it. Catholicism, socialism, and nationalism
        have sought, in succession, coalition, or mutual competition, to rally
        the shards of violated community against it.  The long string of defeat
        that ensued has been a rich source of cultural and political mythology.
        Because there is really no choice but to resist, battle has always been
        rejoined, but without any serious sign of any reversal of fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under current conditions, atomization serves – uniquely – as an
        inexhaustible tube of reactionary glue. Profound aversion to the process
        is the sole common denominator of our contemporary cultural opposition,
        stretching from traditionalist Catholicism to alt-right
        ethno-nationalism. “Whatever our preferred glue, can’t we at least agree
        that things have become unglued – and are ever less glued?” That seems
        very far from an unreasonable aspiration. After all, if coalition
        building is the goal, what – imaginably – could provide a better
        rallying point than the very principle of social integrity, even if this
        is invoked purely, and negatively, by way of an anathematization
        directed at its fatal historic foe? Atomization, in this regard, brings
        people together, at least conversationally, though this works best when
        the conversation doesn’t get very deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely anybody wants to be atomized (they say). Perhaps they read
        Michel Houellebecq’s 1998 novel <em>Atomised</em> (or
        <em>Elementary Particles</em>), and nod along to it. How could one not?
        If that’s where it ended, it would be hard to see the problem, or how
        there ever came to be a problem, but it doesn’t end there, or anywhere
        close, because atomization makes a mockery of words. Atomization was
        never good at parties, unsurprisingly. It’s unpopular to the point of
        essence. There’s the Puritan thing, and the Ayn Rand thing, and the nerd
        thing, and the trigger for Asperger’s jokes – if that’s actually a
        separate thing – and no doubt innumerable further social disabilities,
        each alone disqualifying, if receiving a ‘like’ in some collective
        medium is the goal, because nobody likes it, as we’ve heard (for half a
        millennium already). But what we’ve heard, and what we’ve seen, have
        been two very different things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Atomization never tried to sell itself. Instead, it came free, with
        everything else that was sold. It was the formal implication of dissent,
        first of all, of methodical skepticism, or critical inquiry, which
        presupposed a bracketing of authority that proved irreversible, and then
        – equally implicit originally – the frame of the contractual relation,
        and every subsequent innovation in the realm of the private deal (there
        would be many, and we have scarcely started). “So what do
        <em>you</em> think (or want)?” That was quite enough. No articulate
        enthusiasm for atomization was ever necessary. The sorcery of revealed
        preference has done all the work, and there, too, we have scarcely
        started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Atomization may have few friends, but it has no shortage of formidable
        allies. Even when people are readily persuaded that atomization is
        undesirable, they ultimately want to decide for themselves, and the more
        so as they think that it matters. Insofar as atomization has become a
        <em>true horror</em>, it compels an intimate cognitive and moral
        relation with itself. No one who glimpses what it is can delegate
        relevant conclusions to any higher authority. Thus it wins. Every
        Catholic of intellectual seriousness has seen this, for centuries.
        Socialists have too, for decades. The moment of ethno-nationalist
        revelation cannot long be delayed. Under modern conditions, every
        authoritative moral community is held hostage to private decision, even
        when it is apparently affirmed, and especially when such affirmation is
        most vehemently asserted. (The most excitable elements within the world
        of Islam see this arriving, and are conspicuously unhappy about the
        fact.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Substantially, if only notionally, freedom of conscience might tend to
        collectivity, but formally it locks-in individualism ever more tightly.
        It defies the authority of community at the very moment it offers
        explicit endorsement, by making community an urgent matter of private
        decision, and – at the very peak of its purported sacredness – of
        <em>shopping</em>. Religious traditionalists see themselves mirrored in
        whole-food markets, and are appalled, when not darkly amused.
        “Birkenstock Conservatives” was Rod Dreher’s grimly ironic
        self-identification. Anti-consumerism becomes a consumer preference, the
        public cause a private enthusiasm. Intensification of collectivist
        sentiment only tightens the monkey-trap.  It gets worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        American history – at the global frontier of atomization – is thickly
        speckled with <em>elective communities</em>. From the Puritan religious
        communities of the early colonial period, through to the ‘hippy’
        communes of the previous century, and beyond, experiments in communal
        living under the auspices of radicalized private conscience have sought
        to ameliorate atomization in the way most consistent with its historical
        destiny. Such experiments reliably fail, which helps to crank the
        process forward, but that is not the main thing. What matters most about
        all of these co-ops, communes, and cults is the semi-formal contractual
        <em>option</em> that frames them. From the moment of their initiation –
        or even their conception – they confirm a sovereign atomization, and its
        reconstruction of the social world on the model of a menu. Dreher’s
        much-discussed ‘Benedict Option’ is no exception to this. There is no
        withdrawal from the course of modernity, ‘back’ into community, that
        does not reinforce the pattern of dissent, schism, and exit from which
        atomization continually replenishes its momentum. As private conscience
        directs itself towards escape from the privatization of conscience, it
        regenerates that which it flees, ever more deeply within itself.
        Individuation, considered impersonally, likes it when you run.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is well understood, ‘atoms’ are not atoms, and ‘elements’ are not
        elements. Elementary particles – if they exist at all – are at least two
        (deep) levels further down. Human individuals are certainly no less
        decomposable. Marvin Minsky’s ‘society of mind’ is but one vivid
        indication of how historical sociology might tilt into the sub-atomic
        realm. Particle accelerators demonstrate that shattering entities down
        to the smallest attainable pieces is a technological problem. The same
        holds in the social realm, though naturally with very different
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To dismiss individuals as metaphysical figments, therefore, would be the
        most futile of diversions. Atomization has no constraining metaphysics,
        whether in particle physics or in the dynamic anthropological,
        socio-historical process. If it promises at times to tell you what you
        really are, such whispers will eventually cease, or come to deride
        themselves, or simply be forgotten. Protestantism, it has to be
        remembered, is only masked, momentarily, as a religion. What it is
        underneath, and enduringly, is a way of breaking things.
      </p>
      <p>
        After so much has already been torn apart, with so many monstrosities
        spawned, it is no doubt exhausting to be told that while almost
        everything remains to be built, no less still waits to be broken.
        Atomization has already gone too far, we are incessantly told. If so,
        the future will be hard. There can be no realistic doubt that it will be
        extremely divided. The dynamo driving things tends irresistibly in that
        direction. Try to split, and it whirls faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hands up everyone who hates atomization.” No, that isn’t a question
        anymore. It would be a call for surrender, if surrender mattered, but it
        doesn’t, as we’ve seen. Keep on fighting it, by all means. It likes
        that.

    <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-universalism/">
      <h4 class="post-title">Against Universalism</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        There’s a philosophical objection to any refusal of universalism that
        will be familiar from other uses (the denunciation of relativism, most
        typically). It requires only one step:
        <em>Isn’t the denial of the universal itself a universalist claim?</em>
        It’s a piece of malignant dialectics because it demands that we agree.
        We don’t, and won’t ever, agree. Agreement is the worst thing that could
        happen. Merely assent to its necessity, and global communism, or some
        close analog, is the implicit conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a universal truth, it belongs only to Gnon, and Gnon is a
        dark (occulted) God. Traditional theists will be at least strongly
        inclined to disagree — <em>and that is excellent</em>. We disagree
        already, and we have scarcely begun.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no ‘good life for man’ (in general) — or if there is we know
        nothing of it, or not enough. Even those persuaded that they do, on the
        contrary, know what such a life should be, promote its universality only
        at the expense of being denied the opportunity to pursue it. If we need
        to agree on the broad contours of such a model for human existence, then
        reaching agreement will precede it — and ‘reaching agreement’ is
        politics. Some much wider world acquires a veto over the way of life you
        select, or accept, or inherit (the details need not detain us). We have
        seen how that works. Global communism is the inevitable destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alternative to agreement is schism. Secession, geopolitical
        disintegration, fragmentation, splitting — disagreement escapes
        dialectics and separates in space. Anti-universalism, concretely, is not
        a philosophical position but an effectively defensible assertion of
        diversity. From the perspective of the universal (which belongs only to
        Gnon, and never to man), it is an experiment. The degree to which it
        believes in itself is of no concern that matters to anything beyond
        itself. It is not answerable to anything but Gnon. What anyone,
        anywhere, thinks about it counts for nothing. If it fails, it dies,
        <em>which should mean nothing to you</em>. If you are compelled to care
        about someone else’s experiment, then a schism is missing. Of course,
        you are free to tell it that you think it will fail, if it is listening,
        but there is absolutely no need to reach agreement on the question. This
        is what, in the end, non-communism means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-universalism is hygiene. It is practical avoidance of other people’s
        stupid shit. There is no higher principle in political philosophy. Every
        attempt to install an alternative, and impose a universal, reverts to
        dialectics, communization, global evangelism, and totalitarian politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is being said here now, because NRx is horribly bad at it, and
        degenerates into a clash of universalisms, as into an instinctive
        equilibrium. There are even those who confidently propose an ‘NRx
        solution’ for the world. Nothing could be more absurd. The world — as a
        whole — is an entropy bin. The most profoundly degraded communism is its
        only possible ‘universal consensus’. (Everyone knows this, when they
        permit themselves to think.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All order is local — which is to say
        <em>the negation of the universal</em>. That is merely to re-state the
        second law of thermodynamics, which ‘we’ generally profess to accept.
        The only thing that could ever be universally and equally distributed is
        noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kill the universalism in your soul and you are immediately (objectively)
        a neoreactionary. Protect it, and you are an obstacle to the escape of
        differences. That is communism — whether you recognize it, or not.

        Preliminary throat-clearing (as in part

        its most rigorous construction, ‘universalism’ is robust under
        conditions of rational argument (i.e. evidence-based logico-mathematical
        criticism). Mathematical theorems, in particular [sic], are universal
        truths. Any assertions that can be constructed to a comparable level of
        formal rigor (and ultimately <em>mechanization</em>) can lay claim to
        the same status. However, with the slightest departure from this —
        rigidly algorithmic — criterion, controversy rapidly begins. This is not
        the place and time to argue the case for transcendental philosophy
        (within which praxeology in included), but such a case could be made.
        Ditto strictly proceduralized empirical science. All of this is a
        digression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of universalism as it concerns us here is not a matter of
        meta-mathematics, epistemology, or the philosophy of science. It is
        rather directed at <em>the political scope of argument</em>. Is it
        mandatory to demand that argument, according to the highest principles
        of (logical) cognitive compulsion, be imposed globally? Does the quality
        of argument — however exalted — require its unrestricted application
        across space and time? It is the affirmative response to
        <em>this</em> question that defines universalism in its ideological
        sense. Pure Jacobinism, of course, answers <em>yes</em>. There is a
        universal duty to compel submission to the truth. This is the secular
        form of evangelical salvationism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contrary suggestion, here defended, is that — under real global
        conditions — universalism is a catastrophic mistake. The social scope of
        rational discussion is itself strictly bounded, and attempts to extend
        it (coercively) beyond such limits are politically disastrous.
        <em>Laissez-faire</em> envelops the sphere of imperative rationality,
        and respects its practical contour. Stupidity does not need to be hunted
        down and exterminated. All historical evidence indicates that it cannot
        be.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the universal triumph of reason is an impractical goal, democratic
        globalism is exposed as a preposterous error. Minimizing the voice of
        stupidity is the realistic — and already extremely challenging —
        alternative. Rare enclaves of rigorously self-critical realism have as
        their primary obligation the self-protection of their (evidently
        precarious) particularity. In the wider world, fanatical ignorance and
        grotesque cognitive malformation rage rampantly. Borders, filters,
        tests, and selection mechanisms of all kinds provide the only defenses
        against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The universalist (Jacobin) model is always a conversation.
        <em>You have to join together first, simply to talk, and after that
          reason will prevail</em>. That’s the path of the <em>Zeitgeist</em> — Hegelianism at its most
        arcane, expedient progressivism at more common levels of popularity —
        with its twin-stroke motor of aggressive proselytization and mass
        embrace.<br />
        “Invade the world, invite the world” is the Sailer

        (quasi-random link). <em>Amalgamate, then elevate</em> (in the direction
        of ascending rationality). This isn’t a (theoretically convincing) claim
        about the unique structure of mathematical proof, it’s a (factually
        trashed) claim about the global uniformity of human brains. The
        ‘universality’ it invokes is that of convergence upon the authority of
        reason. In other words, it’s a bizarre progressive myth that all
        self-protective sanity seeks to maximally distance itself from.
      </p>

        People learn, but only very rarely through sophisticated argument, or
        its ‘<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1404677?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">cunning</a>‘ socio-political
        avatars. They learn because they fail badly, and it
        hurts. ‘Mankind’ is a progressive myth, incapable of learning anything.
        When real cultures learn, it is because they have been locked in
        intimate particularity, such that the consequences of their own
        cognitive processes impact intensely upon them. Anything that separates
        an individual, or a group, from the results of its own thoughts, is an
        apparatus of anti-learning. Progressive universalism is precisely this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dis-amalgamation — isolation — is the way to learn. It’s how speciation
        happens, long before learning becomes neurological. Individuation (at
        whatever scale) establishes the foundation for trade, communication, and
        intellectual exchange. Micro-states commercialize. Macro-states decay
        into political resource allocation, and entropic sludge. Protect your
        own patch if you want to have anything to talk about.

      <h4 class="post-title">Independence</h4>
    </a>
    <div class="entry">
      <p>
        The philosophical antonym to ‘<a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/against-universalism-ii/">universality</a>‘ is
        ‘particularity’. Its broader, ideological antonym is something
        closer to <em>independence</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t a word greatly emphasized by NRx up to this point, or — for
        that matter — one figuring prominently in contemporary discussions of
        any kind. That’s strange, because it orchestrates an extraordinary set
        of conceptual connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Independence is a rough synonym for <em>sovereignty</em>, to begin with.
        The profound association between these terms bears quite extreme
        analytical pressure. The sovereign is that instance capable of
        independent decision. An independent state is indistinguishable from a
        sovereign one, and to impugn its real sovereignty is to question its
        effective independence. Secession is a process of independence. A
        (Moldbuggian) Patchwork is a network of independent geopolitical
        entities. All relevant trends to geopolitical fragmentation are
        independence-oriented. Each executed <em>Exit</em> option (even on a
        shopping expedition) is an implicit declaration of independence, at
        least in miniature. (The relations between <em>independence</em> and
        <em>connectivity</em> are subtle and complex.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Remaining (for a moment) in the narrowest NRx channel, the entire
        passivism discussion is independence related. Protest (‘activism’) is
        disdained on account of its fundamental dependency (upon sympathetic
        political toleration). No social process genuinely directed towards
        independence would fall within the scope of this criticism. (The
        ‘Benedict Option’ is one obvious
        <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-benedict-option-reactionary/">example</a>.) ‘Build
        something’ epitomizes independence process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cannot the entire range of contentions over the individualism /
        collectivism dyad be recast in terms of independence? Dependency exists
        on a spectrum, but the defining attitude towards it tends to
        polarization. Is dependence to be embraced, or configured as a problem
        to be worked against? This blog is highly tempted to project the Left /
        Right or ‘principal political’ dimension along the axis these distinct
        responses define. The Left is <em>enthused</em> by inter-dependency, and
        (to a greater or lesser extent) <em>accepts</em> comparative
        independence, while for the Right this attitudinal system is exactly
        reversed. (The most fundamental tensions within the reactosphere are
        clearly related to this articulation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        One inevitable point of contention — honed over decades of objection to
        libertarianism — is captured by the question:
        <em>Are not children essentially dependents?</em> Yes, of course they
        are, but is growing up anything other than a process of independence?
        From one perspective, a family can be interpreted as a model of
        inter-dependence (without obvious inaccuracy). Yet, from another, a
        family is an independence-production unit, both in its comparative
        autonomy in respect to the wider society, and as a child-rearing matrix.
        Families are loci of independence struggle (to which the Left response
        is: <em>They shouldn’t have to be</em>). Dependency culture is the Left
        heartland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Independence and autonomy are very closely related terms. All
        discussions of autonomy, and even of automation, click quite neatly onto
        this template, but this is a point exceeding the ambitions of the
        present post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstraction, too, is a topic the tantalizingly overlaps independence.
        Whether cognitive independence
        <em>entirely accommodates intelligence optimization</em> is also a
        question for another occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRx, XS tentatively proposes, is
        <em>a political philosophy oriented to the promotion of independence</em>. (Much pushback is, naturally,
        expected.)

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">North Korea’s nuclear test on September 3 was registered as a
          rare
          literal geopolitical earthquake. Some public uncertainty persists
          about the scale and significance of the tremor. It has been reported
          in a range of magnitudes from 6.1 to 6.3 (or even higher), on the
          logarithmic Richter Scale. An event of this size suggests an explosion
          of several hundred kilotons of TNT, and is consistent with the
          detonation of a thermonuclear device. North Korean confirmation of
          exactly this occurrence has been received with unprecedented
          seriousness.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Nuclear non-proliferation is more idea than reality. Its only
          substance is a comparative sluggishness when estimated against the
          benchmark of some generally unstated nightmare scenario. According to
          such counter-factual consideration, nuclear weapons </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>might</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          have been more widespread than they are by now. But exponential
          processes look like this. They start small, and don’t seem to be going
          anywhere dramatic for a while. As the celebrated
          <a href="http://mathforum.org/sanders/geometry/GP11Fable.html">fable</a>
          of exponentiation shows, a modest bowl of rice gets you quite a long
          way into the chess board. The supposedly common-sense assumption that </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>uncontrollable nuclear proliferation isn’t yet
            happening</i></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          requires an argument. (This short essay makes the other
          argument.)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">The nuclear ‘club’ is too unwieldy to share any kind of
          seriously
          constraining principle. There is nothing identifiable that entitles a
          nation to membership, beyond naked possession of doomsday-tier
          military capability. The club was trans-ideological from the start,
          and quite soon afterwards highly multicultural. Among members,
          reciprocal distrust and even hostility is the norm, which – given the
          runaway action-reaction process that settled the membership roster –
          could scarcely be unexpected. The behavior of members is controlled by
          nothing beyond game theory. It’s also very much worth mentioning that
          nobody who manages to get into the club can, in any practical way, be
          thrown out.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">The United States detonated the world’s first thermonuclear,
          two-stage, fusion, or (Teller-Ulam
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon">design</a>) ‘hydrogen’ bomb at Enewetak Atoll on
          November 1, 1952. The Soviet
          Union responded less than a year later, testing its own H-bomb on
          August 12, 1953. Tests – or demonstrations – followed in succession
          from The United Kingdom (November 1957), China (June 17, 1967), and
          France (August 1968). Israel is thought to have conducted a joint test
          with the Republic of South Africa – the so-called ‘Vela Incident’ – in
          September 22, 1979. In 1991 the South African government claimed to
          have assembled, and later unilaterally dismantled, six nuclear
          devices. India expanded the spiral of thermonuclear proliferation into
          South Asia with a test in May 1998. Pakistan is not known to have
          tested anything beyond ‘boosted fission’ devices, but it formidable
          nuclear capability is not in question. (A longer essay would have
          found space at this point to acknowledge Pakistani Abdul Qadeer Khan’s
          disproportionate contribution to the global proliferation dynamic.)
          Saudi nuclear cooperation with Pakistan can be expected to accelerate
          the spread of nuclear weaponry into the Arabian Peninsula, once
          Iranian progress in the military application of the technology
          triggers the long-anticipated Sunni-Shia arms-race in weapons of mass
          destruction. Hence the chain of proliferation steadily lengthens on
          its main axis, through Cold War superpower rivalry, into Chinese
          triangulation, a responsive Indian bomb, and then into the fractured
          world of Islam, via Pakistan (with unreciprocated Israeli nuclear
          prowess as additional prompt, and pretext).
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">The one-dimensional character of this narrative is an
          artifact
          of its
          immaturity. The under-development of the proliferation process appears
          to present the ‘international community’ with no more than a single
          crisis at any time. Things will not look this way for long. There is
          nothing essentially mono-linear about the dynamic of cross-escalation.
          Increasing momentum is already taking it off the tracks. As Richard
          Fernandez
          <a href="https://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2017/10/13/after-the-smash/">notes</a>, lines of nuclear escape

            Disruptive technological change and new modes of warfare associated

          January
          2016, following fission device tests in 2006, 2009, and 2013). Whether
          as a matter of analytical realism, or of strategically motivated
          public skepticism, the claim was met by orchestrated Western
          disparagement. The 2017 test shattered this wall of denial. In the
          words of Scott D. Sagan, writing at Foreign Affairs: “North Korea no
          longer poses a nonproliferation problem; it poses a nuclear deterrence
          problem”</span>

          is not
          yet impossible to see a process of deceleration in this time-line,
          such an optic is ceasing to convince. It seems to be part of a
          collapsing world order, which is taking its structures of perception
          down with it. The assumption of continuity, for instance, now seems

          in the proliferation dynamic has been especially notable over recent
          decades, due to a hardening pattern whose incentive effects could not
          easily be more ominous. The surrender of thermonuclear ambitions has
          acquired a stark correlation with subsequent regime destruction,
          unlike anything seen in the previous era of Cold War superpower

          decision no doubt appeared rational – and even prudent. Subsequent
          regional developments make it far harder to excuse. It remains to be
          seen whether Ukrainian national independence will have finally been
          sacrificed to this high-minded call, but rudimentary geopolitical and

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">In respect to strategic fundamentals, however, the regime’s
          feral
          punk-performance attitude to diplomatic conduct is not the principal
          issue. Bad attitude makes for stimulating diplomatic theater, but it
          decorates the fundamentals of threat. </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>Focus on
            capabilities, not motivations</i></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">, is a strategic
          principle that cannot be over-stressed. In the case
          of North Korea, and others no doubt soon to follow, however, it is a
          principle that requires complete inversion. A definite </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>incapacity</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          rises, instead, to strategic prominence.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">The extremity of the emerging North Korean threat is a
          function
          of
          weakness, in many respects, but most centrally regarding its new
          responsibilities for deterrence management. Insecure nuclear arsenals
          are destabilizing, since they incline to first use, on the </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>use-it-or-lose-it</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          principle. Vulnerability to a first-strike is a continuous prompt to
          pre-emption.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">North Korea is a geographically small nation, with crude
          command-control structures, very limited early warning capabilities,
          and an exclusive reliance on exposed land-based ballistic missile
          platforms for warhead delivery. In other words, it is destined to
          remain on a hair-trigger from the moment it crosses the deterrence
          threshold. Rather than being a splitting headache to the world order
          by relentless, malignant initiative, it will henceforth be one by
          simple strategic default. The world will have become a city built
          under Vesuvius, quite regardless of any planning decisions or
          philosophies of risk. An epoch of peril is opening.

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Under these conditions, mere ‘capability’ becomes
          extraordinarily
          provocative, and

          is automatically terrorizing. Yet, while this dilemma is not difficult
          to understand, it is perhaps a little </span><span

          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          difficult to be captured by any public debate conducted at a
          realistically imaginable level of sophistication. Insofar as there is
          anything like a court of global mass opinion, it can be confidently
          expected to miss the strategic essentials and lose itself in
          multilateral theater performances. Geostrategic realities and mass
          perceptions are on diverging trajectories.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">The prevalent delusions tend to be simplifying, and retarded
          (in the
          strict sense). They lag the diffusive trend, and thus invoke
          unrealistically economical structures of agency, drawn back towards
          the long-lost ideal of bipolarity. The age of superpowers still
          dominates the nuclear imagination.

          in
          a pit
          full of diplomatic punji sticks, the temptation is to fantasize a road
          through Beijing. No such thoroughfare exists. Relations between China
          and the North Korean regime have reached their lowest point since the
          Korean War, and are now frankly hostile. The Kim Jong-un regime has

          or, in China, unimagined. After all, the natural target of a
          deterrent is the greatest threat to the wielding nation’s sovereignty.
          It is near-inevitable that China will occupy this role in the North
          Korean case. Chinese impotence in respect to North Korea is what the
          North Korean nuclear arsenal is largely – and perhaps even primarily –
          about.

          and even a “malicious AI” who acquires strategic agency. Evidently,
          already half a century ago, Heinlein is exploring a durable cluster of

          of game theory to nuclear strategy remains the point of ingress into
          this world. The core reality of MAD games is easily misunderstood.
          Massive (or non-reiterating) retaliation is – </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>at
            the stage it comes due</i></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">

          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          to contribute anything but compounded harm, regardless of its
          occasion. Under hypothetical conditions of amnesia and unconstrained
          action, it can never make sense. Yet, paradoxically, the ability to
          make credible retaliatory threats is the basic underpinning of
          rationality during prior negotiation games. Without it, there can be
          no </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>reason</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          for competitor restraint. The requirement, then, is for a future agent
          to be firmly committed to a conditional course of action that – at the
          potential point of execution – will be non-compelling.

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Mutual assured destruction has been derided for its madness,
          but it
          is no less an outer-limit of sanity. Its logic is as rigorously
          implacable as any found within the social and historical sciences. The
          extreme moral disturbance that it arouses speaks in favor of its
          uncompromised rationality. Anguished intuition counts for nothing in
          its cold calculus, unless as a technical obstacle. The fact that
          people find this logic of inherited fatal commitments intolerable, as
          dramatized with exceptional vividness in the opening sequences of the
          1983 movie </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>WarGames</i></span><span

          problem. The process is re-routed by our squeamishness, but not at all
          derailed. It has long been suspected that humans are too weak for MAD.

      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">As an expression of absolute commitment, suicide terrorism
          appears to
          provide MAD with a microscopic model, but it is a weak and misleading
          one. Beyond difference in scale, suicide terrorism fails through
          execution. It communicates through actualization – or demonstration of
          will – which is the negative of deterrence. (Or perhaps, deterrence of
          a kind, expensively purchased.) The terror at the edge of the present,
          and of the future, has different models. Among these,
          civilization-scale ‘quantum suicide’ is perhaps the most exotic
          philosophical and ideological
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality">conception</a>
          on its way to us. Given the assumption of a (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.1283.pdf">Level-3</a>
          or higher) multiverse, comprehensive apocalypse is rationalized as the
          pruning of sub-optimal branches. It operates as reality editing. The
          game theoretic consequences of such a perspective are intriguing. It
          increases the credibility of threats (if accepted as a serious
          intellectual commitment), while adapting the pay-off matrix in a
          fashion that can only be considered destabilizing. Classic MAD works
          best among those who envisage an outcome as the worst thing in the
          world, yet commit to it anyway.

      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">We approach here one of the very deepest problems in social
          and
          institutional engineering. It might be called the </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>Odysseus Problem</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. In sailing past the Sirens, Odysseus anticipated the subversion
          of
          commitment, and thus put in place a socio-technical mechanism to bind
          his own future action. The structure is that of a ‘chicken game’ – a
          mutant variant of prisoner’s dilemma, in which </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>the
            player who swerves loses</i></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. If you </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>could</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          back down, you </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>might</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. In both Odysseus’ dilemma and that of the chicken player, the
          elimination of future discretion figures as a strategic resource. The
          requirement for self-binding inclines to a technological freezing of
          decision. Strategic problems of the ‘chicken game’ type thus tend
          inexorably to automation.

      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">If AI is brought into play by the intrinsic dynamics of
          nuclear
          confrontation, it does not stop there. AI has a WMD potentiality
          proper to itself. There is no obvious horizon to what an algorithm
          could do. The same capabilities that enable algorithmic control of WMD
          arsenals equally enable such arsenals to be swapped-out for AI itself.
          An enemy arsenal under algorithmic control is only ‘theirs’ by
          contingencies of software dominance. From the military perspective –
          among others oriented to negative capability – the potential
          destructiveness of the technology is without determinable limit.
          Anything under software control falls into its realm. Which is to say
          that, asymptotically, everything does. But it doesn’t end there. AI
          also promotes an advance into virtuality.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Nuclear weaponry cuts a convergent path into purity of
          conception. No
          hydrogen bomb has yet been used against an enemy (or “in anger” as the
          singularly inappropriate expression goes). Thermonuclear warheads
          remain among a select category of virtual weapons, alongside a variety
          of chemical and biological agents, whose usage has been exclusively
          diplomatic, or even philosophical. The value of this military
          machinery is strictly counter-factual. Those ‘possible worlds’ in
          which they have been operationalized support little, if any, value of
          any kind. Weaponry supporting their potentiality floats the
          ontological option of extreme negative utility. They are – in the most
          rigorous sense – </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>nightmare
            generators</i></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">There is no reason (at all), then, to think that nuclear
          weapons are
          the last word in mass destruction. Nor can it be assumed that mass
          destruction is the ultimate criterion for deterrent weaponry. It is
          not only that high-energy physics opens a vast, rambling bestiary of
          virtual catastrophes which we have scarcely begun to peruse (although
          this is true). Physics has no monopoly on disaster, regardless of what
          its recent privileges might suggest.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">It can never be a virtue for a weapon to be indiscriminate,
          which is
          to say </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>imprecise</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. Turned around, we can say without hesitation or reservation
          that
          it
          is meritorious in any weapon, however absolutely devastating, for the
          greatest possible proportion of the damage it produces to be inflicted
          upon the enemy. In other words, a good weapon discriminates
          specifically against enemy interests. It </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>hunts</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">. There can be no serious doubt that the genomic biosciences and
          software engineering have more to contribute to this pursuit than
          physics possibly could.

          autonomous weapons as a “new, scalable class of WMDs.” The systems he
          is considering would be exemplified by drone swarms, “hunting in packs
          like wolves” (as one DARPA employee was indiscreet enough to reveal).
          Given enormous industrial production runs, performance specifications
          unshackled from human limitation, and targeting algorithms set for
          indiscriminate lethality, the devastating potential of such weapons
          would be hard to exaggerate. Their key, confidently predicted
          vulnerabilities, however, are at least as significant.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">As Russell emphasizes, autonomous weapons could be subverted
          by
          a
          hostile “software update.” They could be hacked. Behind the menace of
          the hacker lies that of advanced artificial intelligence, mustering
          superior powers of cryptographic lock-picking and soft intrusion.
          Autonomous weaponry is therefore nested into a more profound threat.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">AI designates a culmination of sorts. Nowhere else does

          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"> and </span><span

          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          promise to intersect more dynamically. Nothing separates the weapon
          from the game. It also counts, potentially, as an escalation.

          and an extreme </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>deterrent</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          there no definite boundary. The difference is technical. Deterrence is
          a mode of employment. It uses negative utility. In this respect
          anything bad could be useful, were it not that a deterrent requires a
          trigger, under the control of the negotiating agent (at the point of
          negotiation). To threaten a potential aggressor with an asteroid
          strike makes no sense, unless an asteroid strike can be delivered. The
          same holds for geological disasters in general. All of which means
          that the acquisition of engineering capabilities on the largest
          scales, such as geo-engineering, weather control, climate regulation,
          and asteroid defenses – perhaps developed explicitly to avert
          potential </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">existential </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">risks – will inevitably expand the domain of deterrence options.
          In
          other words, techno-economic progress and the escalation of deterrence
          infrastructure are only formally differentiated. There is no
          materially persuasive way to improve the world that does not – on its
          occult side – widen the horizons of geopolitical horror.

      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Beside what could be had, there is the question of who has
          it.
          Beside
          the qualities of WMD-armed antagonists, their mere number is a source
          of terror, itself. It is only natural that multilateral deterrence
          should be found more threatening than its bilateral ideal, and now
          distant predecessor. Complexity scales nonlinearly in networks, and
          quickly becomes mathematically intractable. No one has any idea how
          massively distributed networks of insecurity would work. It is quite
          probably impossible to know. Deterrence is about to change
          phase.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Toothpaste doesn’t return to the tube just because it makes a
          mess.
          Once it is out, inconvenience has ceased to be any kind of argument
          against it. The dangers of a world in which ubiquitous deterrence
          capacity reigns are both obvious and immense. This is nevertheless the
          world we are entering. The trends driving it, from both the
          geopolitical and the techno-economic sides, are by any realistic
          estimation irresistible. Cheaper and more diverse nightmare weaponry
          is becoming available within an increasingly disintegrated
          international order. A variety of self-reinforcing dynamics –
          including but not restricted to those of the arms-race type – are
          further stimulating the process. Cascading acceleration is all but
          inevitable.

      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">When conceived with maximal cynicism (i.e. realism),
          geostrategic
          independence is a direct function of deterrence capability. </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>Don’t tread on me</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          is the colloquial statement, whose perfect applicability is commonly
          under-estimated. The rattlesnake, combining fearsome weaponry with
          signaling, makes for a natural totem of deterrence. Neither venom, nor
          rattle, is dispensable. “Diplomacy without arms is like music without
          instruments,” runs the famous analogy, attributed to Frederick the
          Great. Game theory recognizes military capability as a communication
          medium.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">It is not only that robust independence depends upon
          deterrence.
          Reciprocally, geostrategic liberty necessarily tends to the production
          of deterrence capability. An alien freedom, which </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>could do anything</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">, is – ineliminably – a threat. It provides the comprehensive
          model
          of the military threat. Whether ‘they hate us for our freedom’ or not,
          they have no choice but to fear us for it, and inversely. Geopolitics
          has no other origin. Any state without the will to scare also lacks
          the will to exist.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">It’s all far more basic than we’ve been led to believe. As

          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">In the final analysis, borders are a function of power. If
            you
            can’t defend them, they are just dotted lines. The Kim dynasty’s
            calculation has been that nukes are the ultimate border guards. We
            shall soon find out if that calculation was correct. If so, many
            more states will want them.</span>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">Every geopolitical entity that is serious about sovereignty
          will want
          them, or something of at least equivalent deterrent credibility. The
          only alternative is naked dependency, made ever more uncomfortable by
          increasing global multipolarity, among the stark wreckage of any
          ‘world order’ or ‘international community’ grounded in the collective
          fantasy of miraculously authorized super-national norms. </span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><i>Explosive proliferation</i></span><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
          will be something the world has not seen before, even if it has
          already actually been there to see. We can be confident that the
          geopolitical order will be reconfigured by it.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">What does explosive proliferation mean? Potentially, many
          things. For
          instance, vectors of technological – and thus economic – development
          are certain to be, to some significant degree, oriented by it. As
          artificial intelligence is factored into policy decision-making not
          only as an essential contributor to command, control, communications
          and intelligence (C</span><sup><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">3</span></sup><span
          style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">I), but as an intrinsic weapon of mass destruction, its
          prominence
          will be still further elevated.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">WMD proliferation implies a multiplication of real
          geopolitical
          agencies. It is rigorously indistinguishable – in both directions –
          from a disintegrated world. Established relations of dependency are
          broken, releasing unanticipated – and evidently hazardous – freedoms.
          Whether or not this is the world we want, it looks increasingly
          inevitable that it is the world we are to have.
